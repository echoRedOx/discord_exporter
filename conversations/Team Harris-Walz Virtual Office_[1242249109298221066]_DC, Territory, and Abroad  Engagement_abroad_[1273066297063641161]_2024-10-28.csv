The related software gives callers options to make calls so that you call people at appropriate times (ie not middle of the night). You can call anywhere in those allowed times. So you can call people in Asia, or EU, or Americas, depending on what time it is. It's set up to be pretty failsafe on this point. It's possible to join calls with another volunteer to get the hang of how the software works and what the script reads like."

Thank you both for checking into the details. The fundraising part makes sense. I‚Äôm more interested in spreading the word about the online platform that they created to make it much easier for Americans abroad to submit their request (FPCA form) to receive their ballot under the UOCAVA laws - which require every state to provide the option of overseas voters receiving their ballot electronically and no later than Sept 21.
Their Vote From Abroad .org  website makes it easy to do.
Democrats Aboard promotes it heavily, but put it under a separate nonpartisan organization designation for both legal and practical reasons - for example, I host Voter registration & Overseas Ballot Request events at a local farmers market in Costa Rica, which I can do under the VFA banner. They wouldn‚Äôt allow foreign political action/campaigning, but they will allow nonpartisan voter registration activities. So we publicize heavily to our DA members and on liberal social media, to ensure a strong turnout of Democrats coming for voter assistance but only put ip VFA signage.
Unfortunately, Democrats Abroad has found that another organization is also targeting overseas voters. I‚Äôve seen their paid ads across social media so they have some stronger funding than we have. And, the danger is that their online form submission process doesn‚Äôt actually work consistently. So voters who use their website *think* they are getting registered to vote, but in reality Democrats Abroad has been contacted by LEOs across the country because the forms coming from the competitor‚Äôs website are frequently rejected by the election clerks. That is making it more essential than ever for Democrats to get word out with the accurate information and the link to their own voter registration platform: Vote From Abroad .org so that overseas voters are actually getting registered. How can we promote that here?"

If you know people on the fence (my spouse is Jewish and very upset about Gaza, and we have Lebanese friends here in Berlin who are frantically evacuating family from a new war zone (de-escalation through escalation.), I was able to convince to particpate by saying: ""A lot of people died for us not to have ostensible monarchs.

(If anyone has any good things that are helpful if you know people from Gaza and Lebanon, who would rather US not fund indiscriminate killing of doctors, children, and journalists, that would be nice. For instance, a former colleague of mine spent this week getting his family to Beirut, which will probably be affected soon. He's a data scientist working on longevity, not a terrorist. I wish my tax dollars weren't causing the suffering of his family, and want something useful to say to him. But I hope Harris will be better than the other guy on the topic. AND VOTED FOR HER!!!!!)

The backup will Only count if your main ballot gets disqualified (ie arrives after the deadline or they reject your signature or you forgot a mandatory secrecy envelope etc etc etc).
