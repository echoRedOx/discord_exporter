  content: 'I went to the mobilize sign up to get the link to invite my family and
    friends to the phonebanks I''m facilitating over the next week. I noticed the
    late night shift is listed as 10pm - 11:30pm EDT. Is that accurate? I assumed
    this would be a standard 2 hour shift. I''m going to be facilitating at that time,
    so want to be able to send out the right timeframe. I''m not sure if it can be
    corrected in mobilize. Thanks!

  content: Sorry, my question was about the shift length. Is it 90 minutes or 2 hours?
    The mobilize link shows only 90 minutes for that shift, whereas all the others
    are 2 hours.

  content: Oh, sorry! Yes I do believe it should still be 2 hours. They may have it
    cut off since it is technically the next day at 12:00am?

  content: Yeah, that's what I was thinking as a possibility as well. Thanks for replying.
    I will assume it's 2 hours. I still wonder if they could edit it on mobilize so
    people generally would know what timeframe is expected when signing up. That's
    above my pay grade ($0) though.

  content: I'll flag <@1284539093941878917> here. Sergio, would you mind clarifying
    the time-frame for the 10pm shift, will it be 2-hours like other shifts?
