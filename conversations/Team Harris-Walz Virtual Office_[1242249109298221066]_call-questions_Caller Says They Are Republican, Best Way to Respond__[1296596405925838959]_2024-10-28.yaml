  content: ok you can just mark that refused.  They won't get a call back but it won't
    record as a strong Trump.

  content: if they are just Republicans and are open to engagement/persuasion you
    can absolutely go down that road.  Its up to you to test if the conversation can
    be helpful but you can certainly try!
