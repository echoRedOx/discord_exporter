Content: Is there a link for people who want to volunteer online but not make calls? I could have had two volunteers today instead of one if I had a link for that. Kind of related - is it ok to share our social media and/or Discord handle when making calls? I would like to connect with people I’m calling and volunteer together making it a more social / community experience especially when it’s older / tech savvy people. Thank you!

Content: I recommend inviting them to our Volunteer Welcome Zoom meetings, that way they can learn about all the opportunities available: https://events.democrats.org/event/671638/
