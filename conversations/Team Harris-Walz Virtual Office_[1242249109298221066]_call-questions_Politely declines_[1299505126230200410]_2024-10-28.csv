I’m wondering what to do if someone politely says they’re not interested and don’t hang up? Do I continue on to the next part of the script or just nicely thank them and hang up? Then do I hit the refuse button for the call or something else?

Thank you!"

So just double checking, don’t try to continue the conversation? I just thanked him for his time but wasn’t sure after if I should’ve pushed onto conversation since he was very nice"

Something like ""I know you are getting a lot of calls so thank you so much for even answering.  I'm calling from the  Harris Walz campaign and I appreciate your time"" or any variation!"
