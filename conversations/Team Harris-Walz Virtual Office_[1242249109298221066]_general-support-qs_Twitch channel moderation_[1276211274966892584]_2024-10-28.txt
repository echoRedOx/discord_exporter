Content: @staff is there someone moderating the  KamalaHarris Twitch channel? There is a bunch of spam happening in her channel even though it’s offline. The chat can be set to subscribers only or emotes only to prevent this. Just thought you should know. I moderate for several Twitch channels for women streamers so I’m familiar with a lot of the tools of you would like further suggestions.
