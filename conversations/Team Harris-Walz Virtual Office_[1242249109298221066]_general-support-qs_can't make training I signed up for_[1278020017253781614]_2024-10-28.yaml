  content: I signed up for part 2 of the online engagement training for tonight. That
    I can't make. Can I just sign up for a later date or switch it? Also how important
    is the part 2.  I already have reach and it seems fairly easy to use I have done
    the mapping on my own as well and have been sharing along on social media.
