Content: Hope I'm in the right place...when I click on the zoom link for 11:00 phone bank, it brings me to the zoom page and the dialog with "open link." but when i click that, it goes nowhere. I made sure to open zoom and sign in on  my account and tried again, but the same thing. any suggestions?

Content: hmm... trying to click around on my end and figure this out... if anything, I would try shutting down zoom completely and restarting it (+login) before clicking the link again.

Or it could be that the link is broken (I've done that by accident on the other end of phonebanks, oops.)
