Content: Thanks <@1072639754765615237>! It‚Äôs in Upper Marlboro, according to other posts. My mom and mother-in-law are so excited and had hoped to attend as we‚Äôve donated to the campaign and registered to canvass in Charles County on Aug. 24. My mother-in-law did phone bank work for Biden. Not sure how they‚Äôre selecting invitees, but it‚Äôd be wonderful to take my mothers who love Biden and want to see Kamala win.

I‚Äôm interested in setting up a virtual watch party and including my family in Wisconsin who are not consistent voters üôÇ It isn‚Äôt clear to me on the sign up - is the DNC projected on the call by you all or do I need to stream? Is there engagement like chat or people talking or is it like a stream like the DC call today? Thanks!

Content: I believe that it is up to you turn on the tv for the party guests in your home or to run your own zoom/Facetime/other with those who are joining remotely. You are welcome to sign up online. Then you join the proper Discord channel to chat with other hosts. There will be a brief training call on Zoom that you will be emailed about once you register through mobilize. Reminder: make it private if you don‚Äôt want randoms seeing your address or signing up.

Content: Just trying to figure out how to volunteer for door knocking. Live in Montgomery County MD and can maybe canvass PA or VA as needed. I just don‚Äôt see any option for how to sign up. Don‚Äôt find this platform very helpful as I am not a user and find the flood of options to explore on it a bit overwhelming. Call me old.

Content: Not that I‚Äôm aware of except her campaign is using the Empower app which enables you to text your own contacts about the campaign. They provide you with content that the app lets you send through your phone. They are doing a lot of canvassing and calling. I got the Empower app through her website.

Content: You use the QR code for your region in MD and download an app called Empower onto your phone. I haven‚Äôt used Reach, but I think some of the functionality is similar. You can use it to contact your friends and it lets you know about local events.

Content: Hey y'all!  Awesome a Maryland thread.  I'm T from MD.  Been making calls for Alsobrooks.  I am concerned that there have been no virtual events on Mobilize (that i have seen) to do any virtual calls or virtual textbanks for April McClain Delaney.  I receive email messages from her campaign stating how close the race between her and Republican Neil Parrot is for the House Seat.  I feel more online virtual events need to be done to get her elected! Now, that I think about it there's been no textbanking for Angela Alsobrooks either (but lots of phonebanks of which I've been taking part) What does everyone else think?  HarrisWalzLandslide!!  Let's go Maryland!

Content: I canvassed in Severna Park on Saturday for Angela Alsobrooks and a BOE candidate Dana S. I also wish there was texting, too. That's the easiest for me to do, but phone banking and canvassing are the most impactful so I see how they might just be focused on that.

Content: Well i saw events listed that Delaney is going to be at Montgomery College & Labor Day Parade I believe.  I'm talking specifically about textbanks/phone banks to voters for her.  I have to do virtual events.  I know there are events in person to door knock etc on her and Angela Alsobrooks behalf.  I'm just concerned about lack of virtual opportunities to support her for everyone who can't be at an in person gathering.  Also, Just saw email that Alsobrooks is tied w/ Hogan. Eeeek! üò¶  Does anyone know if there will be a debate b/t Delaney & parrot?  I know i read there will be b/t Hogan and Alsobrooks. i forget when. will have to check.

I did hear he is totally anti-choice& apparently extreme.  sigh.  Don't want him in the House! That seat needs to stay BLUE. And don't want Hogan in Senate.

Content: my dad pointed out there was an alsobrooks ad on tv last night. idk what station. so that's good.  I just got an invite from MD DEMS asking me to join the montgomery college rally. I msged the person back requesting they add virtual options for these rallies/speaking engagements for those who can't go out to events as well as adding textbanking for Delaney & phonebanking. they should do textbanking for Alsobrooks too! I hope he passes that request on. Mail in ballot voting will begin possibly 20th Sept- Oct 5th . maybe they are textbanking at in person locations or calling. idk. but there are none for supporters to do virtually for Delaney except one virtual phonebank I participated in & imo it was like Delaney was an afterthought as far as communicating it to voters. does anyone know when & how to watch Hogan alsobrooks debate & is there 1 for Delaney & Parrot.

Content: I looked at Bluevoter guide someone had shared a link to earlier today on here & the concept is very cool. but its missing the 2nd ballot  question on reducing  county exec terms.  at a recent meeting, some Dems seemed to say that was put on ballot by Republicans & to vote against the measure. if that is the case- they need to get the msg out to the public immediately. bc otherwise it's like oh term limits make sense look at supreme court etc. super impt that they inform Marylanders if they do want us to vote against that cuz 8 had no idea.

Content: There has been a lot of combined campaign canvassing events. There is usually at least one a week out of Crofton and multiple out of Annapolis. I haven't seen as many yard signs or anything like that which is unfortunate. I went canvassing back in early August and was surprised at how many people had never even heard of her. The Annapolis office just ramped up some phone banking events, they are almost daily for Harris and Alsobrooks.

How can we make this happen?

Content: I went door knocking for Alsobrooks in Baltimore City yesterday.  We encountered people who didn't know anything about the Senate campaign, but committed to voting for Alsobrooks after we spoke with them.  We left door hangers where people didn't answer.  These could help overcome Hogan's name recognition.   I'd encourage everyone to try to find some time to do this in your area.

Content: good! i am concerned there aren't enough textbanks to Maryland at all! and phonebanks. especialy for district 6. that Parrot is running for a congressional HOUSE seat that was held by Dem David Trone.  Delaney is running against him but i'm very concerned as there seem to be no phonebanks for her really.  and i don't see any national effort for phonebanks etc to MD. üò¶  they have redistricted 06 and lumped Dems in w a bunch of Republican voters!!

Content: I really object to them doing that. to me, that takes away MoCo county's voices b/c they split up the county and attached part of it to Western counties-Garrett, Allegany, Washington (and Frederick) but Frederick isn't so western. but the other 3-apparently pretty heavily republican as far as i've heard. So to split up MoCo and attached part of it to these Western MD counties isn't right, imo.

Content: Delaney‚Äôs district is always caught up in redistricting battles. For years, an awful older man (Tea Party, anti-ACA, reproductive rights, etc.) was our Congressman. The last I saw, Delaney is trailing behind! I don‚Äôt see a lot of Democratic resources for her, but I plan to start canvassing for both her and Alsobrooks on Saturday. We no longer have a local newspaper and there is little information about the Republican, Parrott. But I know from 2022 that he is quite extreme and will not be a friend to ordinary voters.

Content: yeah sadly that's my district & I'm none too pleased that it's suddenly a "competitive" district. Good job, <@1202478087753830430>  I've been getting emails from Delaneys campaign. Parrot is completely anti-abortion EVEN IN CASES OF RAPE OR INCEST.  He voted to WEAKEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS. I AM IN A VERY BLUE AREA. CANNOT BELIEVE AN EXTREME REPUBLICAN COULD REPRESENT US. AND IT'S A HOUSE SEAT TOO. I'm really not seeing any fundraising msgs or many digital virtual opportunities to call on her behalf & have seen no texting on her behalf. I can only do virtual, not in person.

Content: Thanks for your information. I am going to the Poolesville Day Parade on Saturday and then I‚Äôll go to learn canvassing in Frederick or Damascus. As I learn the talking points, I willing to canvass in the redder areas of the district. We are attached to much of western Maryland, which is aggravating. Her husband self-funded and got a fair amount of attention-but that was in a differently drawn district and when we still had local newspapers (not to be redundant, but it is such a problem to not have one during elections).

Content: Nothing fancy-their were many Gazettes: Gaithersburg & Germantown Gazettes were the ones that covered local news quite well. Local schools, politics and other news. We didn‚Äôt realize how much we depended on them for local election decisions until we were in the ballot booth with a lot of candidate choices and  realizing we had no information. ü§Ø

Content: afaik Hogan alsobrooks & delaney parrot are the close ones & I feel not enough attention has been paid. glad it seems within last couple days there has been some more effort at I guess a national level to do increased voter outreach to our state for Alsobrooks. But haven't seen much outreach for ppl to vote Delaney. which concerns me. no other MD races are close correct?  I haven't seen reporting of any.

Content: Graphic artists can apply to join the team called Kamala's Content Brigade. It has its own Discord server. This vetted group of volunteer graphic artists and video editors/animators makes some of the content you see here and in reach. There's a Google form to fill out/apply. Maybe ask in @general-support if you're interested.

Content: I spoke with the Maryland BoE last week which confirmed they would start mailing ballots imminently, but that it would take a while to mail the ballots to everyone who has already requested one because of the sheer volume. Mine was delivered by mail yesterday. They have already installed the 286 ballot drop boxes -- so people are voting now.

Content: Is it ok to share a campaign that we started over at Field Team 6 here?  Its a sticky note campaign to help share to voters, especially women, that their votes are private so they feel they can vote their convictions without their partner or family member knowing.  I'll wait to make sure its ok before sharing here.

Content: my dad says he's seeing a lot of anti Alsobrooks ads on tv. (I don't watch much TV these days but turn it on once in a while in the morning to see political ads haha. I am seeing a number against Hogan but also saw a couple against alsobrooks. I may try 2 keep an eye on which over the air shows what. like nbc has some against him. this morning my local ABC SINCLAIR affiliate had one against her. finally saw 1 against Hogan. have seen ZERO for Delaney at all & I don't think my dad has either.  but maybe they're targeting ads to more republican areas of the state? idk. I asked if he saw any for kamala. he said maybe a couple. ppl are voting here already mail in ballots. I wonder why barely any ads for harris? or...maybe targeting Republican areas...then again someone in neighborhood has parrot sign & previously had Trump sign so..

Content: Hey, Marylanders -- **Angela Alsobrooks'  Baltimore HQ reached out to me yesterday. They really need more canvassers leading up to Nov 5!**  If you live within a reasonable drive of Charm City, please find a time slot that works for you and come help get out the vote in this very Blue city!  

**Hogan treated Bmore shabbily and was never popular here -- he lost here in 2018 by a huge margin.**  Getting out the Bmore vote could make the difference in keeping the Senate blue!

Content: I sent this to several members of my network. Please be aware that this isn't visible through www.mobilize.us/mdvictory - and this is the link that goes out in MD Dems & the individual campaign emails & texts. That might have an impact on low sign-ups.

In 2016 Chris Van Hollen got 60%, in an election year filling a vacant seat. GOTV is how we do it!

Content: What's going on Maryland? Feeling good after that Ravens victory today. How are things looking for the Senate race across the state? Text banking has been going well for me with lots of positivity for Alsobrooks. Annapolis is definitely going for her which is great!

Content: I went ahead and voted the other day. but I am so appalled that there is no info on judges' views & they are in office for 10 to 15 years. I did my best to do due diligence and then I did my ballot. but there is a HUGE PROBLEM. there isn't info on county or circuit court judges'  views.  general info on them & their general answers to unimportant questions does nothing. it's NUTS. it's like a secret. I hope ppl who are on a position do something about this so voters can be informed.we as voters are not informed or provided with info in order to vote on judges! I found it utterly unacceptable.

Content: I wish they would do more drives out away from the campaign offices, or even tabling with signs to give away.  Germantown specifically may not be far from the Gaithersburg office, depending on where exactly people are, but there are definitely people nowhere close to offices who also aren't going to buy signs üòï

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!
