Content: Friends - I'm looking for a short list of time commitments typically required for canvassing, call banking, text banking, etc. I think being specific will help me rally friends to share the workload. Does that exist somewhere here or in Reach? Thanks!

Content: Hi Roxanne! I haven't seen a list but I'll check to see if such a thing exists or can be created. In the meantime, you can get a general idea by looking at the events and actions posted on events.democrats.org as most of those have start and end times. Hope that helps!

Content: Hi Roxanne, Online Engagement is very easy and flexible. The *training* is one hour, after that your friends do it on their own time, whenever they want. Call Banking is two hour group sessions, encourage your friends to sign up for one session, they will enjoy the vibe so much they'll want to come back for more.

Content: I just want to mention I've done phone banking. And we only do like 2 hours of shifts and that includes a debrief and a short training. Text banking would be when we have campaigns. So it depends.
