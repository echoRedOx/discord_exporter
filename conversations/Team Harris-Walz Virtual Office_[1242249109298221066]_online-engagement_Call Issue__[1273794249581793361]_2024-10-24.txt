Content: Hi <@1123079657856716901>. If you mean this event: DNC Watch Party Host Information Session, my calendar shows it starting at 9pm Eastern. I hope that helps!

Content: I just saw your response. Thank you for reaching out to me. ðŸ˜Š I was in the Women for Harris-Waltz Pre-Convention Call. It was scheduled for 8pm but I was still waiting for it to load. Both the YouTube live stream link and the Zoom call were delayed and once they loaded it was five-ten minutes until I had sound.

Is there another Party Host Information Session coming up? I missed the one last night but I'd like to host a watch party.
