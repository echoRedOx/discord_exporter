Content: Hello, I hope I tagged you okay? I am looking for help to figure out how to clear the red #2 by Kamala's picture on the left of my screen and the red "2 new mentions" at the bottom of my screen. I am very new (2 days) to Discord--and I just can't figure out what these actually mean and how to clear them out. Can you please help me? Or perhaps help me tag someone who can? Thank you in advance! üåä <:KamalaTanSuit:1275479319640150146> <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> üó≥Ô∏è üá∫üá≤ <:thankyou:1252806147396735057>

Content: Hi Robyn! Have you had a chance to watch Carolyn's intro to discord video? That's a great place to start for getting to know the platform. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA32MMsN61g
I'm happy to provide further assistance if you need it!

Content: Hi Benita. Are you able to log into Discord on another device, and do you have an active Discord account already? You would need to create one as it wouldn't be the same as your Reach app account.

Content: Sorry to try and confirm the obvious, but you are trying to use your Discord log in on your tablet, not your reach app log in information? They are not connected.

Content: Hi Benita, you can access Discord in your browser on your Surface Pro. Take care to use your Discord password instead of your Reach password.

Content: https://discord.com/ if you made your account with the same password as reach that is fine if it's easier for you to remember, just less secure than different passwords
