  content: I just got off a call with a woman in PA who told me that she is voting
    for Harris but is very annoyed that she is getting so many calls. She is afraid
    that it would turn off the undecided voters if they are getting the same amount
    of calls she is getting. Also, she asked to be taken off the list. How do I mark
    that?

  content: In future, you can let the person know that this will permanently remove
    them from our list but not other organizations. Many groups are calling and voters
    have to ask each group to remove them from their list.  If they just prefer to
    stop getting calls during this election, the best way to get off our list is to
    vote early.
