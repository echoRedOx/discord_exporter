I've canvassed locally many times...but don't we need people to reach out to voters (especially older voters) Face-to-Face in battle ground states?  I would be willing to travel to do so.

I found https://www.mobilize.us/ to be very helpful in finding ways to help in key states. You can filter by state, city, etc. I live in New York City but found ways to help in Pennsylvania."
