Content: I'm watching the Olympics on WNBC (broadcast from the top of the Empire State Building) and seeing lots of good ads for Kamala Harris: putting her face on during the Olympics, introducing her and the issues.  What amazes me is that the ads are being broadcast to NY/NJ/CT, which are surely 'blue' states.  Are there TV ads going out to swing states too?  If so, great.  I think it shows the resources the campaign has, and seeing them during the Olympics is perfect timing.

Content: Hi! I'm orginally from Burlington County and while I live in Bucks County, PA now, I'm proof that you can take the girl out of NJ but you can't take NJ out of the girl (I even still have my NJ accent). I actually moved where I'm like five minutes from a bridge to get back and I also graduated from Rider University (where my fellow Broncs at?). I want to see Kamala in office, I want to see Andy Kim joining Bob Casey in the Senate (also Fetterman since I worked on his campagin in 2022), and I want to see the district I live in now go blue!

Content: Hi all! I'm Chris from Bergen County.  This is the first time I've volunteered for a campaign, so this is all new to me. This election is too important to sit on the sidelines.  Look forward to working together to help elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz --- hopefully it will be a very big win to carry them to the White House.  As well as elect Andy Kim to the US Senate! üôÇ

Content: hey! atlantic county here. I had a MASSIVE issue last night with the LGBTQIA+ liaison for atlantic county. I reached out to them to volunteer and use my platform to get canadites infront of the online space (twitch streamer) and the first conversation with everyone went great. Then the liaison jumped in and was just absolutely unresponsive to the suggestions and explaintions I was giving about attracting more members. It ended with her telling me I was making fun of her and her "boomer" (her wods not mine) friends and that I dont care about the same things she does and I need to stop judging her. When the last email i sent was about how much i care about getting regulations into nursing homes and end of life care facilies. How much I talk about Alzhiemers and the funding for it. So i just feel really insulted and Bob was in the convo (chair down here) and he hasnt said anything and neither has anyone else so im kinda just assming that the DNC wants nothing to do with me

Content: i took a screen shot but i cant upload it here. I'm just really frustrated because when i talked to terri about all these meet up it sounded like yall were really excited to get some canidates infront of my streaming audience and now i feel like im just being ghosted by my own party. Just a "hey we read this, and we'll get back to you soon" would be great cause this has been going on since saturday.

Content: hey so i currently have over 1K for my watch party monday night, and more as the day goes on, and I've been trying to get ahold of my local democratic party but after talking with the lgbtqia+ causcus liaison to south jersey, i was belittled and demeaned in a way that i no longer wanted to be part of the lgbtqia+ causcus. No one else from the party has contacted me, regardless of emails, phone calls, text, or comments in the NJ channel. I really feel like im being ghosted by my party and I'm just trying to get nj canidates infront of my audience. any suggestions?

Content: I had orginally talked to the like main person who signed up volunteers and they were extremely excited to have me reach out because of how well i know content creation and stuff. so i guess im just confused a lot because i wanted to volunteer my time and screen and audience and its silent.

Content: I was hoping to just get a member of the party to sit down with me and talk to my audience about how to get involved at a local level, the different types of caucuses, how to set those up, the importance of primiaries. Plus like the canidates policies, why we should vote for them, things like that. Just a regular interview and hangout session  where people can get to know and trust people. Or i wanted to stream the grand opening of a new HQ but thats tomorrow and I still havent heard anything
I also wanted to interview the super delegate because i have no idea how that process works, and if i dont my followers sure dont, so i want those processes explained
and i did connect with the LGBTQ+ liaison but after explaining why i was reaching out and how i can help, she told me people only wanted a social club and until the youth show up we have no idea what they can offer. So i really didnt want to contune talking to someone that thought so little of younger voters. They also then told me I was judging them, making fun of them, and said it was because shes a "boomer" her words not mine. I can upload the emails but i just dont know what to do anymore

Content: okay so i stream on twitch, and like, im on screen so i wanted to get like commisioners at large and local school boards?
and they wanted me to stream the opening of the HQ, in person, and meet the super delegate there, in person.
a decent amount of my community is NJ local, or texas for some reason lol. but they never mentioned i would need creditials to do anything local
to be fair they didnt really mention anything other than how they cant get people to join the caucus and then telling me i was judging them.
also, this isnt a judgement on anyone, but like, i wish i knew about these things before now. I only found out about the discord because someone on tumblr mentioned it because i talked about my problem on there. The liaison even expressed that we dont probably vote for the same reasons as she's a senior citizen. And i did express that I talk about better nursing home and end of life care facility regulations. More funding and science for Alzhiemers. Reducing the deffense budget to help veterans. these are things i activily use my platform for and to be told I dont care about the same things as her was just frankly insulting. She mentioned that they would like me to help get more volunteers to join, but then started talking about how no one wants to show up because its not a social club or a bar. I recommened that maybe a gay night at a local club hosted by the caucus might be a really good idea. Especially if the canidate was there. Like in parks and rec. people love that level of connection.

Content: and this is just info dump at this point, but my mom was in hospic for a majority of my life, so i watch and heard about a lot of people dying while i sat there and did my home work either at the house with the patient or home. The elderly is something i VERY MUCH care about, because im very aware i will end up there with most likely a diagonoses for alzheimers. so it was just a massive slap in the face to hear her say i dont care.

Content: some are repsonses to people over in <#1250550849998946417> so if you would like to see what they said to make it all make sense please feel free. I cant upload screenshots here or that would have been easier. I reached out to the LGBTQIA+ Youth Causcus now and the regular DNC of south jersey, and its been radio silent. I called, ive texted, i reached back out to the original person, i honestly dont know how much more energy i can dump into this. I'm just trying to volunteer my platform, and this is just really rubbing me so wrong, and exhausting. Its been going on since saturday.

Content: random question unrelated to above topic: Does anyone know anyone whos in jersey and does like spray paint murals or stuff like that.  I have a wall outside my house (its mine, it supports the hill behind it lol) and I'm 200 yards from a polling place. Most people on election day park on my street. I was wondering if i could commission someone to deck it out for the Harris Walz Campaign and get a qoute and stuff on that. Any suggestions?

Content: I sent a bunch of texts to NJ-7 a few months ago with Field Team 6 for voter registration. People laugh when I tell them I'll text into NJ but I always tell them, "You can take the girl out of Jersey but you can't take Jersey out of the girl." (South Jersey born but I live in Bucks County, PA now)

Content: Yes- and nJ-7 is truly a competitive district. Sadly, my family was redistrcited out of 7, and they made it more red. But, it's an all hands on deck situation. I also have a home in PA-8 with Cartwright- which is a complete toss up, too!

Content: I'm responding to this not in official capacity for Harris Walz HQ and just as a vested Jersey constituent, but you should absolutely reach out to the constituency services representative for your state senator/assembly members about fixing your ANCHOR benefit stuff, they work very hard to get those correct for folks and will be happy to assist you!

Content: Jen and I usually work late night, and she knows more than I do, but my best guess from reading the form is that it involves transport for canvassers and other in person events, since it refers to having your own car.  Jen can reply with a better answer.  Thanks for your interest. <@155426778846855168>

Content: My mom is skeptical over Kamala but she's still voting for her because she understands that Trump would be way worse. I've tried to give her the same excitement that I have, but me being a thousand miles south means that I can't exactly show her clips of what Kamala is all about as easily

It seems to me we are not doing enough to win over the Latino vote and it feels like a shortcoming ‚Ä¶ this is an important and growing demographic that dems have been losing since Obama .

Content: On this day 4 years ago, a record 3.3 million Americans cast their ballot early.  And as expected, only 1.7 million early votes have been cast (a 45% decrease).  Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/

Content: Hi. I need to get this out of my head. Send supportive reacts if you got ‚Äòem. üíú

So we are out canvassing today and something really weird is going on in our township. 

I don‚Äôt know who got to these folks but we have been finding, over and over again today, self-identified South Asian families here repeating this same bizarre not logical line (a talking point spoon fed to them somehow??) that VP Harris is ‚Äúfocusing too much on her blackness,‚Äù therefore they are voting Dem locally but will be voting Republican nationally.

üò≥

Lemme get this straight, they say she isn‚Äôt focusing enough on being South Asian‚Ä¶ sooooo let‚Äôs vote for *the guy who hates South Asians*????

Doing our best to steer them back on track. But also wow üò®

Thank you for hearing me out. Really looking forward to more texting today because this repeat experience today has been disheartening. Glad to see folks here keeping at it! Steady on, everyone. üíúüíúüíú

Content: That's very curious if you're hearing the same thing. I'm of South Asian heritage, but from the west indies. We are both fiercely supportive of our own. But we often also fall prey to colorism.

Content: My guess is a lot of this fear will be assuaged once they see Kamala and the Whitehouse do their Divali celebrations. (I'm hoping it's big and bright and promoted everywhere!) Personally, I love Divali. And it will reach the hearts of every south Asian and west Indian hopefully.

Content: <@391802910217863168>  I'll repeat something my sister warned me about years ago now. She lives overseas, but always kept in touch with local (Bergen County) issues. She related to me how she watched the local Republicans repeatedly use a 'playbook', so to speak -- i.e. the precise same thing as Gov. Walz describes in his  video about Project 2025 -- it is indeed a playbook. Just at a local, not national scale.

My sister said to me that she witnessed multiple local Republicans all repeat the precise same talking points on various local issues, on multiple occasions, in order to dominate the discussion. Republicans seem (?) better at this type of coordination.

It is only logical once thought over - of course local playbooks have been created all over the map, by both 'sides' (understand that I am a fierce Independent; we tend to field our own small teams ü´† Not this time though... üòê)

I have also only recently returned to NJ, having spent years in the wilds of Pennsylvania, surrounded by Trump supporters. By virtue of my precarious balance in the middle, and by evil happenstance, most of my friends are now ex or, at best, friends at an extreme distance. I have personally witnessed the most unbelievable issues (!) be brought forth as a 'reasonable' topic for conversation. Over and over and over again. Ad nauseum, until the friendships would dissolve into a gooey cult 'ghoulash soup'. (sic)

What I mean to say by all this is that they have a weapon in their 'arsenal' that we cannot really match. You might imagine that I say that with distress, when in actuality I say it with a concerned form of relief. Because it is the Republican base's willingness to embrace insanity, in order to 'win'.

In my view confronting the insanity directly is completely pointless-- they will simply sidestep the issue even in their own minds. Our father was a psychologist until he switched to mathematics. He would have had a field day studying all this. :/

Content: http://youtube.com/post/UgkxUqU8ZtpcNFfKabL8GzJtoOV0Mio6pFQm?si=Hu8rtOCHwKliqyXa also let them know she was raised by her mother and always talks about her and their lives together. There is no trying to show one side more than the other. Like another responder said colorism is real. And they‚Äôre doing the same playbook in other areas against Harris. In Jewish areas they‚Äôre saying she‚Äôs antisemitic and pro Palestine. In Muslim areas like in Dearborn Michigan they‚Äôre saying she‚Äôs anti Palestine and Gaza and saying she‚Äôs pro Zionist. It‚Äôs part of the same tactics. Thank you for being on the ground and helping. I wish I could do more.

Content: I have said the same thing. Where are the notable psychologists?  They must be having a field day studying all of this. From how things started to emerge and connect on the Internet, then social media, and now to the viral nature that it has become. I have also had to distance myself or cut people completely off because of the same thing you described. They‚Äôre all in on lying and manipulating at all cost just to win. They will totally flip everything. He‚Äôs been able to bring together a coalition of all the lowest energy people, that already have these fears and predisposed to the manipulation and is not afraid to take advantage of it by telling all these people what they want to hear no matter how disturbing or contradicting. He just wants to get them all to vote by stoking the fear, hate, and whatever else they know will motivate someone to think that the future will be better. There is no low they won‚Äôt stoop to.

Content: <@408455294570463242>  The worst part about all of this is that they are now beginning lying  *to themselves*.  I had an extremely disturbing conversation recently, on issues tangentially related to the election / country's direction.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: I agree wholeheartedly.  I think that the Democrats could counter that with a civics lottery styled in the same fashion -- but use his wealth against him by pointedly helping the winners (who could win, say, a spot at a rally) pick a suitable *charity*  I hate the idea that all of this illicit cash can effectively buy states. It is grotesque.

Content: I agree, their monetary advantage has to be something Kamala uses against them‚Äîall the nasty ads, it‚Äôs billionaires trying to buy the election; lies and bribes, as another phrase to use. Plus, if they have to lie about Democrats, it means they have nothing good to say about themselves, and there‚Äôs nothing bad to say about Democrats.

Content: To answer this specific question, it depends on what the person answering says. It could be a wrong number, the person you are looking for might not be available (busy/call back) or it could be that the person who answers can hand the phone to the person you are looking for.

Content: Hi <@1270895729610723413> - we LOVE hearing about early voting lines, but unfortunately, there are some states that don't allow photos within 75 feet of a polling place, so we have to remove the photos. Sorry about that!

When you get there, go up to the second floor and there will be signs that say ‚ÄúHarris Walz‚Äù. I forgot the exact suite number, but once you get up to the second floor, you will see the signs.
