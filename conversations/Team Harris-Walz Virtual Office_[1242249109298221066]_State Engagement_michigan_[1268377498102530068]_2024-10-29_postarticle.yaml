    District 10 [just north of Detroit] is where Dem Carl Marlinga is running. Unable
    to attach a district map here for you. Michigan Demcast has a list of MI House
    races they think will be closest based on the last election. With the Michigan
    One Campaign, you will be able to work simultaneously for House, Senate & Presidential

  content: Drove 90 minutes from out of state to knock for Kamala in Michigan. We
    were instructed by the Berrien Dems to knock for state level Michigan candidates.
    Initially, no Kamala materials were provided in this must win swing state. We
    pushed the issue and they found some Kamala materials. Lots of Trump flags in
    this traditionally blue area St Joseph. Harris Walz needs to get in touch with
    Berrien county Democrats. Every canvasser should've been given Harris Walz materials
    without asking. This is happening in Indiana as well. The down ballot candidates
    only care about their own races. I had collateral for 14 different Michigan people
    that were not Harris Walz.

    for this question, the dates should be posted by the Secretary of State Site For
    MI.  The excerpt in the screen shot comes from https://www.michigan.gov/sos/elections/voting/early-in-person-voting#WhenCanIVote.
    If your friend lives in a community with additional days of early voting, they
    can find out using this site to look up their registration. https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/index.  Thank
    you.

  content: Hi Michigan people. I've just been working over with the text team, and
    talking to a very nice guy named Rickey (who presumably lives in the area of the
    Bernie Sanders event) - who was most adamant that we need to print up more yard
    signs and send them out there ASAP. I thanked him (and directed him to the official
    KH shop, of course) and promised that I'd pass that suggestion along.

  content: 'Hi Anne - That''s terrific!! I suggest focusing on the close U.S. House
    races we need to win to regain the House: District 07 [several counties near Lansing]
    is the one Elissa Slotkin is leaving for her Senate run.   Here is a sign up for
    door knocking in that district    https://www.mobilize.us/onecampaignformichigan/event/632227/    District
    08 [Bay City area] is open because Dan Kildee is retiring. District 10 [just north
    of Detroit] is where Dem Carl Marlinga is running. With the Michigan One Campaign,
    you will be able to work simultaneously for state, House, Senate & Presidential
    races. Here are other events https://www.mobilize.us/onecampaignformichigan/?country=US&event_type=1&state=MI'

  content: Hi. You guys have been very helpful so far. I am coming to Michigan to
    volunteer from the 22-27 and still having a hard time figuring out where I can
    be most useful door knocking. I'm thinking of District 07 and wondering if anyone
    knows if there is a campaign office that I can go to get my walking lists?  I
    only see one time slot from 5-7 on Wednesday to help Hertel or a big Campaign
    for Michigan office in Lansing or around there.  I'd really like a home base campaign
    office since I'll be there for multiple days.  I realize that might be such a
    2016 thought since it seems like the campaigns are set up differently now.  Also
    since I'm looking for ways to help during the day on weekdays, there doesn't seem
    to be as much set up.

    rejected gets cured. Here is the notice by Jake Halpin:          "For those that
    I haven''t been able to introduce myself to yet, my name is Jake Halpin, the Harris
    for President Campaign''s Deputy for Ballot Cure here in Michigan. Together with
    each of you, my team is working to build the largest Ballot Cure operation Michigan
    has ever seen to make sure the 10,000+ Democratic ballots we project to be rejected
    in Michigan this cycle are counted for Kamala Harris.

    We are officially launching an on the ground Ballot Rescue Program to launch on-the-ground
    volunteers across Michigan to notify and help cure voters. This is an operation
    without precedent here in Michigan and we''re counting on volunteers across the
    state to step up in the last 17 days of curing to help us win Michigan for Kamala
    Harris.


    Data shows Ballot Rescue door knocking is by far the MOST EFFECTIVE form of voter
    outreach -- if you''ve got extra effort left to give, this is what to give it
    to. Here is the form for MI residents wh o are intrested in helpingto fill out:

  content: Good news everyone!!  By flipping the legislature blue, Michigan was able
    to pass a law making vote counting faster!!!  And today is the first day of ballot
    processing!!  32% of the total 2020 turnout has already voted, with a total ballot
    return rate of about 61%!  If you can, please go out and vote early, or if you
    are voting absentee, please deliver your ballot yourself to avoid delays.  Don't
    take your foot off the gas!

  content: 'Hey folks, Chicagoan here.  BLUF: Where should I take my friends to canvass
    this weekend (both days)? I.e. who needs our help the most?


    Long story long: we''ve canvassed for local candidates in Chicago, as well as
    in Kenosha and Racine, WI for big democrat the past couple of weekends. We can
    drive as far as Kalamazoo or Battle Creek Michigan, or anything in that range
    into Michigan or Wisconsin. This weekend we were redirected from Kenosha to Racine
    because they had enough volunteers there, which got me thinking there might be
    places a bit further in that need us more.  If you know a county in need of help
    whose office I should reach out to let me know and I''ll give them a holler.'

    Detroit (Livernois) and Ann Arbor! If anyone wants advice of where to go, reach
