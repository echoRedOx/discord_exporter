I do not and have never had another discord with this number or any number. Therefore I can not follow the directions that guide me to log into my old account and remove the phone number. I submitted a ticket to Discord but don't know what else to do and do not want to be unable to continue in this server

This is a huge problem with this number verification process not just here but on other platforms.

I appreciate the help but I've been back and forth with Discord with days and they are not helpful as it is just a bot sending automated suggestions.

Pretty sure it’s the people who stole my identity during covid

Every time I do that I have to redo my password just incase they are trying to get access to this account

I entered my mobile number instead of my email and then clicked on ""forgot password"". I don't remember the exact order of the steps. I do remember that I received a text with a 6 digit code to enter into my computer. And I received instructions to create a new password. That got me into this old account that I had completely forgotten about. I then went to settings, my account, account removal, and deleted the old one. It seems to take a few hours or maybe a day before the account is deleted. After that the phone number should be freed up for use in your current discord account."
