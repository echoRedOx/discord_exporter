  content: 'Good afternoon,


    I signed up for the 4pm Phone Bank, and ran into the following ZOOM login message/error
    on multiple devices, two different computers and iphone, over about a 30 minute
    period of checking from around 3:45 to 4:15pm.


    "The host requires authentication on commercial Zoom platform to join this meeting.
    Please sign in with a commercial zoom account to join."


    Will sign up for more phone banks in the future, but wanted to share in case any
    other callers run into this issue.'

  content: Im sorry <@1278039047184322710> , the breakout room for debriefs is a new
    procedure we are trying out so everyone can debrief and no one has to get skipped
    out on. Please bare with us as we also try and get used to this new format. We
    just want to make sure everyone feels heard and not skipped out on!
