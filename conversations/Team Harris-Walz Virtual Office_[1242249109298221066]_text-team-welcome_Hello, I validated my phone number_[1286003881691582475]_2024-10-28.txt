Content: Hi Sonja- Thanks for checking in. Some of the campaigns are replies only, FYI. If you are having difficulties with STW, please post in general-support-qs. Watch the texting campaigns channel for links and try to get into one as soon as it's posted. Thanks for being here!

Content: Prior to Sept 16 I never had any problems with grey tabs. If I was not in the system because of the phone number not being validated correctly, then the system wouldn't let me in at all, correct? And thx for helping! ðŸ’™

Content: They started with some campaigns that are now reply only on September 16 also. Maybe that's what happened? They just posted replies in texting campaigns. What happens if you click on one of those?

Content: It was for me also when I checked. Please keep trying when new reply campaigns are posted. If it's still not working, ask in general-support-qs. Thanks for your persistence!
