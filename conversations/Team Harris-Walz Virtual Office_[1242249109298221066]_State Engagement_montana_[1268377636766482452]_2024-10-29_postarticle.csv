You can check your registration status at https://iwillvote.com/, and get the form to register by mail, but YOUR APPLICATION TO REGISTER MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 7TH TO COUNT. Bring it to a post office. Ask (politely) to watch them postmark it if you try to mail it Monday. 

You can also check your registration status and download the forms you need to register at Montana Secretary of State  Christi Jacobsen's official page, https://votemt.gov/ Same due date applies. 

 IF YOU MISS THE MONDAY DEADLINE, YOU CAN STILL OFFICIALLY REGISTER AT ANY OF THE STATE'S 56 COUNTY ELECTION OFFICES UNTIL NOON THE DAY BEFORE ELECTION DAY (you can also register on election day, but maybe don't push your luck)
Here is a link to the addresses of all 56 Election Offices from Ms. Jacobsen's office: https://sosmt.gov/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?juwpfisadmin=false&action=wpfd&task=file.download&wpfd_category_id=23&wpfd_file_id=65879

Oh  wait, no it is not. These are the addresses to mail your applications in to. Most of them are PO boxes. It looks like most bigger towns have addresses for actual offices where you can pick up and drop off your registration in person - Helena has one, Missoula, Butte, even my birthplace Shelby is showing off their big Toole energy with a real office, not just a PO box. But if you're somewhere off in the boonies like Scobey or Billings or Great Falls, you might want to fill out an application TODAY and  hit the post office first thing in the morning tomorrow."

A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.
