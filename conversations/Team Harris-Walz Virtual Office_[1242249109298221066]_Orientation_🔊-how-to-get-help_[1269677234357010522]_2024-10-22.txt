Content: 9. <@&1242251718100779089> : These are folks who work either for the DNC or the campaign directly, and are **in charge **of the various programs on the server. Their names are in a teal color, and they have a little 'D' symbol next to their name. They are the last word and **chief authority** in the server, so please do not hesitate to ping them if there is a major issue or there is something that our moderators cannot help you with.
