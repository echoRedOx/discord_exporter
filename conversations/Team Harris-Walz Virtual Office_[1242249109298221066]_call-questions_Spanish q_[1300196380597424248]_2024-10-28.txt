Content: Hi all, if we had a successful conversation in spanish but also want to mark the voter as such for any future calls - is there a way to do both of those things? I was able to confirm that they are voting for Harris. Seemed so based on searches here but wanted to check. Thank you!

Content: Since the call was successful just mark it that way and in the future if he gets a call from someone who doesnt speak spanish then it can be marked that way
