If you like engaging in conversation, directing folks in the right direction, answering questions, and you have a comfortable grasp of Discord, the Call Mods team could use your help. Let me see about connecting you with someone on the Staff within the Calls Team. As for the VOTE Team and opportunities to be a Data / Chat Captain, you can sign up for your preferred training using the links above. We are excited to have you on the team!"
