Content: Hi! Does anyone know of printable cards showing Harris' policies and plans compared with Trumps?  This organization https://www.bigwin2024.com/card-1 created them for Biden but they haven't updated them for Harris.  Curious if the Dems have anything like this as I think it would be really effective to be able to hand out these fact cards.  Thanks!
