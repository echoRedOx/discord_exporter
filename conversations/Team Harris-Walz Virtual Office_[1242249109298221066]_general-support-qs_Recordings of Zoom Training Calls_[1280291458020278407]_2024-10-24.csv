Sometimes schedules are not convenient for people. Wouldn't it be easier to offer a recorded training session for volunteers who can't make the designated times? Also, it would make it possible to offer fewer time options since volunteers could watch the training on their own at any time. Also, there is training where I would want to fast forward through parts that I already know. On some topics I know well (such as tonight's training on disinformation in online engagments) where I would like to skim through the parts I already know. Thanks in adavnce for your reply."

It’s important for many of the trainings to have the “in person” aspect to allow for support and questions during the session, and the information discussed during these sessions may evolve relatively quickly as well, which probably makes recordings obsolete pretty quickly. Hope to see you on some of the trainings soon when you can make it!"

We do try to provide trainings at a variety of times to align with the availability of our diverse group of volunteers."
