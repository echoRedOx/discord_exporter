but my strategy is just to troll the 2024 NV Victory mobilize generally! You can filter by date based on when you'll be there: https://www.mobilize.us/2024nvvictory/

Content: Great! I am going to try schedule time to work remotely from NV some time in the next 4-6 weeks. I'l reach out to folks here when I have a better idea of the days so I can maximize my efforts. I'm hoping to help with voter registration and more group activities - it's always more joyful (for me) that way. I've canvassed in past elections and it always felt difficult/lonely/stressful knocking on doors by myself.

Content: There's a Zoom call on Sept. 25, 5pm PST with Edgar Pando, Director of Nevada Voter Protection, on how to get involved in voter protection this cycle. "He will be giving an overview of their voter protection efforts in Nevada and the challenges they are facing especially in the Reno area."  I got this info from the Agenda 4 Democracy e-newsletter‚Äîthat group is doing a lot of work on CA and NV races up and down the ballot: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcJ3C9kCAc-38O0JJv5uN3NtLCA0u9nQvhoOZJgRLoeLJvPg/viewform.

Content: I'm a CA resident that is interested in moving to NV for the final month of the campaign to help organize. I can pay my own way to get to wherever I will be most helpful to the campaign, but I was hoping there might be another volunteer or member of the campaign that has a spare room that I could stay at while I volunteer. Please let me know (in DMs) if anyone can help connect me with the right person!

Content: On this day 4 years ago, a record 3.3 million Americans cast their ballot early.  And as expected, only 1.7 million early votes have been cast (a 45% decrease).  Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/

Content: Hi, I got an email with a free room in Vegas offer. So I booked a trip for 4 nights next week and plan to do knocking on doors for 4-5 days. Should I coordinate with anyone there in advance or just sign up for some shifts on mobilize.us and meet people there?

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!

Content: Thanks!! I'm a California resident but am involved with GOTV for Nevada so it's helpful to understand NV law.  

From my reading of these NV web pages, residents can register and vote on the same day, if done in person at a polling location.  Can that be done during Early Voting and on Election Day or just on Election Day?

Content: <@&1245910626241351811> Early voting has started in many of the swing states, so this weekend is CRITICAL to our GOTV efforts. It's also incredibly important that we make sure that people with mail in ballots have gotten their ballots and understand how to return them. This is such important work, and we have to close strong. But we can't make our 10 million call goal without your help. If you're experienced, you can go straight to our dialer [here ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=933f666e-c699-46e3-ac92-12d9cf6f3992) - if you're new, please join us over in <#1242256751445934262> to get connected to some training! (If you don't have that, go to  <id:customize>  and choose "talk to voters in key states.") Even making a few calls helps. Many hands make light work. Will you please come over and join us?
