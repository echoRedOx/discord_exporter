It showed range percentages of women voters in all the states from the last election. High levels: MI, WI PA, GA.  Lowest levels of women voters were in southern states. Lots of boosts and interest."

And I belong to the MI Women for Harris-Walz FB group. Over the last month+ there has been a lot of posts by women in “red areas” of the state with fear about posting H-W signs in their yards. So a lot of creative alternatives have been discussed to show support. And women like me in “blue areas” show support, lean an ear and encourage confidence and resolve to support H-W. One of the very creative and brilliant idea that has come out of this group are post-its to encourage women in red areas to vote their heart. Now one innovation woman has had them printed. Ladies have been placing them on stall doors in women’s room."
