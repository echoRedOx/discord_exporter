 I just finished my first phone bank shift and really enjoyed it! Iâ€™d like to do it more and saw some mentions about an anytime calling group. 

1) Do I need to complete a separate training to participate in the anytime calling group? 

2) If not, is there a link I could use to log onto the dialer whenever I have a few spare minutes?

Thanks for all yâ€™all do! Feels awesome to actually get involved and Iâ€™m excited to do more â—¡Ìˆ"

(Though Iâ€™m sure some of the basics are the same!). It appears that that training will then allow you to schedule calls outside of the block window calls. And thank YOU for what youâ€™re doing too!
