My main & bigger following is on Twitter/X. My connections are there. Unfortunately it's hard to get traction because of Elon Musk lately. I don't have the huge account on my other platforms therfore my message doesn't spread like it does on Twitter/X. How should I go about spreading it further out on other platforms?"

I could be wrong (I'm in several training & zooms) I also work on dives/campaigns. Hard to keep track lol. I'll sign up for the Saturday one. Thank you!"

I spend time in <#1260333091319451660> .  It seems some users can see Community Notes (CNâ€™s) at the regular tweet link & others do not, like myself.  It was recommended by another user & I re-posted the use of //x.com/i/birdwatch/t/ along w/the tweet ID added to the end to see CNâ€™s.  Should we encourage those who create CN's, when possible, to post both the original tweet link & the birdwatch recommendation and/or link?

When directed to CNâ€™s, I often see several CNâ€™s posted.  Even though I read all CNâ€™s and use my own discretion as to which ones are helpful or not.  Should we encourage CN creators to somehow highlight (screenshot or repeat - cut/paste) their content so we know which ones are coming from them?  It would save time not having to vote on multiple CN's and focus on the ones coming from this community, not to mention it would increase thier ""helpful"" numbers if the other CN's from random contributors recieved less votes.

I have been voting on CNâ€™s for a little bit now.  Is there any follow up when a CN gets approved and becomes visible?  I am starting to feel like my efforts are not making an impact.

Iâ€™ve seen users who are also replying to tweets along w/voting on or creating CNâ€™s.  Should it be recommended to post links to those replies as they can get buried and hard to find amongst the many replies?  It would make it easier to support those efforts.  Should it be encouraged that anyone replying to tweets do the same and if so, where should they post that as it wouldn't actually be a CN?

Lastly, I may have missed some follow up but there may have been some efforts made on behalf of the communities needs here:
