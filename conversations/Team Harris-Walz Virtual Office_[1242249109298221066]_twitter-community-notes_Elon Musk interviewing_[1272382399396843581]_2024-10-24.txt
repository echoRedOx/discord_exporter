Content: Hi -- Here is a message I just posted to the twitter-community-notes group. Am open to your ideas --Dan Hi  - Thanks for bringing up the Musk-Trump conversation. I am resending below my message on this topic. I am attaching information on several areas they might talk about and post: DEI, anti-Trans etc. Some statements are already in CN form. Please message everyone if you use any, so we don't duplicate. I will be focusing on various aspects of immigration, which are not in the attached document. I doubt CNs can work on lifestream and we'll need to look for posting within minutes of a statement. I heard Trump was not actually back on X --- Dan                         Hi Folks - Elon Musk will be interviewing Donald Trump tomorrow evening [Monday} at 8 ET/5 PT on X-Twitter. I will look in real-time for video clips on Elon's account, RNC Research, MAGA War Room & others. For responding, I am preparing or recycling community notes in areas where Musk & Trump align in bashing: trans rights, DEI, immigrants, mainstream media, etc. I will post draft community notes in a document here before the interview. I can only post one CN a day so you are welcome to borrow some of mine if you want to join in this effort. I'll focus on responses to immigration falsehoods.  Elon has 190 million followers so this could be bigger than most TV events

Content: <@908884987481317406> <@1250135789845741626> According to [article](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/elon-musk-misleading-election-claims-x-views-report-rcna165599), researchers "identified 50 instances this year when Musk posted election claims that have been debunked by independent fact-checkers but spread widely on the app anyway. None of the 50 posts by Musk displayed a 'Community Note' to correct his claims or add context, calling into question the effectiveness of Xâ€™s user-driven fact-checking system".

Content: Thanks for this article. I've often wondered if Musk would allow a community note on one of his posts. Last week he did ask community note contributors if something was valid. One of his supporters who responded now has a CN attached to his post -- one that I helped promote. I am focusing now on commenting on  https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom and https://x.com/RNCResearch  which have clips of the conversation. I can only do one CN a day and will do one on their falsehoods about crime and immigration
