  content: 'I do not know for certain.  If I was trying to make that outcome (in-person
    door-knocking/canvasing outside of planned events) I''d show up to 1-2 of the
    scheduled ones and talk to organizers.  They likely will have extra lists and
    timing flexibility for a proven volunteer.  I''ve seen that realized a bunch of
    times.    For example:  Think about the most simple case of: other volunteers
    at the big event not finishing their zones and there''s some additional coverage
    to be done to complete them.   Also realize that not every person organizing volunteers
    are highly connected in the area, many are chipping in like all of us, but with
    activity you end up more likely to connect with folks.


    I''d go do some organized events, be successful/figure-out-if-you-like-it, and
    then ask around about more.'
