I feel like Harris needs to speak to both Palestinians and Jews and give a more detailed response regarding what  to do if Netanyahu or Hamas don't agree to a ceasefire. Also, many of the pro-Palestine protestors don't realize that Hamas is also ruining Gaza as well. Many people in Gaza want Hamas to disappear.
