  content: Hi There, I'm a phone bank coach for the last few years with The Bay Area
    Coalition(Virtual Phone banks) and I am also coaching at the Dem HQ in San Francisco.  I
    would like to make calls from home outside my coaching shifts.  Do I need to do
    the Anytime Call Training?  They seem to be using Slack...

  content: Hi Sandy! We here on the Discord calls team have a program separate from
    Slack, but you can indeed do calls anytime from 9am until midnight ET! Just [sign
    up here](https://events.democrats.org/event/704955/ ) for immediate access to
    the dialer, and then fill out your [debrief form](https://forms.gle/cJohAPgrSRH7S25Y7)
    afterwards. And here is our [training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FYlZK0essc)
    if you need it!
