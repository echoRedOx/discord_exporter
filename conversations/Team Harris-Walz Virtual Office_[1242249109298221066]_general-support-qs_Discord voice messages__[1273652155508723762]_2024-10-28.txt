Content: I keep seeing this alert that I have a voicemail-like message, but when I click on it ... nothing happens? When I go to my DMs, I also don't see anything there.

Content: Seconding this: I can see James sitting in a voice channel without the channel/category listing.  This looks like it might be a bug, but might be fixable depending on how the server's hidden voice channels permissions are set up.

Content: Please Ignore it. It's a staff member doing something, not a bug.
