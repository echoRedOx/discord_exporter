For content with a lot of text, it is pretty cumbersome to reproduce all of the info by-hand in alt text, especially from mobile. Does Reach provide alt-text for it's content somewhere?

If not, can this be added as a feature? I try to ensure my posted content is accessible, which increases reach and is pretty vital on platforms like Bluesky which have strong norms around including alt-text."

I responded and upvoted. I hope everybody else up votes. This is an important issue. Blind people and others who rely on assistive technology cannot access images without alt  text
