Content: I just got off a call with a woman in PA who told me that she is voting for Harris but is very annoyed that she is getting so many calls. She is afraid that it would turn off the undecided voters if they are getting the same amount of calls she is getting. Also, she asked to be taken off the list. How do I mark that?

Content: In future, you can let the person know that this will permanently remove them from our list but not other organizations. Many groups are calling and voters have to ask each group to remove them from their list.  If they just prefer to stop getting calls during this election, the best way to get off our list is to vote early.
