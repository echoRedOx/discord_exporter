  content: "Hi! I was wondering if there are any ways for an individual to raise money\
    \ for the campaign? I know you can\u2019t donate *for* someone else, but I haven\u2019\
    t been able to find any rules and regulations regarding individual fundraising,\
    \ whether it\u2019s through a shop where the proceeds go to the campaign or through\
    \ a fundraiser. I\u2019m trying to explore all my options for helping. \U0001F642\
    \ I haven\u2019t read through the entire server yet, so I figured I\u2019d ask\
    \ in case I missed the info somewhere or haven\u2019t found it yet."

  content: Hello <@1190850265981657178> thank you for asking this question and it's
    great that you are interested in fundraising. One of the ways you can incorporate
    fundraising into your efforts is with hosting events. The events can be virtual
    or in-person, they can happen once or in a series and I believe the can be on-going.
    You can set up your event with https://events.democrats.org/host/ and then connect
    ActBlue to have your donors funds go directly to the campaign. Also check with
    the https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1242264464246440017 team,
    they may have more ideas. If you can't see that link, go to Channels & Roles at
    the top of your menu and select the Host Events option.
