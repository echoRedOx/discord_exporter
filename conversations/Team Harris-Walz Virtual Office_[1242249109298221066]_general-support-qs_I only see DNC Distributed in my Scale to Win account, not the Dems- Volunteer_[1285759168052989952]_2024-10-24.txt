Content: Hi <@757745709431914576> I will help you get to the person who can answer this. You can click on Channels & Roles near the top of the left menu. Then pick Text Voters In Key States, this will open up the text team welcome channel and you can ask there. Here is the direct link to [Text Team Welcome](https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1266829704204386334), this link will work after you pick Text Voters In Key States.
