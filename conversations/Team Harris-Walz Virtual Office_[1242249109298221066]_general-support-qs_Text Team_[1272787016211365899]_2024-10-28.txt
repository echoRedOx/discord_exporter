Content: Hi <@1272782925649416300> and <@782870341445353522> Thanks so much for your interest in the Text Team! Yes, we are currently at capacity for our trainings/onboarding new texters. You can keep an eye on this link https://events.democrats.org/event/654680/ if we have more trainings open up, or sometimes there‚Äôs a spot that opens up last minute because someone cancelled their slot.

Content: The text team is doing a great job, I get upwards of 6 a day.  How do I reduce the number?  Is everyone PAC pulling from the same database?  If I reply stop to one will it stop all of them?

Content: So you're likely getting donation texts as well. We don't send out those donation texts. The only texts we send out is about like upcoming events or volunteer recruitment or like voting when it's time to vote. And some others.
