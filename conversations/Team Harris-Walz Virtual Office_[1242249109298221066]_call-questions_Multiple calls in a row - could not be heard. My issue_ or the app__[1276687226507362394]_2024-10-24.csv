Called several people today, had some good talks some hang ups... but recently a lot of my calls have gone 'unheard'. Even had someone say ""I'm on a national do not call list"" but I couldn't even be heard!"

You can connect to the dialer on the larger device and then use your phone for audio.

If you pick the second, it will walk you through connecting your phone to the dialer ðŸ™‚"

But check in tomorrow - there are lots of Mods with more expertiese than me on this one ðŸ™‚

You could call from a land line, it wouldn't matter so long as your using scale to win on the computer. Sometimes I also have issues where they can't hear me. Sometimes they are faking it and the reason I know that is because I learned some tricks. If it happens more than 3x in a row, just disconnect your phone (hang up) and restart the session."
