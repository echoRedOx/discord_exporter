Content: Hey everybody.  I'm kind of intermittent at the moment as I recovering from a long illness.  I am an online engagement team member. I am very interested in disinformation, trolling and malign information campaigns, especially on Twitter.   I am a social scientist who has been studying malign information and social behavior for a couple of decades.  The problem of what to do about those campaigns is currently very much an "art" as much as a science.  I should be around more now. My plan is to work mostly on weekends and occasional evenings after word.

Content: Hi Hi! Hi! My friend's mom is working with https://www.vopropros.com/ - they reach out to people who have voted Dem in the past but are inactive. She is doing a lot of work in Pennsylvania because there are some senate seats that are flippable. Like https://www.ehaszforcongress.com/. There are several races in NC that are also flippable, my friend is leading the efforts at https://sites.google.com/view/neverandnow-co/home. Do you know which are the critical races around Richmond?  I would suggest keeping an eye on the welcome chat and the  PA, VA, WV and NC chats. So you can welcome anyone from the region as they come on and share any information you are getting from your social media or otherwise. Introduce people who are doing similar work to each other and help them connect either by interest or region.

Content: The <#1242249109298221069> channel has daily training opportunities for how to support various efforts for the Presidential campaign. You should take your lead from that channel on any national election efforts. My social media approach has been trying the following. I stopped following any distractions, I'm currently only following people who I love to see succeed and those who lift me up. My first post was an honest video of myself letting folks know where I am emotionally and why it is important to me that I give this campaign my all. I use the posts from influencers I listen to with a supper short comment that connect the issue to future consequences and Kamala's  agenda and or qualifications. I dont know how to add pictures here so if you want to see an example you can see it on my instagram. thats the only platform i kinda know how to use so thats what im focusing on. t.mf.aidanator is my handle. its public so you dont have to follow me to see it.

Content: Now im balancing that by sharing the funny stories that my friends send me via inbox. This achieves two things: my friends feel seen and I add some levity to the daily narrative. Im literally just copying the model that the DNC used.

Content: Hello fellow Virginians!  I live in Falls Church and am hoping to drive up to PA to canvass several weekend days over the next couple months.  If you're interested in doing a caravan, knocking on some doors, and maybe getting dinner in PA before driving home some weekends, let me know 🙂  The first day I'm thinking I'll go is Sunday Sept 22.

Content: Hi y'all - we had a GREAT in-person event in a rural and formerly very red area of our county yesterday, but where there are lots of cheaper housing developments going up and new families = some of them must be Democrats. We launched canvassing, had a party after at a Black owned restaurant, and had activities for kids like making Swiftie bracelets for voting, karaoke and the DNC playlist, had free pizzas, and lots of signs and enthusiasm. One guy yelled "Harris can kiss my hairy ass" as he drove away like a baby - we shouted back "she doesn't want to, honey!" but we got more honks of support than mad hollers. Apparently our Republican committee is freaking out and want to know how they can have more events in that shopping center (clutches pearls, faints on couch). Just to say - hang in there, and keep getting out there. One lady who came to the event said as a Black woman with opinions she feels like such a target, but coming to see she's not alone meant a lot to her. We had Black elders there too, and y'all, their stories. You, in your community, probably know someone who remembers having to pay a poll tax in Virginia. We're NOT GOING BACK!

Content: Our texting team is amazing if you wanna try that, check out <#1266829704204386334> as for specifically tim Kaine, I have no idea, sorry! I recommend just going for it with phone banking though! I was incredibly stressed my first time but after a few calls it starts feeling natural.

Content: I am a bit worried about VA-7. Spanberger was such a great Rep. and I volunteered for her last campaign. Lots of independents and Republicans loved that she was moderate and readily available to her constituents. IMO, Vindman doesn't have that same appeal and I'm not sure about skipping debates. At least Wextons old seat seems safe.

Content: I have checked all sites looking for this information. I did see that some voting information sites offered the information in Spanish. 
I will call to see if I can get this question answered. 
It is a bit frustrating. 
We want everyone to have access to voting and yet I am trying to help some of the Hispanic voters I know and this seems an obvious question… 
EVERY vote is important. And these ladies are definitely voting for Kamala and Tim. 
I volunteered to drive them to the voting locations but I need to know if they will be able to read the ballots.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!

Content: Hey folks! Thank you for joining us. **Together, we will write the next chapter in the greatest story ever told.**

Phonebanking is our **number one priority** so close to the election, and it’s a phenomenal way to get started. We often set goals for specific numbers, like how we set a goal for 5 million calls this past weekend. We made 4.6 million, reaching immense numbers of people!

We’re 300,000 calls behind our goal for the day, and we urgently need to call Wisconsin voters. Early voting starts today in Wisconsin, and people need voting plans! We’re only **14 days away** from the election!

[Can we count on you to help us? Please, click here to get started and call directly into Wisconsin!](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=32641249-daa7-4253-b97b-df11f362bdb3&ref=go_kh_calls_wi&utm_source=hfp_w_go_calls_20241022&utm_campaign=hfp_w_go_mb_do_vol_vrec_calls_20241022&utm_medium=go_kh_calls_20241022&utm_term=go_kh_calls_20241022)

We know it’s scary for many of you. I have the same anxiety as well. But a second trump administration is much scarier. We can do this!
