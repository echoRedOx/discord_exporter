(You can even make it private!) Here's how you can do that through Mobilize: https://events.democrats.org/c/convention2024/event/create/?utm_source=dnc_organizing&utm_campaign=sms_stw_mb_ds_vol_vrec_20240809_vm_natl_b1_a_na

Content: is anyone reviewing the emails for MI  Victory? is anyone reviewing the content Submitted. I have sent emails 7 days ago and have zero response. Also who is handling the Social Media. The Facebook Page following is embarrassing. Why have a Page that no one is pushing? I posted to several FB groups to Like the Page. 
This is how I found it before I posted.

Content: Hi. My friend and I are coming to Michigan to knock on doors from Oct 21-27. We will be starting in Detroit but can come to a different area if needed.  Who can guide me as to where we will be best utilized.  We have done A LOT of door knocking over the years.  And I understand if I should wait and ask closer to that date.

Content: Hi Cordelia - That's terrific!! I suggest focusing on the close U.S. House races we need to win to regain the House & see Hakeem Jeffries with the gavel: District 07 [several counties near Lansing] is the one Elissa Slotkin is leaving for her Senate run. I knocked on doors the last two cycles for Elissa in Livingston county. District 08 [Bay City area] is open because Dan Kildee retiring. District 10 [just north of Detroit] is where Dem Carl Marlinga is running. Unable to attach a district map here for you. Michigan Demcast has a list of MI House races they think will be closest based on the last election. With the Michigan One Campaign, you will be able to work simultaneously for House, Senate & Presidential races

Content: I knocked doors last weekend as a local of Traverse City. Elissa Slotkin was there to start the day and explained there are 4 areas she is focusing on with the highest concentration of gettable independents for the statewide races: Traverse City, Macomb County, northern Oakland (Rochester Hills, Lake Orion, her home of Holly) and the Grand Rapids suburbs.

Content: Drove 90 minutes from out of state to knock for Kamala in Michigan. We were instructed by the Berrien Dems to knock for state level Michigan candidates. Initially, no Kamala materials were provided in this must win swing state. We pushed the issue and they found some Kamala materials. Lots of Trump flags in this traditionally blue area St Joseph. Harris Walz needs to get in touch with Berrien county Democrats. Every canvasser should've been given Harris Walz materials without asking. This is happening in Indiana as well. The down ballot candidates only care about their own races. I had collateral for 14 different Michigan people that were not Harris Walz.

Content: I had door knocking in PA but was given materials before heading out so hopefully what you‚Äôre reporting gets rectified. Re the trump flags, not sure I‚Äôd be that concerned - isn‚Äôt Berrien county GOP for the past two or three election cycles? They also sent me to a more conservative Trump leaning county which is also prob why I saw more Trump flags and law signs there

Content: I'm a CA resident that is interested in moving to MI for the final month of the campaign to help organize. I can pay my own way to get to wherever I will be most helpful to the campaign, but I was hoping there might be another volunteer or member of the campaign that has a spare room that I could stay at while I volunteer. Please let me know (in DMs) if anyone can help connect me with the right person!

Content: Hi <@648018187342053395> So you may have figured this out already, but for this question, the dates should be posted by the Secretary of State Site For MI.  The excerpt in the screen shot comes from https://www.michigan.gov/sos/elections/voting/early-in-person-voting#WhenCanIVote. If your friend lives in a community with additional days of early voting, they can find out using this site to look up their registration. https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/index.  Thank you.

Content: If they want to have more specific information about when, time of day, and where they can do early voting, direct them to https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/Index/#yourclerk to find their municipality's city/county clerk. All the info should be there.

Content: Hi Michigan people. I've just been working over with the text team, and talking to a very nice guy named Rickey (who presumably lives in the area of the Bernie Sanders event) - who was most adamant that we need to print up more yard signs and send them out there ASAP. I thanked him (and directed him to the official KH shop, of course) and promised that I'd pass that suggestion along.

Content: So can‚Äôt find anything specifically but maybe ask in the general conversation and see if the host can direct you to some organization.. I think the easiest would be to the call the Michigan democrat party in Lansing from their site - https://act.michigandems.com/a/contact-us

Content: Is there really no answer from the Harris Campaign about Arab outreach in Michigan. I FIND THIS REALLY CONCERNING.  Please tell me that the Dems aren't blowing Michigan again, by not doing enough outreach to ALL our potential voters.

Content: Hi <@1273275170747842614> - campaign staffers are usually not in the state channels unless they are state staffers. https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140179/kamala-harris-arab-americans-michigan I would start by searching for the groups the news media are saying met with Harris today

Content: I guess, but this is a big one in Michigan and the media reports have been saying the Harris Campaign wasn‚Äôt doing much. Glad they are finally getting moving on it. 

I mostly am just trying to help a volunteer with a specific interest. She hasn‚Äôt been able to figure out where to help. I forwarded her both the suggestions. Thanks.

Content: Most meetings of Biden-Harris admin and Muslim/Arab/Palestinian community began in January. Positions on both sides have evolved. On Aug 8th Harris and Walz met with Arab leaders when they were in Detroit. The highest ranking Arab county official endorsed Harris as a result. The Engage Action Muslim group endorsed Harris two weeks ago.  Here is an article on the Uncommitted group   https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/uncommitted-movement-kamala-harris-trump/index.html - "‚ÄòUncommitted‚Äô leaders say group will not endorse Harris but warn against vote for Trump ‚Äúwhose agenda, they said in a statement, ‚Äúincludes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing.‚Äù The group also said it was ‚Äúnot recommending a third-party vote‚Äù because of the potential for ‚Äúinadvertently‚Äù helping Trump in key swing states.‚Äù  And another article appears to show some blink spots by the Dem's approach https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/arab-muslim-americans-michigan-harris/index.html

Content: Arab/Muslim/Palestinian Vote in MI: In the last 1-2 weeks, several groups gave endorsements & went in different directions - only the Imam group is strong for Harris. Here are recent some recent articles. Jill Stein is a major threat in MI. Kamala has a new ad against Stein today that I can't locate. Uncommited group has strong statements against Trump. In Feb the uncommitted vote was large in Wayne & Washtenaw counties https://michiganadvance.com/2024/10/08/abandon-harris-endorses-green-party-nominee-jill-stein/  https://www.tag24.com/topic/israel-war/uncommitted-movement-comes-out-against-trump-but-shies-away-from-harris-endorsement-3324476  https://deadlinedetroit.com/articles/32383/local_arab_american_activist_critical_of_gaza_war_writes_freep_op-ed_saying_no_choice_but_to_vote_for_kamala_harris

Does anyone know if the Kamala Harris has restrictions on who is allowed to have signs in their yard? Here in our local we are being told that only volunteers are given yard signs.

Content: I think because they easily run out - they have to organize these ‚Äòpick ups‚Äô rather than have walk ins. Prob the best bet is to sign up and try reach out to them in terms of logistics and how many you‚Äôd be able to pick up etc

Content: We have been volunteering nearly daily at the location I just mentioned. They let us take signs but we have many friends who want signs. We have also volunteered assembling the signs, they have plenty at Local 651, though they limit people who visit to pick up signs to two, even an elected trustee who told them he has a ton of people  who want them. He said there should be signs on every street corner, especially in the city. My question is why isn‚Äôt there a greater effort to get these signs out, some people are already voting.

Content: Congress woman @pramilajayapal made this video in Detroit, MI yesterday where she is canvassing! DJT said in a rally this past weekend that he will take away citizenship and the right to #VOTE from naturalized citizens. This is important in so many critical ways to many of us here who have spent our best years in the US building and serving the communities around us! Share widely https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBHJX7BSbbD/

<@1276944250491113656> IS THERE ANY VIDEO CLIPPINGS OF TRUMP SAYING THIS THAT THE CAMPAIGN TEAM CAN SHARE? Would be powerful to pair this with her statement

October 25-27 we will host guests from around the country for an inspiring weekend of unity and action to help deliver Michigan for Harris/Walz. We would love it if you could come. We am working with the campaign and other leaders in MI to join a VIP outing in Detroit on Saturday and we want to get an accurate count.

We hope you can join. It will be lots of fun.

Content: Hi Anne - That's terrific!! I suggest focusing on the close U.S. House races we need to win to regain the House: District 07 [several counties near Lansing] is the one Elissa Slotkin is leaving for her Senate run.   Here is a sign up for door knocking in that district    https://www.mobilize.us/onecampaignformichigan/event/632227/    District 08 [Bay City area] is open because Dan Kildee is retiring. District 10 [just north of Detroit] is where Dem Carl Marlinga is running. With the Michigan One Campaign, you will be able to work simultaneously for state, House, Senate & Presidential races. Here are other events https://www.mobilize.us/onecampaignformichigan/?country=US&event_type=1&state=MI

Content: Hi. You guys have been very helpful so far. I am coming to Michigan to volunteer from the 22-27 and still having a hard time figuring out where I can be most useful door knocking. I'm thinking of District 07 and wondering if anyone knows if there is a campaign office that I can go to get my walking lists?  I only see one time slot from 5-7 on Wednesday to help Hertel or a big Campaign for Michigan office in Lansing or around there.  I'd really like a home base campaign office since I'll be there for multiple days.  I realize that might be such a 2016 thought since it seems like the campaigns are set up differently now.  Also since I'm looking for ways to help during the day on weekdays, there doesn't seem to be as much set up.

Content: Hi Cordelia - Great that you'll be here in Michigan! THANKS. District 7 is a great choice. I door knocked for several cycles in Livingston Co. Here is the office address:  8028 Grand River Ave #7 Brighton, MI 48114  (810) 229-4212  I see slots for Wed and Saturday on Mobilize. The county is mostly red, mostly rural - will be easier going in cities like Brighton.  Bluer and more populous is Ingham County [capitoll & Mich State U] Dem office at East Lansing Office, 1400 Abbott Rd, Suite 160 East Lansing, MI 48823 (313) 936-0785 There should be many time slots but I can't find much either.

We could use some help posting campaign-related news to those. We find all of the posts for you -- you don't have to do any work besides posting a few articles here and there (depends on when there's a rally or other event).

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: Reach out to Marvelous Michigan! I did some ballot curing there by phone. But for residents you can canvas to make sure voters who have had their ballot rejected gets cured. Here is the notice by Jake Halpin:          "For those that I haven't been able to introduce myself to yet, my name is Jake Halpin, the Harris for President Campaign's Deputy for Ballot Cure here in Michigan. Together with each of you, my team is working to build the largest Ballot Cure operation Michigan has ever seen to make sure the 10,000+ Democratic ballots we project to be rejected in Michigan this cycle are counted for Kamala Harris.
We are officially launching an on the ground Ballot Rescue Program to launch on-the-ground volunteers across Michigan to notify and help cure voters. This is an operation without precedent here in Michigan and we're counting on volunteers across the state to step up in the last 17 days of curing to help us win Michigan for Kamala Harris.

Data shows Ballot Rescue door knocking is by far the MOST EFFECTIVE form of voter outreach -- if you've got extra effort left to give, this is what to give it to. Here is the form for MI residents wh o are intrested in helpingto fill out: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlh9krB0RIaLtn_KpZjsErwFu0LhFLRmRtkp1nA1eJ3vyVMw/viewform

Content: Here‚Äôs a list of Michigan counties within driving distance from Chicago, plus Van Buren County:  

- **Macomb County** (~5 hours)  
   - *Working-class bellwether that flipped from Obama to Trump and narrowly backed Biden‚Äîkey for union outreach.*

- **Oakland County** (~4.5 hours)  
   - *A suburban area trending blue, but turnout on issues like abortion will determine 2024 results.*  

- **Saginaw County** (~4 hours)  
   - *Flipped from Trump to Biden‚Äîunion support and economic messaging are critical here.*  

- **Washtenaw County** (~4 hours)  
   - *A Democratic stronghold; high youth turnout in Ann Arbor is essential to offset rural losses.*  

- **Van Buren County** (~2.5 hours)  
   - *A swing county that Trump won twice but could be contested if Democrats push rural outreach and jobs messaging.*  

- **Monroe County** (~3.5 hours)  
   - *Leans Republican, but Biden made gains‚Äîan opportunity to reclaim working-class voters.*

Content: Hey guys any advice on this? 

Several of my out of state family members have requested their absentee since August and have NOT gotten anything. The person at our clerks office was very suspicious and only confirmed the ballots were coming after one of them lied and said ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait to vote trump‚Äù. I told them to call the hotline but I really don‚Äôt know what to do

Content: Good news everyone!!  By flipping the legislature blue, Michigan was able to pass a law making vote counting faster!!!  And today is the first day of ballot processing!!  32% of the total 2020 turnout has already voted, with a total ballot return rate of about 61%!  If you can, please go out and vote early, or if you are voting absentee, please deliver your ballot yourself to avoid delays.  Don't take your foot off the gas!

Content: Hey folks, Chicagoan here.  BLUF: Where should I take my friends to canvass this weekend (both days)? I.e. who needs our help the most?

Long story long: we've canvassed for local candidates in Chicago, as well as in Kenosha and Racine, WI for big democrat the past couple of weekends. We can drive as far as Kalamazoo or Battle Creek Michigan, or anything in that range into Michigan or Wisconsin. This weekend we were redirected from Kenosha to Racine because they had enough volunteers there, which got me thinking there might be places a bit further in that need us more.  If you know a county in need of help whose office I should reach out to let me know and I'll give them a holler.
