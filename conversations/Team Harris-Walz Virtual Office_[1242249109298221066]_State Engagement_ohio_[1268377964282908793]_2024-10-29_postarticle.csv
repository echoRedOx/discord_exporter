Seeing how the votes on both Abortion and also on Super Majority dictating the Ohio Constitution, I think Ohio has a shot to be turned honestly. Its a no-nonsense state with a lot of really amazing people. I think the issue is that many just don't realize the things being said by DJT. Lots of voters have just always voted Conservative (like regular DeWine Conservative or Kaisch Conservative) forever and belive the ""radical"" heading the left gets. I think that could be changed if we can find a way to point out that what DJT is proposing is actually radical."

A No vote would keep things as they are now which is described fairly well here: https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/ohio/?cycle=2020&level=Congress&startdate=2022-03-02
