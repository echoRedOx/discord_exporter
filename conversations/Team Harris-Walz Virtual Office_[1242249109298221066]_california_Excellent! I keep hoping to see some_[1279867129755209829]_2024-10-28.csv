I know a lot of ppl who are looking for local opportunities but aren't getting responses back from local offices. I will dig into who might be/ if there are voter registration pushes or other opportunities for people who are looking for more in-person community building events.

I know the SD NOW chapter met at the Mission Valley library last week but I wasn't able to make it. I will check their website to see if they have any new info.

I signed up as a volunteer for the SD DNC but haven't heard anything. I figured it would be bigger in a few weeks
