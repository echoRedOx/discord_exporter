Content: I have a Twitter thread going to combat misinformation, where I write short article posts on a variety of common topics Trumpists argue falsely about; also updates with new content regularly. All sources are cited and credible (ex-CDC studies; official gov’t docs). I imagine it’d be great for community notes people because you can copy/paste straight from the posts I write and link to the sources too. Also great for self education or in response to trolls. But I don’t want to post it in the wrong place! Just updated it today with more myth busting facts on the whole “born alive” debate. Link below for review; please let me know where it should go or if it’s not allowed.

Content: Hi <@1275940050772951051> you have the Twitter Community Notes role and access to the online engagement channels. Those would be the best place to share your resources.
