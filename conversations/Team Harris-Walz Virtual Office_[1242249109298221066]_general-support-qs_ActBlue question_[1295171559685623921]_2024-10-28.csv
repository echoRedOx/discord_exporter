I've made a number of donations to what I believed to be Harris-Walz campaign, as well as some of the Congress campaigns. All of which has been through ActBlue, as far as I could tell, by following the links in the emails.

Now I seem to be getting two kinds of messaging claiming to be from the campaign. Some mention the amounts that I've donated and are based off of that. Others claim I haven't donated anything ever and asking if there's anything they could say to convince me to start. I've also gotten messaging to the effect of ""the Harris-Walz does not do X00% match donation requests and there are campaigns that pretend to be our campaign that do that and we've missed out on millions of dollars that way""

And honestly at this point I'm just really confused as to who I have been donating to, who I should be donating to, how I should tell, if there is a way I can see an overview of the recurring donations I'm making, etc. I could probably figure it out on my own once I have the energy but I'd also really appreciate hearing from someone ""official"" on what's going on."

And for me, the end result is that I'm just even more reluctant to donate than I normally am, and if this is the case for many other folks then that's kinda not ideal, so I am posting this in part as a heads up and feedback so that someone is aware of the situation if they aren't already.

I kinda take all the ""we approved the ads even though the money wasn't in the budget"" and similar messages with a grain of salt at this point after seeing them recycled a few times. I do realize fundraising on what seems like reasonable messaging isn't necessarily effective. But at the same time I don't want the campaigns in question to end up in that situation for real because they've cried wolf too many times and ended up losing people's trust and burning them out. This may not be an issue that can be meaningfully addressed by November, but I do hope it's something that could be kept in mind for the next election (especially midterms)."

But the fact that I'm getting messages saying I've never donated suggests that at the very least there are two records in whatever system is being used to track that, and that's also not ideal"

I can give you some insight but I don't know everything. First of all the best way to be assured you are donate to Harris for Pres, or Harris Victory Fund is to do it [here](https://kamalaharris.com/) that is actblue connected directly to the campaign.
The message you get are probably coming for two reasons.
1. the ones that want you to donate same amount again are from the campaign 
2. the ones that sound like you never donates, are getting your contact from the email or phone listed on your voter registration. these messages don't check with the messages I mentioned above. 
You can stop the messages by typeing ""stop"" or unsubscribe. And just donate direclty instead of responding to a message.
The messages promising matching contributions are spam, maybe malicious spam, either way don't reply.
To see your recurring donation, you need an actblue account. or review your credit card statement
And lastly, I don't know anything about the down ticket campaigns work, but it should be similar"

As suspected. Thank you for the response though, it does clear it up a bit"
