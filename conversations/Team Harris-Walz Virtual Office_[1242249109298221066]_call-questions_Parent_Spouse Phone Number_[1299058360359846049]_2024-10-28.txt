Content: If we are connected with a parent/spouse and the voter isn't there, what is the protocol? Should I mark it down as a wrong number? I've had this a few times, but specifically today, the number was for the voter's father, and he said she was away at college. She voted yesterday, but he doesn't know for who.

Content: If the phone number is correct, but the wrong person answered use busy/call back. If the phone number no longer belongs to the person you can use wring number

Content: "Call Back" since that seems like the only way to get the right person on a shared phone line.
