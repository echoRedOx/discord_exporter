  content: I just got onboarded for texting and I was told to use my first and last
    name [with state in brackets]. Is it ok if I remove my last name or just keep
    an initial? Will this impact my Scale to Win account, which has my full name?
    I noticed many people on here including mods only have their last initial, so
    I hope it's ok if I do so too. Many thanks in advance!!

    to firstname last intial though.

  content: Thanks Jack! And this won't affect anything else by doing so? Like will
    my discord and scale to win still be connected?

    anyway.
