  content: "This isn\u2019t so much a question as it is feedback. In the call trainings\
    \ it might be nice to encourage callers to keep a little notepad/journal when\
    \ they call; that way if they come up with lines or ways of phrasing things that\
    \ they really like, they can keep reusing them. I also think we should put an\
    \ emphasis on smiling before people start each call. People on the other end can\
    \ really hear the difference. My two cents. Thanks."
