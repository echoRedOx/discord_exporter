I can finde video snippets everywhere, and the audio podcast. But not video. 

Omg. “Some of us are not aspiring to be humble.” Best line evar. 

I am so conflicted because I think Harris is the best candidate in modern times who represents my POV and then I read news about Blinken approving bombs on humanitarian aid (both paid for by our tax dollars). 

Just going to trust the process for now."

It was a great interview with some hard questions. My favorite quote from Kamala: “Some people think the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who they beat down, but the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who they lift up.” KAMALA FOR THE WIN!!!"
