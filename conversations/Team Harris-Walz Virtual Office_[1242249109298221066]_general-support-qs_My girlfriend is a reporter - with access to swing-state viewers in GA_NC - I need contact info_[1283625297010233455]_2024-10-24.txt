Content: Hello.

She is reaching out via official channels that she is finding right now in response to this article. https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/11/kamala-harris-post-debate-image-00178773

If any mods, or staff members have an official contact for her campaign, or want to discuss this further - please reach out. Due to the nature of her news station and her position I am not comfortable revealing more information (but can provide proof privately).

I am a volunteer for the Kamala campaign, and I see a unique opportunity here to have a direct channel to voters. 

PLEASE CONTACT ME URGENTLY.
