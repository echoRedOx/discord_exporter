Content: Most folks I’ve been getting on my calls have been only able to talk very very briefly and using a script seems like it’s just gonna turn them off and I can’t call it up, etc. quickly enough what if people found to be very effective in these circumstances? It seems like people just don’t have time to talk and listen to much at all or they’ll just hang up.

Content: It’s OK to adapt the script a bit to what works for you.  It’s required that you say you’re a volunteer (for Dems etc) and that you review the script to understand the purpose of the call and convey that.  But you don’t have to use the exact phrasing in the exact order and most callers personalize a bit and ad lib a bit as well.  Just please remember to stay positive and that people will associate you with Team Harris.

If you want to mention this in the <#1242256751445934262> channel, others will likely jump in and tell you how they personally work with this dilemma.

Content: But yes, definitely shorten and get straight to the point if that’s what gets the job done!  Just remember to say you’re a volunteer, stay positive, and know the goals of the call (like to recruit volunteers or to get out the vote).  Good luck!
