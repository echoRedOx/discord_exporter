They will receive more information in the confirmation email. Due to security reasons, we don’t have more specific information. 

**What if they want to bring a friend/family member/their kids?**
The more the merrier! The person they are bringing has to also RSVP separately and get a confirmation email as well. The invitation/ sign up link can be shared, but the RSVP/confirmation email is unique to the person it’s addressed to and non-transferable. Kids under 18 do not need an RSVP form or an ID. 

**What if they haven’t gotten their confirmation email yet?**
Tell them to check their spam folder. It will arrive 24-36 hours before the event.

**Will they still get the email confirmation if they don’t get a call?**
Yes! They will get the email confirmation regardless of whether they get a phone call.

**Is it ADA accessible?**
All of our events should be ADA accessible. There should be a contact email on their confirmation email that they can reach out to to ask about accessibility information. 

**Can they bring bags/medical items/food/etc?**
Security information relating to all of these items and protocol should be included in the confirmation email."
