I'm texting wth this campaign and the Gavin Newsom campaign.  When I verified my account last week, I changed my user name for the Newsom accunt to this account.  They are asking me to delete the user name for this account on their platform.  Will that have any effect on this account.  They willnot let me in with a new user name.  My user name on this account is betty_9778 and the orginal one for Newsom was betty_97787.  I hope you can help me with this."

Does that help?"

Newson is asking if you can change my accont with you to betty_97787.  Do you know if I delete the Newson account will it delete this account as well?

There are two servers, the Newsom server and the Team Harris-Walz server. Your account has one profile name. You can have different profile names on each server."

It got messed up when I verified my account with you last week.  I did something wrong.  It won't let me change anything becasue when I put in the betty_97787 on  the Newsom account it won't let me change it back.  When I verified my account with you I changed everything with Newsom (phone number, email).  That's when I entered the used name incorrectly as betty_97787.  the said I was listed on you site with both user names as well.  Can you change my user name back to betty_9778 on your end.  that's what they are asking me to do.  Or do I just delete everything and start over?"

It would be best to continue with that account here and with Newsom.
I would suggest getting an invite to Newsom's server and clicking on the green plus in the lower left and adding that server. Then you will have both Team Harris-Walz and Newsom in the same account. Then you will be able to adjust your Server names for each server."

I think this is the simplest answer

That is another solution , with that method you will have to log out/in every time you move between Team Harris/Walz and Newsom."
