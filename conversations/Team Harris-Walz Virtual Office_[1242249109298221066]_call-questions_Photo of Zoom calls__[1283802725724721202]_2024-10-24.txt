Content: Last night, I was on a phone bank (my third) and the moderator wanted to take a photo of us (I'm guessing a screenshot of the Zoom). They asked us to pose with our cell phones. I was wondering how these photos were going to be used. It didn't really bother me (I'm proud to be phone banking for Harris Walz team) but I wasn't sure if all of us phone banking were comfortable with this sudden request. Just putting this out there FYI.

Content: <@824045831673872385> This is the first time I've heard of this. I'll check with staff to see if they can tell us more.

Content: Thank you. Again, it didn't really bother me, but I was curious as to what it was for since there was no explanation (or I may have missed the explanation). But if there are hundreds of folks doing phone banking, there may always be those who wouldn't want their names publicized. Our names are on our Zoom screens.

Content: <@824045831673872385> I've found out that our partner organization for west coast phone banking does this often during their Zoom sessions to post the image on social media. I've also made a recommendation that in the future they ask first to allow anyone who does not want their images published to opt out. Thanks again for making us aware! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Content: Just a FYI - for the most part if you photograph someone for "editorial purposes" you the photographer, are somewhat protected but if those photos are used for profit, it is illegal. Best practice: ask permission before you use someones image.

Content: <@824045831673872385> usually, when people host a party (whether a watch party or a phone bank or another event), theyre encouraged to take pictures. I have only ever seen these pics used for volunteer slide decks, so they aren’t getting publicized anywhere. 

Just weighing in because I facilitated a private phone bank and the host asked me about the same thing.

Content: What's the difference between the Slack HW calls team and the one here? I trained to do the calls through slack and the dialer there.

Content: The campaign keeps the SLACK crew active with so many active experienced callers from the 2020 and 2022 campaigns. Slack has the "anytime calls" feature that callers like. DISCORD builds community with a lot of opps for volunteering. For calls - both use the dialer "Scale to Win"

Content: Thanks for that info. I find the discord interface confusing. Are there pinned messages? Where do you find them?

Content: For Phone Banking the most direct is to sign up for a shift: https://events.democrats.org/event/664004/  Otherwise on DISCORD - look for the CALLS TEAM heading (along left side) and find multiple channels for resources, welcome, announcements, questions, etc. main one is <#1242256751445934262> If you do not see the Call Team check your settings in <id:customize>
