Can I toggle between campaigns in the REACH app WITHOUT losing all my data entered for the previous cmapign? The REACH chat support people cannot answer this quesion; they say they will e-mail me later. This is such a simple question. Anybody know the answer?"

(Most states have their own state campaigns.  If you don't have a campaign key, then you can ask for an invite.)  The national party's campaign key is ZUMT5Q."

Yes, I know that I can use the ZUMT5Q code for this national campaign. BUT are you absolutley sure I will not lose any data I already entered for the Powered By People campaign in Texas (which is NOT connected in any way to this national effort)? When I go to enter the ZUMT5Q code, the REACH app warns me with this: ""You will no longer be able to access Powered By People in Reach."""

In Reach, I joined the campaigns of the national Party, DCCC and my state party.  However, I never got the warning that you quoted (which would also worry me if I got it)."

I think I can just use the 6-letter code at the end of the URL in a web browser view of REACH and maybe that will not give me the warning. My guess is that the warning was carelessly written.. and that it is probably easy to simply toggle between campaigns. I'll try it via web browser instead of the app. Thanks for checking your approcah. That is re-assuring."

I bet it will work on the app too. Thank you very much for your help!!!"
