One of the BIG problems is that people on the mobile app (so, I believe this is probably true for the tablet, haven't checked) cannot see tags as easily. We are finding A LOT of people who neglect to tag conversations correctly. It may also be more difficult to see all the survey responses and canned replies. 

So basically, texters are making mistakes in their conversations due in part to using a mobile device rather than a desktop/laptop. This creates a lot of work for us mods on the back end of things...also will create a lot of feedback to texters."

I will see what things look like on my tablet, and if I can't find the tags I'll switch to desktop. I  used my tablet in 2020 without problems, but maybe things are different now."

In 2020 we used ThruText, so the interface was completely different."
