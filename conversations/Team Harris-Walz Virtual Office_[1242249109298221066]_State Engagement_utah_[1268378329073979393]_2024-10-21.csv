I wanted to reach out to see if anyone here knows of any events or outreach efforts in southern Utah, especially Cedar City? Someone reached out on Facebook and said she worries she’s seeing more Trump-focused events and not enough of us Dems. I was just wondering if there was something I could send her way as far as volunteer opportunities (voter registration, canvassing neighborhoods, etc) go. And if anyone in here is working down in that area in that all. I’d just love any info if anyone has any. Thanks a bunch!"

You want to make sure your site / post is different. Think about who is not represented in what you already see.  Since you posted in the state channel, I would imagine you want local youth.  My first thought would be colleges, including community colleges. However, for diversity sake (since not everyone attends college as a youth or at all),  go to coffee shops, gyms/ rec centers, media/gaming stores. These are places where younger folks are likely to work and hang out when not working. Write up a paper flyer to invite those whose voices are not already being heard to join in your channel post. Anyway, I hope this helps and good luck to you."
