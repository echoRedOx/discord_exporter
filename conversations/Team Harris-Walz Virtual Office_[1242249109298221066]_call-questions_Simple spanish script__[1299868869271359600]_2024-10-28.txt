Content: Some dialers hanging up seeming to be for language issues. One person in the phone bank is fairly fluent but wonders if there is a Spanish script or suggested points they could work from -- anything like that available?

Content: Unfortunately I don't know enough Spanish. We have separate phone banks where Spanish-speaking volunteers reach out to these voters. Please be sure to mark as Language Barrier:Spanish so they get on that call list!
