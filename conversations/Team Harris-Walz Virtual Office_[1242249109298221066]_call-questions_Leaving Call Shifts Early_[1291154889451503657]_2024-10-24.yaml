  content: Quick questions for the the Captains. I know that the call shifts are usually
    about two hours, but I've found that after about an hour, I'm not as effective
    as I could be. I've been trying to do an hour a day, but is it OK if I'm consistency
    only doing half of a full shift? I know its not ideal, but its the best I can
    do right now.

  content: <@1277403295211847763> It's totally fine to stay less than the 2 hours.
    We appreciate any time you can give at all! If you are not staying until the end,
    you should ask for the debrief form in the chat to give your feedback.

  content: And if you are ever getting burnt out -- which can easily happen if you
    get some tough calls -- you should always take care of yourself and maybe take
    a break. We want you to be okay!
