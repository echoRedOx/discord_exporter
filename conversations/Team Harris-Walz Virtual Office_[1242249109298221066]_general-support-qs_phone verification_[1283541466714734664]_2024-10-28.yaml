  content: It says that my phone number is already attached to a discord. I do not
    and have never had another discord with this number or any number. Therefore I
    can not follow the directions that guide me to log into my old account and remove
    the phone number. I submitted a ticket to Discord but don't know what else to
    do and do not want to be unable to continue in this server

    back and forth with Discord with days and they are not helpful as it is just a

  content: <@589189350848200706> it is common to have an "accidental" second account
    and there is a process for getting the phone number out of that accidental account.

  content: I was successful in retrieving an old account and closing it. I entered
    my mobile number instead of my email and then clicked on "forgot password". I
    don't remember the exact order of the steps. I do remember that I received a text
    with a 6 digit code to enter into my computer. And I received instructions to
    create a new password. That got me into this old account that I had completely
    forgotten about. I then went to settings, my account, account removal, and deleted
    the old one. It seems to take a few hours or maybe a day before the account is
    deleted. After that the phone number should be freed up for use in your current
    discord account.

  content: Hi <@1273055554608300126> thank you for sharing your process for successfully
    verifying your phone number. It's not necessary to delete the other account, but
    it's fine to do that if you don't need the other account.
