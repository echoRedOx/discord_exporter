Content: I'm sixteen and I want to do my part (seeing as I can't donate). What can I do to support the campaign?

Content: Hi Akari! I’m new to the Harris campaign and not a mod, I just want you to know I did my first campaign at your age 20 years ago and it does a weary heart good to see you here. I have a niece who’s also 16 and she and her sister are the ones I’m doing this for.
