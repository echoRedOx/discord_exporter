Content: But what is the back story? Was Tim Walz involved and how? We know the Republicans will turn any little molehill into a mountain, but does the campaign have  a reply, explanation?

Content: The campaign does not reply to specific news stories except what you will find on social media and occassional press releases, which are not listed online anywhere. They just show up in news stories mostly. 

So on this server, since we're really just focused on online volunteer campaign work and don't get this far into the weeds most of the time, we like to have these conversations in <#1268690577960992878> where those interested can discuss (but not debate) and develop an informed response should it come up. Though, it's unlikely to come up often in volunteer work here since it's highly specific.
