    of the next steps for the VOTE team. They are the volunteers who help during our
    Zoom Phone Banks.

  content: <@933109418034335787> Moderating on Discord is a different type of process.
    For my clarity, are you looking to be part of Discord Moderation ( Answering questions
    and promoting engagement here on Discord for the calls team volunteers ) or part
    of the VOTE Team (Answering questions and providing technical support to our volunteers
    during our Zoom phone banks)

  content: Thats great! If you like engaging in conversation, directing folks in the
    right direction, answering questions, and you have a comfortable grasp of Discord,
    the Call Mods team could use your help. Let me see about connecting you with someone
    on the Staff within the Calls Team. As for the VOTE Team and opportunities to
    be a Data / Chat Captain, you can sign up for your preferred training using the
    links above. We are excited to have you on the team!
