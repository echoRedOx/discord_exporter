  content: I looked on the DNC website and the platform is from 2020.  Can we get
    the 2024 platform posted and in a place where we can refer folks when they ask
    about issues/policy/goals?  It would also be good to have more issues info on
    the Harris-Walz website.  Thids came up during our phonebanking yesterday. (Sunday,
    August 25). Thanks!

  content: Yes, saw this saying the platform would be voted on.  Asking now for the
    platform itself.  We know it was voted on and adopted.  We need this for those
    voters who ask our phone bankers about issues and policies they can expect the
    candidates to pursue or invest in... Looking for the document.  Thanks.
