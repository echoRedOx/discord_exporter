I am very frustrated. If anyone has gone to one and can share how they got tickets, or if anyone knows how to get them outside the advice Iâ€™ve already gotten here, please let me know. I saved all my bday money in case the tickets are expensive and this issue is so important to me ðŸ¥¹ Iâ€™ve been trying all week to get answers. Now everythingâ€™s closed. Iâ€™m desperate! Please help! The rallyâ€™s this Monday so I need to figure it out this weekend if I can."

The details of rallies so far have all been last minute announcements, for security reasons. Often the best place for last minute info is social media. Check on Kamala's or the campaigns social accounts."
