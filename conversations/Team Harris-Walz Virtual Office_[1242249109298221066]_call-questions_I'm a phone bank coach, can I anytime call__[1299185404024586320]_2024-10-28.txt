Content: Hi There, I'm a phone bank coach for the last few years with The Bay Area Coalition(Virtual Phone banks) and I am also coaching at the Dem HQ in San Francisco.  I would like to make calls from home outside my coaching shifts.  Do I need to do the Anytime Call Training?  They seem to be using Slack...

Content: Hi Sandy! We here on the Discord calls team have a program separate from Slack, but you can indeed do calls anytime from 9am until midnight ET! Just [sign up here](https://events.democrats.org/event/704955/ ) for immediate access to the dialer, and then fill out your [debrief form](https://forms.gle/cJohAPgrSRH7S25Y7) afterwards. And here is our [training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FYlZK0essc) if you need it!
