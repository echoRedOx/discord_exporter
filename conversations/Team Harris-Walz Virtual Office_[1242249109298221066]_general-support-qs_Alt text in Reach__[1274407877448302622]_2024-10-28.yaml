  content: 'Is there an interface in Reach I''m missing w.r.t. alt text? For content
    with a lot of text, it is pretty cumbersome to reproduce all of the info by-hand
    in alt text, especially from mobile. Does Reach provide alt-text for it''s content
    somewhere?


    If not, can this be added as a feature? I try to ensure my posted content is accessible,
    which increases reach and is pretty vital on platforms like Bluesky which have
    strong norms around including alt-text.'

  content: Thanks for doing that! I responded and upvoted. I hope everybody else up
    votes. This is an important issue. Blind people and others who rely on assistive
    technology cannot access images without alt  text
