  content: Unfortunately I accidentally closed the tab when I tried to check which
    campaign, so it's theoretical I guess. It was in Michigan and the woman had already
    voted for Kamala.

    "Strong Harris."    We don't yet have a button for already voted.

  content: Also, on the Zoom call yesterday, the facilitator and staff person said
    we don't act on self-reported voting.  Depending on when states count votes, we
    may get back-end data that allows us to remove voters from lists, or we may continue
    to call them for volunteer opportunities.

  content: I was told yesterday that the campaign is pulling voter data daily and
    updating the calls lists accordingly. So people should be taken off the lists
    within a few days of voting (depending on the processing time for mail in ballots)
