Was thinking about, in the past, I've seen people holding signs on a bridge over I-5 during commute hours. 236th has sidewalk on the North side for AM and 220th is on the South side for PM. Don't get me started on why there isn't sidewalk on both sides. Wouldn't be built like that today, thanks to Biden. Anyway, if people are interested I would like to do that.

I'm interested in local efforts, but focusing on swing states. 
The post card idea is interesting. Old-school, but back in the day mailers & door hangers were considered vital tools.
I've done calling & texting. Both have flaws but if done right can work.
There was a ""vote-trading"" app back in 2016 called #NeverTrump. Very cool idea.
Then there's various social media platforms...
What is the best bang for the buck?
UPDATE: I found this site for postcards: https://postcardstovoters.org/"

I see ‚ÄúYES‚Äù signs all over, and they are clearly lies! 99% of people living in our state won‚Äôt ‚Äúpay less‚Äù if I2109 is passed. Public schools will suffer‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúTo protect critical funding for schools, early learning, and child care, the Olympia City Council passed a resolution yesterday opposing Initiative 2109, a state ballot measure that would repeal Washington State's capital gains tax.  

Enacted in 2021, the capital gains tax applies a 7% rate on the sale or exchange of certain long-term assets, such as stocks and bonds, for individuals with annual capital gains over $250,000.‚Äù"

It's also incredibly important that we make sure that people with mail in ballots have gotten their ballots and understand how to return them. This is such important work, and we have to close strong. But we can't make our 10 million call goal without your help. If you're experienced, you can go straight to our dialer [here ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=933f666e-c699-46e3-ac92-12d9cf6f3992) - if you're new, please join us over in <#1242256751445934262> to get connected to some training! (If you don't have that, go to  <id:customize>  and choose ""talk to voters in key states."") Even making a few calls helps. Many hands make light work. Will you please come over and join us?"
