I'm a freelance entertainment journalist based in Manhattan (and I'm looking for employment and gigs due to the industry lay-offs but that's another story). While I'm registered to vote in Galveston County, Texas, I do fight for Harris and downballots in my New York State area. I also was involved in the 2019 fight for ranked choice voting for NYC. If only Republicans weren't so determined and pouring money in misinformation, New York State would have voted for redistricting and same-day-voter-registration in 2021! 

In my spare time, I also design Canva about the New York State Equal Rights Amendment on the ballot since the NYS fights to codify abortion rights while expanding protections to age, disability, ethnicity, LGBTQ+, and national origins. #VoteYesOnProp1 #FlipYourBallot.

 I also know that NYC voters have 5 ballot proposals to vote on as well.

I am also a writer and member of the Vietnamese community. Do we have any Vietnamese Harris supporters here? Unfortunately, large populations of  Vietnamese Americans are ardent Republican-Trump supporters and are exposed to disinformation campaigns about Kamala Harris. So Vietnamese (and fellow  Asians) should connect with me.**

** I am looking for those to volunteer their translation support for Canva ads. And I want to talk WhatsApp engagement because so many Asian communities engage in politics (and misinformation) in WhatsApp.**

And I do think it's important for non-Asians to be aware of the disinformation amuck in our communities and ask how to fight it."

I did also have this earnest conversation about being aware of downballots this November, because voting for the right downballots builds the right infrastructure for a Harris presidency (even if the campaign itself hasn't endorsed to local races).

For example, I talked to them about the pro-abortion, pro-LGBTQ+, pro-disability Equal Rights Amendment / Amendment Against Unequal Treatment on the STATEWIDE Prop 1 ballot. One of them, a particular Harris voter, was surprised to learn that the right to reproductive health isn't really codified (unless voting in the State ERA might change that.)

And for New York CITY voters, there's even more talk about the ""Charter Revision Commission Adopts Ballot Proposals"" on the NYC ballot."
