The Swiftie group said The Harris campaign has reached out to them. We can promote their events here and discuss but just no fundraising links at all please, per campaign finance law and rule 3 of server (just have to say that for everyone to see, sorry).

Content: Also, be aware, there are multiple groups of Swifties campaigning. Swifties for Harris is at that Facebook and Swifties for Kamala is mentioned in the article I linked. But we can't vet or endorse any of them since they could be started by anyone. Please keep that in mind and use caution with non-official campaigns (at your own risk). Thank you.

Content: Hi Elianne, you will get more eyes on this if you ask in general-conversation, I also gave you the online engagement role so you can ask there too.
Reach has filters and you can put Spanish in for filter and see what shows up.

Content: Hola people who give a 💩 about the planet. My creative partners and I recently launched a grassroots campaign called Creatures for Kamala. 

We asked ourselves: Who benefits from Harris being President? 

The answer: Every. Living. Thing.

So we’re offering a collection of free digital artwork for people to download, in both English and Español, that features a wide variety of creatures with a stake in this election.

The call-to-action is simple: print and put up a poster. In your home, at your office, at school, a park, a coffee shop. Somewhere. Anywhere.

We currently have five posters. There are many more creatures to come. 🐿️ 

Here’s our website 👉 https://www.creaturesforkamala.org/ 👈

If you’re into it, please share and put up a poster!

Content: Hi RootsMusic! Catholics for Harris-Walz an official coalition campaign (within the HFP campaign), so you can post this one anywhere on the server if you like. (Harris for President, noted at bottom of the graphic, is the big umbrella campaign everything official falls under). Thank you! I am not sure on the other two, I would have to check sources for the organizations hosting these events. Feel free to DM them to me if you'd like me to check.

Content: **Strict Fundraising Rules (it’s the law):**
We can only fundraise on behalf of: Democratic National Committee, Harris Victory Fund or Harris for President directly. 
We can recruit for "non-official events" that are hosted by partner organizations or volunteers in ⁠non-official-events-only. We can recruit into anything that is listed on events.democrats.org or a state democratic party's mobilize.
Rule 3 Note > Relevance: Do not post links to petitions or other calls to action that haven’t been approved by Staff. This forum is not intended for debates. Additionally, do not attempt to raise funds or share fundraising links for any entity besides the Democratic National Committee. Using this server to raise funds for yourself, another candidate, or another organization violates campaign finance law and is strictly prohibited. Anyone who violates the rules is subject to removal or time out.
When in doubt, ask @Community Moderator.

Content: Campaign finance law does not allow us to post links to non-official fundraising events whatsoever. If it's a phone bank or similar activity, without fundraising, it is allowed in this channel only. If there is any fundraising, it's against campaign finance law. Not our rules, it's just the law.

Content: It would be considered that, yes. I love it, but per the law we can only post anything that involves raising money that is not directly DNC. Merch would benefit whomever is selling (NARAL, in this case) and is often used as a means to raise funds. I hope that makes sense, and thank you for understanding. 🙂

Content: I dropped this in the volunteer welcome section, but this might be the better spot for it.  First exposure to Discord, so if this is not an appropriate post, I apologize.  Anyway, this is a little something I published over on Daily Kos.  It is the latest in my series of trying to encourage friends and family in battleground states to get involved.  https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/8/19/2264209/-Blue-Waves-Start-With-Ripples-COVID-Toolkit-DNC-Watch-Party-Edition?_=2024-08-19T08:49:02.000-07:00

Content: Hi Steven! You might know this already, but just in case you didn't know YouTube recently also added a Community Notes feature, which can help combat misinformation. I believe on the mobile app you can opt in to the waiting list by clicking Settings, then General, then "Help Inform Viewers." It'll take a bit to get approved, but accounts that aren't freshly made should eventually be able to access this! Apologies in advance for any new or evolving information - I believe this feature is relatively new for YouTube

Content: <@&1245831457818279986> <@&1266883962727432304> I’d like to help out on states other than my own (ie voter registration and getting people rides to the polls). Any advice or guidance for how to get involved in that way? Also, hope this is the correct place to ask. First day on the discord 🙂 ❤️🤍💙 Hope everyone’s having a great night! Very excited.

Content: In September, I’m hosting a private house party with postcard writing and live music. I have the invite set up in Evite and would like to include a URL where people can donate $50 per person to the Harris campaign as their ticket price. Would be ideal to track how much I raise through the ticket sales. Something similar to the pages people can create for Pan Mass challenge or Boston marathon etc fundraising. Does anyone know where and how to set up a personalized fundraising page?

Content: Good morning! Yesterday I posted a link to a postcarding group for one of the volunteers who was asking for opportunities, but it got deleted with the "Strict Fundraising Rules" warning. I'm not sure why, unless it had a link somewhere on the page that either offered postcards for sale or a donation tab. If that's the case, most, if not all, of the many groups I write postcards with would get removed. Is it okay to list the groups here? If not, type "democratic post card campaigns" into a Google search and a lengthy list of opportunities will pop up.

Content: There was one postcard one yesterday I removed b/c it's full and they don't anticipate opening up new campaigns. 🙂 Otherwise, yes, if they have obvious donate/fundraising links on the landing page of the event, we have to remove due to campaign finance law. But we do love these!

Content: I'm new to this whole thing, but if we wanted to advertise a community gathering in support of Harris - Walz, and were planning on encouraging fundraising at that gathering, would we be able to post it here, or is that not allowed? My understanding that was we COULD post non-official campaign events in this channel?

Content: Oh no, <@789106202658471957> I'm so sorry, that one has a big donate button on the actual link so I have to remove it per the campaign finance law.  It looks like a totally awesome event though!

Content: Hey yall. I wanted to share another organization that I work with. It is called *Field Team 6*. It is another organization that focuses heavily on voter turnout, voter registration, and more. It reaches out to voters who usually do not participate in elections but are Democrats/leaning. For example, this week we started sending texts to people to register them to vote in North Carolina/Georgia. They are always looking for more help and basically have an unlimited amount of people that need to be texted/called. For me information please visit https://www.mobilize.us/ft6/. WHEN WE FIGHT WE WIN!

Content: **Hi joyful warriors! You can post these state race updates in this channel, but did you know you can also post them in the state channels? That's right, as long as there is no fundraising/donate component to the link/article you share, it can go in both this channel and the appropriate state channel. Be sure to post in the state channels for more eyes! Happy campaigning!**

Content: Not sure if this video will be taken down or if it’s appropriate for the server, but I thought it was really well articulated and worth sharing. She really emphasizes the importance of *voting in all elections* and not just when it’s a presidential race. 

It’s no secret that a Harris/Walz administration will be much **stronger and effective** if backed by the House and Senate majorities. So it goes without saying, volunteering in your local campaigns (in any way you can) will make a huge difference! Even if not local to you! Phone banking for candidates in other states that are trying to unseat Republicans — we can help flip them! Just need to push through and get the message out there! We got this, Joyful Warriors! 💙💙💙

And **thank you** to every single one of y’all! This team truly is a gold mine in more ways than one! 🗣️<:thankyou:1252806147396735057>

Content: It’s worth mentioning that Osborn is not a democrat and has actually refused the support of the democrats; according to the Nebraska democrats this violates agreements that they had in exchange for not fielding a candidate. The democrats are going to support a write-in candidate.

Dan Osborn is much more likely to take the seat than a democrat, however.

Content: Hi, <@1280220071351812107>! yes, you can ask over there, and the Harris/Walz campaign does not have postcards, but there are lots of other groups doing them! Hosts can be a great place to ask, or you can Google other national groups doing this, too

Content: <@389839010576465936> this is super cool. I know we've had phone bank vols talking to people who needed help with this. Consider adding it to the state channels where it's applicable to get some localized attention. I can add it to the <#1268378299428634727> channel for you. You can add channels to your Discord through the Channels and Roles tab at the top of your menu (and you can remove them after if you don't want access to them anymore).

Content: Hi Jen! Thank you for the idea of adding a channel and then removing it! I’ll do that! 
I just got onboarded to VoteRiders, and wow, there are thousands of open cases. So many people need IDs across many states. The organization trains well, gives you the choice of state to help out with (I chose GA since it is a battleground state), and gives you an expense card to use for fees associated with ordering IDs, Birth Certificates, Social Security Cards, etc. for voters. It’s definitely one of the ways I’ll continue volunteering after November as well.

Content: Hi <@1264664181697675285> I personally love this site and have been using it, but since we know that many of those organizations solicit donations to sustain their work, we can't publicize the site in this Discord server. I'm going to remove it, but wanted to give you a little insight into why. Campaign finance laws are no joke and we don't want to give anyone any reason to undermine the win we're working so hard to achieve.

Content: I know, I apologize. There's been some confusion on this because campaign finance rules are tricky. But essentially, if the org hosting the fundraiser isn't official Harris campaign (DNC) run, the CFRs don't allow us to promote it here.

Content: The fine print at bottom says it's opting you in to all their stuff. The weblink itself is an every action website link. This channel for non-official events is really for events only and not recruiting into other orgs and such, which is what links like this are doing. If they are on events.democrats.org or Mobilize, and they are not doing any fundraising, they are allowed here.

Content: Hi Kate! While it has a link that goes to HVF Act Blue, the group itself is not official DNC. We got this confirmed this morning. The fundraising laws are very strict so in order to remain in compliance with the law it is better to be safe and not allow any links or mentions of groups who are also doing any fundraising, or taking donations, even on behalf of the campaign.

Content: I'm wondering about the utility of having this channel at all, given the difficulty with posting non-campaign events. I haven't seen any come through that don't get pulled down due to the fundraising laws, which are a legit problem. I wonder if rather than posting directly, these events could be DM'd to a Mod to vet and post if it meets the criteria. That way the channel can get locked down and cleaned up. Right now it's a bit of a mess trying to sort through all the autobot fundraising warnings and back and forth regarding these restrictions.

Content: Hi Carol! Some examples of the non-official events that can be posted here are: debate parties thrown by volunteers, phone banking/text banking for other candidates, and other types of organizing actions that don't include fundraising. It's also helpful to direct individuals here if they are looking to connect with others on non-official events and actions. You are right that the fundraising explanation can clog up the channel. I think we had a more recent surge of fundraising posts in the last 24 hours. If it starts to be a regular thing we can look for a solution that provides the poster with an explanation, but doesn't take over the channel.

Content: Hi Kent! You can send people to our Volunteer Welcome sign-up! This will get them oriented to the various opportunities we have available and they'll be sent a link to join Discord during that meeting!
https://events.democrats.org/event/671638/
If they can't make it to one of these, you can invite them to sign up for any of our events at http://events.democrats.org/

We work mostly in digital mode, but you can either print flyers, using art that you find in the Reach app or check with one of the states you are affiliated. State channels are at the bottom of the left-hand navigation.

Content: I’m a woman in NY near the PA border and my friends and I are planning a couple day trips to PA to place post-it notes “woman to woman your vote is private” in women’s public restrooms. I’d like to go to counties within an hour or so of Binghamton/interstate 81 that we have a good chance of flipping. We have friends in the area and are mindful of safety issues that may arise. I’d appreciate any guidance anyone may have!

Content: This is something I think could go in <#1268378088069267456> maybe? Highly specific questions to local events are best in your state channel as they aren't part of our online teams here in the server. Can you post it there?

Content: So are letter- and postcard-writing campaigns like Vote Forward actually effective at turning out _specifically Democratic_ voters? I've heard that they're efficient at turning out voters in general, compared to other tactics, but I want to focus my efforts on increasing Democratic votes. Letter-writing could be a fun activity for me, and it's easier to do during downtime at school because I don't have a laptop. I know they target some groups that are statistically more likely to vote Democratic, but I don't know what they do with voter registration (or how they even have a list of registered voters to send to? they're not a political party)

Content: Hi Vyvi there are several tactics that are effective. Post cards and letters are part of an overall approach. There are several listed in this channel and you could also check your state channel. Have you also checked the activities near you using this link?

Content: Yeah, I've been to Mobilize and the Democratic subsite plenty of times. I don't live in a swing state so there aren't very many activities near me focused on the general election, which is the thing I care the most about. I did some letter-writing earlier this week and really enjoyed it.

Content: I just googled if letter and postcard writing targeted dems or repugs and found this interesting: They have their "experimental" results listed. It doesn't look scientific, but at least a data point. Link is turnout pac postcards faq, I had to removed the link as it had a contribute button that isn't allowed.

Content: Thanks for the info! The part I found most interesting was "whether you vote is public record". I thought most states required you to enter birth date in order to see voter registration information, which essentially makes it private to everyone except close circles?

Content: You enter name and location. It will search just with state, but depending on how common the name is you could get too many results without the city too. It really feels like a LOT of info.

Content: Hi <@789106202658471957>. Thank you for posting event's like the National Women's March on November 2nd. We could not keep the website for the women's march on Discord due to the donation button on the website. It will be against campaign finance laws.

Content: It's National Disability Voting Rights week!!!  Build the power of the disability vote. That means making sure every one of the nearly 👉40 million eligible voters with disabilities is registered and ready to vote and has access to the ballot.

For more information, tools, and resources go to theAmerican Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) website for more info:


What: Build an Accessible Future: Power the Disability Vote
Celebrate Disability Voting Rights Week: September 9 to 13

Disability Voting Rights Week (DVRW) is a nonpartisan movement hosted by the American Association of People with Disabilities and REV UP. DVRW is about advocacy, celebrating community, and building power.

Why:
The disability community makes up an important voting bloc. Disabled voters are a part of every community. Yet, systemic barriers prevent many people with disabilities from accessing their right to vote.

Who:
DVRW was created by grassroots disabled activists. DVRW is a cross-disability, cross-movement week of action. We invite all community members and allies to join us.

How:
DVRW includes: voter registration and education events, candidate forums on disability issues, digital organizing, engaging with elected officials, and creative actions. You can:

Host a Voter Registration or Education Event
Activate your Social Media
Organize a candidate town hall on disability.
Write an op-ed for your local newspaper.
Partner with other disability and voting rights organizations.
Ask your local government leaders to issue a proclamation for Disability Voting Rights Week.
Get Involved:
Go to AAPD's website  Disability Voting Rights Week  “Join the Movement”  - for  Disability Voting Rights Week updates, free social media graphics and messaging in English and Spanish, access to a nationwide calendar of events, and more.

A note for phone bankers- Phone was answered by wife of the person I was calling. She stated he had a stroke. Unfortunately she hung up before  I could  offer her information about voting as a person with a disability. I hope that they get mail-in votes.

Content: Hi <@997238923183018098> there is a little problem. Your YT page links to your KoFi, Patreon, and Store those are all fundraising. So unfortunately we can't have your event here. You could make an event on https://events.democrats.org/host/ and that would be super.

Content: Yes, they are very legit. And effective. I've texted and postcarded with them for years. Great group...and they only register Democrats. Lots of other voter registration groups are non partisan and often wind up registering more Republicans.

Content: Hi Mary, usually the postcards would be mailed to you. It can take a couple of weeks to receive them in the mail. In my case, they told me that it would take up to 4 weeks to receive them (I signed up for my postcards in August). I’m still waiting, but I’m excited for when they do get here!

Content: # 🚨 🚨 Before Sept. 16th- Verify your phone number 🚨 🚨
## We are increasing server security

❓ What do YOU need to do? Check to see if you have a phone number on your account. Phone numbers have to be mobile numbers. Landline and VOIP won't work. If you have not, set up and **verify your phone number**. For more information on how to check or verify your phone number on your Discord account, use this [support guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20you%20can%20also%20verify,beside%20the%20Phone%20Number%20section!) and scroll down to “Verify Your Phone Number”.

🛑 If your phone number is not verified by **Sept. 16th**, you will not be able to send messages or interact in the server until verified.

🔐 To achieve the best security within this Discord server, our admins will be enabling the strictest verification level available to us. This change will occur on **Monday, September 16**. By increasing our security, we will be able to verify all current server members, AND protect against bad actors infiltrating our community during the final stretch of this campaign! 

✅ Your phone number will not be shared with the campaign, or anyone on our server. Only Discord will have this information. For more on this, please see [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

Content: # 🚨 🚨 Before Sept. 16th- Verify your phone number 🚨 🚨
## We are increasing server security

❓ What do YOU need to do? Check to see if you have a phone number on your account. Phone numbers have to be mobile numbers. Landline and VOIP won't work. If you have not, set up and **verify your phone number**. For more information on how to check or verify your phone number on your Discord account, use this [support guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20you%20can%20also%20verify,beside%20the%20Phone%20Number%20section!) and scroll down to “Verify Your Phone Number”.

🛑 If your phone number is not verified by **Sept. 16th**, you will not be able to send messages or interact in the server until verified.

🔐 To achieve the best security within this Discord server, our admins will be enabling the strictest verification level available to us. This change will occur on **Monday, September 16**. By increasing our security, we will be able to verify all current server members, AND protect against bad actors infiltrating our community during the final stretch of this campaign! 

✅ Your phone number will not be shared with the campaign, or anyone on our server. Only Discord will have this information. For more on this, please see [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy). 

🤎 If you have any questions or trouble, please ask a moderator. Thank you for helping us to create the safest, and best, volunteer community!

Content: <@1266164208928686110> Hi Nieta. We cannot mention the the event you posted or request anyone contact you in DM to get more info. The event is a fundraiser. Only non-official events without any fundraising can be on our server unless they are our events hosted by the DNC, per Campaign Finance Rules. It's the law. Thank you for your compliance.

Content: I checked. It is a rally for Harris, but it is not a fundraiser. Where is the information that states that? They have a donate button on the website because they are running for office themselves. That is why I removed the link from the flyer in the first place.

You can ask in your state channel too, they sometimes have local resources as well. Thanks for taking action!! Let's win this!!

Content: I think bots are deleting events that are not in violation of the rules. I know that Neurodivergent Voters for Harris happening on Thursday, 9/26 just a call to inform voters how to get involved and to vote only. I understand that the are rules but I think instead of allowing the bots just to delete a post.

Content: I wanted to share this event that takes place every Friday at 2pm EST, from now until Oct 25, over Google Meet. It's quite enjoyable to listen and become well-informed about VP Harris' track record and accomplishments! It truly feels like a chat among old friends while taking some time to highlight the best attributes about our next President! <:kamalaharris:1269013846564012083> <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> The host, Klaudette, is beyond exceptional in gathering the info for every session (each one touches on different topics) so I hope some of you might end up joining us! I've found that the insight I gain from these calls, I'll often bring up in casual conversations and during phone banks! It would be an absolute delight to see if we can increase our audience for today, even if it's just one more person! Hope to see you there! 🤠 <:blobcheer:1278915863491383377>  https://www.mobilize.us/2024gavictory/event/672900/

Content: Hi Alex! Is this the correct event? https://artistsforharris.com/ If so, it looks like the donate button actually does lead to the official donation page for the Harris Victory Fund so that would be good to share.

Content: Hi. For the people who were in the click me/approve call list channel asking about postcarding…..
I have some names/organizations you can look up. Not giving links because I don’t want to be warned about the rules and regulations. Third Act is donating up to 30 artisan postcards for free and you can use those with lists from Activate America. Activate America has launched new campaigns this week. You will be on your own for stamps, though. I emailed a contact I have at an organization that provides the postcards and the stamps to see if they are still looking for volunteers. If they do, I will share that info. Lastly, you can DM me if you are interested in a link tree highlighting lion’s share of the postcard campaigns, including some that are budget friendly.

Content: Hey! My name is Charlie, and I’m with Movement Labs - we’ve started a new program called Beers and Ballots. It just kicked off last week; we go to bars and offer free beers to anyone who will text five friends and family members in swing states. (If you hit your metrics, volunteers also get a beer at the end of the night!) 

People have been really enthusiastic to talk to us so far; and we’re already partnering with way more bars than we can handle, so we could use volunteers! It’s one of the few ways you can contribute in person in deep blue cities. If you’re interested, here’s a mobilize link to get started: https://mobilize.us/s/cC4j8p

I work for the DC program, so I’m looking for DC volunteers, and the mobilize link is for the DC program; but we’re starting this program in Boston, LA, NY, and Philly as well. So if you have any questions, or want to volunteer from one of the non-DC locations, feel free to send me a DM and I’ll get you connected!

Content: Quick bilingual mod note: I moved a request to write a song in Spanish over from meme vault to here because I hope that we can get more linguistic and cultural diversity on our creative teams. That in itself is an ongoing effort and non official event. If anyone needs help in another language, we will try to do that by direct message. In addition to Latinos Con Walz, we also have Muslims for Walz and Arab Americans for Walz on What's App. If you did not know, spread the word to your friends. 🙂

Content: POSTCARDING OPPORTUNITIES in case you're available during downtime here 🖋️ 🗳️ 

I've been postcarding for a few years with Reclaim Our Vote, a project of The Center for Common Ground. They focus on inconsistent and new voters of color in voter-suppressed states.  They require that you order and use their postcards (not expensive) and your stamps. 

There's also Postcards to Voters, which has a lot of campaigns all the time, I first worked with them to  elect Doug Jones to the Senate (sigh.)!  And a lot of folks write with Postcards to Swing States, a project of Turnout Pac. 

Below is a postcard I sent to Florida before their primary, and links to the three organizations.

Content: I've been writing with PostcardsToVoters almost since they started. It's a wonderful way to write postcards, and they are active year round--their Facebook group is great, too, and very supportive. They're writing for Sherrod Brown right now, among others. Highly recommended!

Content: I'm partial to Blue Wave Postcard Movement - they have you buy their postcards and they supply address labels. They also have a short message to write. For me, it's the easiest, but I'll bet my postcards aren't as fun! I need to get a fun-colored pen! 😄

Content: Good for you for taking care of yourself and knowing what you need. I used to be really anxious/scared of in-person canvassing as well. I decided to push through it and got pretty used to it to the point I became a local organizer. My friends got used to me bugging them to come out, I'd buy donuts or treats, we'd all get our fave hot drinks and head out. It's not for everyone though, that's why I'm so glad we have lots of ways to get involved virtually! Are you phonebanking or friendbanking with us?

Content: Thank you! 
Would you help others learn about phonebanking/feel more comfortable giving it a try? Share your whys, your stories, the impact you've seen it have, etc.? Post in <#1242249109298221069>, state pages. It can really help to hear from people who have done the thing, who do the thing EVERY DAY, like you (really amazing), to ease, or jump, into it!

Content: Hi <@1267218248491991095> I love what you are sharing here! Most of these are perfect for this channel. I agree that the Massive Swing Sates looks great, but somehow field team 6 manage to get a donate link on the mobilize page (I have not seen this before) so unfortunately that one has to come down, but you can describe it for find another way for folks to sign up that would be okay.

Content: If you're looking for some variety in your phonebanking diet, I joined the Voter Protection phone bank a few times now and want to give them a shout out. The team that runs it is great, and the calls are important. A lot of other voter protection efforts require extensive training - here you can get trained on the spot and start making calls. https://events.democrats.org/event/684133/

We can only fundraise on behalf of: Democratic National Committee, Harris Victory Fund or Harris for President directly. 
We can recruit for "non-official events" that are hosted by partner organizations or volunteers in ⁠non-official-events-only. We can recruit into anything that is listed on events.democrats.org or a state democratic party's mobilize.
Rule 3 Note > Relevance: Do not post links to petitions or other calls to action that haven’t been approved by Staff. This forum is not intended for debates. Additionally, do not attempt to raise funds or share fundraising links for any entity besides the Democratic National Committee. Using this server to raise funds for yourself, another candidate, or another organization violates campaign finance law and is strictly prohibited. Anyone who violates the rules is subject to removal or time out.

Or <#1266829704204386334> may also know when PA is coming up next. 
And you can check in the PA state channel; you can add it by going to <id:customize>  and adding PA under states.
Thanks for helping out!! Let's win this!

Content: https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/719823/ phonebanking and in-person canvassing is of course super valuable, but hand-signed postcards have value too. There are a TON of groups out there sending lists and postcards, and lots of community groups willing to help fill them out. Even if you don't want to write, contributing postcard stamps may be another way to help out.

Content: Hey everyone!

I’m Tyler, and I’m excited to join this community! I’m a content creator with a channel focused on reporting current events from a progressive, democratic perspective. My videos mix witty humor, satire and sharp analysis to poke fun at the GOP and highlight important issues. However, the YouTube algorithm seems to be showing my content to the wrong crowd (lots of MAGA), and I’m hoping to attract more like-minded Democrats and progressives.

I’d really appreciate any support you could offer in helping me reach the right audience! Looking forward to connecting with all of you!

Thanks so much! 😊

Content: Hi, Alex! I don't know which event it was, but you can feel free to dm me and we can take a look at it. A lot of event links have donation buttons, QR codes, links, etc. right there, and due to campaign finance law we can't have those on this official Harris server.

Content: Excellent! a mobiliize event will be perfect. Folks will feel much more secure singing up through mobilize than giving their personal info on an unknown Google form that you're saying is the itinerary. How about we take this down and celebrate your success when you are ready with a completed mobilize link

Content: <@1268364888670208133>  I don't have any suggestions that are solely for texting PA, but this is an ongoing Gen Z text bank to "Key states", which should include PA at some point I imagine: https://www.mobilize.us/grassrootsdemocratslahq/event/665318/ This is also for texting key states/close races, and is open to everyone, not just Gen Z! 😉  https://campaignfordemocracy.com/text/ I don't know if either of those are helpful, but wanted to share just in case! ☺️

Content: Hey <#1268378299428634727> ! Now that you watched the big Senate Debate, I really hope you'll join me and other Texas Democrats in our statewide phonebanks to talk to as many TX voters as possible before Election Day! We know this is gonna be a tight race, with national impact, so we need as MANY volunteers as we can get to TURN TEXAS BLUE!!

We have shifts Tues-Thurs evenings and Sat/Sun throughout the day. Find all the phonebank info and signup links per week here: [Calls For Colin](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uf9a-DN720GRs27EFfEiT0QqzPIFjtLJtv47g08Y7a8/edit?usp=sharing)  - and THANK YOU!!

Content: Thanks, I need a contact who will respond. This is where the obstacle is, finding a human who can answer specific ADA questions, but a non-response is the standard answer. But the effect is the same: no ADA access at the event upcoming here in the state.

Content: Yes that was my first reach out. I did the same for the last campaign stop here in the state, but since I didn't receive any response to the email the first time, I thought I would step it up for this event to see if there might be a vol here on discord (besides me, haha) with a Nebraska contact who could give me the secret handshake to have emails or calls answered. 
Trying not to salt the vibe here, but ...

Content: For anyone who wants to write more postcards, www.postcardstovoters.org has some great postcard campaigns going to GA, OH, and elsewhere, and they are writing right up to the deadlines for mailing and expecting postcards to arrive by Nov. 5. You need to get approved as a writer, but that is straightforward, and the website explains the process well. I have been writing with them almost since they started, and I think it's a terrific group and very well run.

Content: Hopefully this fits in here too but the Ashley Ehasz campagin in PA could use some help with their phone banks. She is the Democratic nominee for Congress in PA's First Congressional District which is Bucks County and some parts of neighboring Montgomery County so we're talking about the suburbs of Philadelphia. Bucks County is one of the most contested counties in one of the biggest battleground states so this is important. Sign up here: https://www.mobilize.us/ehaszforcongress/event/709910/
