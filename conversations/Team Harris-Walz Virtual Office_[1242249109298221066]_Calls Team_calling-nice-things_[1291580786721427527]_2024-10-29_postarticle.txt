Content: I usually do not call voters much but I text voters. We get a lot of horrible and mean responses (I assume calling is like that or even worse). Mentally, it really helps, for me, to go to a channel simply for nice things/nice responses. I hope everyone on the call team enjoys itüòÄ

Content: I text and call both. I think people are actually much nicer on the phones. I think when people text back they aren't always aware there is a person reading them. On the phone usually if people don't want to talk they just hang up.

Content: Calling is MUCH nicer than texting. People think you're a bot over text, or you're just a faceless, voiceless nobody and they can say whatever they want. The worst thing that happens over calls is someone starts swearing and we hang up lol.

Content: We were calling to confirm attendees for the Reno rally tonight with Tim Walz (this had to be rescheduled due to wildfires last month) and so many attendees are older adults who are attending their first political rally. It was inspiring to hear and really validates that this election is special and is bringing people into political engagement in a way that hasn't been seen in a long time. 

Great job, team! You make that happen!

Content: I hear I am an older adult supposedly but nah. The only big rally I went to was taking my kid out of school early to hear the next President Barack Obama speak. She doesn't remember the speech but it was a magical fall night and practically my whole office came (it was nearby) and the 3 or 4 Repubs had the whole office to themselves ü§™ A few days ago my daughter and I went to Baltimore and saw Billie Eilish!

She wanted me to let everyone know that what we are doing is important and folks out there are going to "turn up and turn out" for this election for VP Harris.

Thank you Rebecca for volunteering your time with usüíôüíô and making me SMILE wide.  Also I told her about Discord and to ask for the link in the chat during debrief.

She was so sweet and just kept telling me about how she was so appreciative of volunteers like us. Really just warmed my heart

Content: Not necessarily a nice thing from a call, but I had a volunteer tonight with some vision limitations and she was struggling so hard to get the dialer to work. It took most of the shift to figure out the problem but we were able to get it working just at the end and she was really pleased to be able to make even 2 calls. I told her every little bit helps and now she knows what to do next time. <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

She said she‚Äôs been phone banking since Obamas first term and had been really disappointed she hadn‚Äôt gotten to this year. I walked her through the process of signing up for virtual phone banking and explained how it worked and she was so thankful

Content: This wasn't on one of our phonebanks but I also work with the ones for PA Dems and we had a volunteer tonight who called a guy who is a fierce LGBTQ ally and he said he is voting for Harris because he doesn't want someone in office that will take the rights of those he loves away.

Also, we just got one just a couple seconds ago on the 9PM shift of our campaign's banks where the person answered the call at a wedding and not only thanked the volunteer but also said while he can't phone bank, he's donating to the campaign! This is what I'm talking about, people! This is what we need in this world...we need to bring good back!

Content: Just had two new callers earlier this evening stay in the practice room a long time, two senior ladies who were determined to figure out what to do. We did rehearsal calls and they had such powerful voices and lovely connection skills, I knew they would be fine. They both came back to the debrief thrilled with their experience and have signed up for another shift‚Äî one of them tomorrow. It‚Äôs so worth the time for these new volunteers.

Content: I had one gentleman in PA on a call yesterday who was undecided, but really appreciated the call, and when I told him about the 50k startup tax credit proposal he was immediately on board since he wants to start a business soon. His whole family (15+ people) was also there for a reunion and he said he would talk to them about voting for Kamala as well.

Content: After a series of so-so calls into Georgia (T8 list), my last call was with a voter who is originally from Ukraine who explained that the only logical choice for him is VP Harris and how Trump will give Ukraine away if he wins. I know we all know this but hearing it from someone who is directly affected really drove it home for me. A great way to end a shift! üíô

Content: Spoke to a person in KY today who was super excited to host phone banks during the upcoming weekends.  She said she drives all day in her job and is so excited every time she sees a Harris/Walz sign outside of Louisville, which is the blue island in that sea of red.  She even stops to take pictures.

Content: YESSSS!!! That is the absolute best kind of call! A supporter connecting with others to volunteer! If 1000 people each connect with 3 more people to vote and volunteer---that can win us the whole thing!

Content: When you click on the Dials Dawn till Dusk link it will take you to the site to get the dialer link.  The dialer has a script preview and when you get started it automatically dials numbers and connects you with the voters.  If you have any questions just post them here in <#1242256751445934262>

Content: From tonight's calls: Spoke with Grace R a few calls back, she's 70 years old and with a walker, and although she's pretty fed up with politicians who don't keep their promises, and was disgusted by an ad that showed how Kamala Harris had paid money for kids to go have gender reassignment surgery, I let her know that was a lie and that she should go to kamalaharris.com and click issues at the top. We discussed for about 5 minutes what a dangerous, unqualified and untrustworthy candidate Donald Trump is, and finally she had made a plan to get out and vote. I only felt badly that I couldn't give her a ride to the polling location myself!

Content: Just stopped by to say that I was scared to phone bank today (first time!) but have gotten nothing but nice people (and polite refusals or hangups). I guess most people are too polite (or conflict averse!) to cuss you out.  I did have one guy tell me I was very misguided but he did so in such a friendly tone it took a minute for me to understand what he meant!

Content: I just spoke with a lady just trying to confirm her plan to phone bank with us tomorrow evening. She said she was a widow and in a very red area, and we ended up speaking for around 30 minutes. She clearly just needed someone to listen to her and she said some of her relatives were victims of Trump‚Äôs cult and were convinced so much misinformation and crap she heard on Fox News was true.It was really nice, and it seemed like she really needed to have a chance to get all of that out and Im glad I could reasssure her that there are other people who care and who aren‚Äôt willing to go back

Content: So much fun tonight with me and some millennial white guys for Harris (friends from high school and college). One lady gave me an analogy she said she shares with friends that likened Kamala to a hamburger and fries and Trump to pile of poo with glass in it. I couldn't help but laugh even if I didn't quite understand. Keep up the good work fellow callers!

Content: This is ultimately a nice thing. But I find it interesting when I get a Trump supporter and they are angry, telling me to ‚Äúgo to hell‚Äù as one person said. On the other hand, I hear so much joy and optimism through the phone from those supporting Kamala. I was once cancelled for saying Trump is a bad example of a leader for our kids. But this just proves the example he sets, even for adults. Kamala is spending every day working to bring Americans together. She sets the tone for a real example of a great leader and a lot of people are starting to hear that when we call. I‚Äôve never really phonebanked, but I am committing to several more days in the final weeks. We cannot go back and I can‚Äôt wait to move forward!

Content: From recent phone banks: two strong Harris supporters who'd gotten disconnected from the movement and were only too happy to learn they could still volunteer:  A Nevadan who'd just retired to AZ and was happy to learn he and his wife could phonebank for us into NV...  A Philadelphian who had to take care of his elderly father and was feeling alone but had found community through canvassing earlier and wanted to vote early and help out on election day.  ETA:  These were not volunteer recruitment calls...  but they turned into recruitment and solidarity too.

She said she‚Äôs terrified of snakes but if only trump was on the ballot, she would put a snake on the ballot and vote for that instead üòÇ then she proceeded to tell me her entire life story from beginning to now (yes it took a very very long time) but because she‚Äôs voting Harris and I figured she‚Äôs probably lonely,  it was worth sitting on the phone with her and listening to her talk.

Content: This is so nice---thank you for sharing! I know it's very hard, but next time someone proceeds to tell you their life story, try to politely wrap it up and move onto the next call so you can make even more good connections! A good rule of thumb is no more than 5 minutes on one call, only because we want to make sure we're contacting as many voters as possible! Thanks so much for calling with us tonight üôÇ

Content: Tales from the ZPB

‚Ä¶as told by a facilitator

Monday 10-PM to midnight (eastern time)

* Volunteer who out of the chute got a Harris supporter (ie. His first call of the night)

* Woman voting for the first time‚Ä¶for Harris

* Elderly man who said he‚Äôs flying his 89-year-old sister home in time to vote for Harris.

* Several volunteers persuaded people who were considering Trump to reconsider and now they‚Äôre voting for Harris.

* An elderly lady who was for Harris convinced her son who is a registered independent & husband who is a Republican to follow her lead.

* One volunteer presented a a case for Harris like a lawyer‚Ä¶and the caller is now going from wanting to vote for Trump to voting for Harris! 
********
And some bonuses from the PA Dems phone bank I did earlier‚Ä¶

* A guy who was talking to someone who was leaning Trump got him to convert to our side

*A lady got someone to register to vote on the last day of voter registration in PA to vote‚Ä¶and they‚Äôre voting straight Dem!!!!

We‚Äôre making it happen!!!!

Content: A Georgia woman called me ‚ÄúHoney.‚Äù That made my day. She and her husband had helped turn Georgia blue and had moved to North Carolina to help turn that blue. 

A Trump supporter called me the ‚Äústupidest person in the country.‚Äù I had always suspected that but it was nice to have confirmation. 

I let him vent for a bit but I did not respond with hate.

After hanging up and thinking about it for a while, I decided to increase my shifts from two to three a day, six hours, and fourteen hours on Election Day.

Content: I just had the most AMAZING call with a voter in PA. I have spoken to undecided voters before, but I can't usually convince them all the way during a phone call. However, this undecided voter is voting for Kamala Harris, and he also needed info about where/when/how which I sent him. This was after a long stream of hang-ups/refused. This made my day and I wanted to share!

Content: I know we don‚Äôt usually talk to wrong numbers, but this person seemed really nice and has apparently been getting a lot of campaign calls for someone who isn‚Äôt her, so I marked her ‚Äúwrong number,‚Äù but asked if she wanted to talk about the election anyway.  She did!  She‚Äôs strong Harris and has a plan to vote with her significant other.  She said she lives out in the country and has been seeing lots of Harris signs in ‚Äúplaces you wouldn‚Äôt normally see them.‚Äù  Gave me hope!

Content: Another Strong Harris who had a lot to say about the importance of migrant workers in her region and how she wants to see them getting treated fairly and having paths to become citizens.  She said she‚Äôs looking forward to a new generation of leadership!  Me too!

Content: From Nevada calls: Spoke to a lovely woman who said she was the not listed person, but her friend. She was firmly for Harris and wanted info about the nearest early voting location. We had a "full and frank" discussion about Trump and she ended the call by telling me she really was the person I asked for, but wanted to be sure I was "nice" before telling me that.

Content: I had a great (very long) call with a woman from Ohio who has volunteered in every campaign since McGovern in 1972.  She has followed Kamala's career from the beginning and made calls for her during her campaigns for DA SF and Attorney General of CA.  She said "When Joe Biden selected her to be VP, my opinion of Joe Biden went up."  She's planning to make calls again for Kamala tomorrow.

Content: Another beauty: "This has been the most engaging phone bank I have done. Persuaded several voters to trust their stated instincts about Trump‚Äôs selfishness and racism. They all made plans to vote Harris and the Democratic ticket. Also found a supporter willing to volunteer. I get the feeling that the people of NE are not yet burned out by calls. üíô"

Also, it feels like there's a pun somewhere with the word "call" and "Kamala". Like Kallmala or Kalls for Kamala.

They are also going to knock on doors and volunteer. They were looking for talking points and how to make arguments against rhetoric coming from the right. It was an awesome call!!

He has also been phone banking and adorably rattled off all the answers to save me time and we both expressed how much we are getting out of this effort personally - to be Doing Something! Much quick sweet mutual appreciation and on to the next call! 
Was the cutest call I've had yet!! üíì

Content: I think I just swayed a non-voter to consider a vote for Kamala!!! She had been under the impression that it costs money to register to vote, and I told her not at all, and sent her the link. I thanked her so much for taking time out of her day to talk to me. THIS is why we do what we do! üòç

Content: I am used to canvassing door to door and the main focus of that is to tell people where their polling places are - that seems to be the most helpful information to give in these efforts, but based on the script I studied, that type of information does not seem to be part of these calls.   Do we not give that type of information in these calls?

Content: my second call ever (first caller was a wrong number) and I convinced a guy in Georgia to go vote... he was convinced his vote didn't matter because his COUNTY was so strongly blue, and the rest of the state was so red. I let him know that for statewide and federal races every vote counts, including him... stayed on the phone with him for 30 minutes but he hates Trump and is voting EARLY for Harris!!

Content: my dad has been calling on his own after I hooked him up to a training (so I am sharing his nice thing, he's not on discord) and last night he had a gentleman who works part time in CO but is an NC resident - he couldn't figure out how to vote, thought he wouldn't be able to, but my dad helped him contact iwillvote to be sure he was eligible, walked him through how to order a mail ballot, and he will be voting! he said he'd really wanted to vote for Kamala but didn't know how and was super excited to do so. his second favorite call was a wrong number that turned out to be a Taco Bell. üòÜ

Content: Doing some calls because there aren't many texts right now. Had a lovely call with a voter in PA! He's 68 and started voting in his late 30s after he saw how important it is. He got his girlfriend to register to vote for the first time last week (right before the deadline) and is encouraging her to vote Harris/Walz as well. "We don't need that again" was his line on Trump. 

I was a bit nervous to make calls, but this was so fun!

Content: I have a book of quotes and I was trying to find one for my team today. I thumbed through the book and found a (100%) RANDOM* quote for my team ..but when I read it ..I realized it was for here.  it says "REVOLUTION" ....."Every revolution was first thought of in one man's mind." Ralph Waldo Emerson   (i relate that to calls. u never know who u may be talking to .."planting those seeds" ...proud to call w/ u guys)

Content: I just talked with an undecided voter in Pennsylvania, a young guy who had filled out everything on his ballot but president. We talked about what was important to him, mostly affordability and housing. He knew about Kamala's $25k new home owner plan, and while he didn't think he'd be buying in time but we talked and agreed that Kamala probably cares more about his future than trump, who cares only about himself, in part because Trump will soon be sentenced for crimes and will likely only get away from justice if he wins. Pretty hard to care about the country when you're busy worrying about your own legal jeopardy, we agreed. He said I could mark him as a lean Harris after that.

Content: I got an undecided tonight too! In AZ. We had a long convo - he was being incredibly thoughtful with his ballot. He said he was considering voting independent but when I told him that was going to only help Trump, he started to agree more and more with why Harris was a better choice. I think I was able to win him over!

Content: First day volunteer. Called a few hours in MI and WI.  No undecideds.. People who were willing to talk were mostly committed Democrats for Harris with a set vote plan. Many were frustrated with the calling volume but several were very appreciative of the call and thanked me for my efforts.  That was pretty rewarding but the best thing was helping a few people with their voting plans. People seemed to like when I offered to look up voting info for them right then and there.  That kind of thing kept me clicking the "continue calling" button.

Content: Just had a cordial conversation with male republican voter leaning Trump who is concerned about economy and inflation. He remains undecided but I think I gave him a good counterpoint... Trumps tax cuts and increase in deficit spending are guranteed to be inflationary. All economists agree the Harris economic plan will be better on inflation.  Right now, anyone buying US bonds are wondering how on earth US will pay for everything if Trump wins--this is keeping mortgage rates higher.

Content: Had someone today who was really nice but said she was waiting for God to tell her who to vote for, and that's the only thing that would make up her mind.  (Btw, there's no button for that üôÉ) We spoke for a while and I talked about why the election mattered to me and offered to help her with voting info.  She was really appreciative and said that God works through people so maybe that's why I was calling her then.  I'd consider that a quality conversation.

To see this discord/chat even more organized, supportive, inspiring, and thoughtful as 2020 has me feeling some type of way about how incredible and sustained this volunteer movement is!! Grateful for each of you and all that you do behind the scenes and on the phones!!

Content: Had a call today with someone who was not enthusiastic to vote as they "didn't really like much government anything." They were also not thrilled about about crime nearby where they lived. I thought at first was going to cause the call to go sideways... but I kept listening and she was concerned about Trump. I managed to get them straight to harris/walz by the end of the call. Project 2025 points helped with that a lot. It's my first time phone banking so it was great to have a call like this.

Content: I just talked with an older gentleman in Georgia. He said his biggest issues were the economy and the border. We had a good discussion and he said he was undecided. I think after our conversation, he is leaning towards Harris. This was the first call I have ever had that wasn't a hang up, so I was a little shaky, but I think we had a productive discussion. I was a little scared to do this before, but I feel better now and more ready to make calls until the election.

Content: Yes, it's great to use the dialer system to text them the info as the script prompts you to, but you can and should also talk them through the voting plan as well using the information on the righthand side of the script page so you can have many more of these great calls!

Content: I just convinced a Nevada young woman who was going to vote for Trump to go for Harris instead!  Woot woot!  I shared with her about news re Trump admiring Hitler and Trump's former staff warning about him.  It made a big impact on her.  Helped to spend a couple of minutes hearing her concerns first and repeat back to her - good connection first.

Content: Had a few voters who said they were undecided but pretty clearly were leaning Kamala and just feel that votes should be kept private. Also found that opening a call by saying "I want to help you get fewer calls until the election is over." helps to make them willing to talk lol

Content: Just talked to a lovely mother of 4 boys in Arizona.  She leans Harris, but was concerned.  Concerned about a "Kamala ad about sex change operations for inmates".  I asked if she was certain that was a Harris ad campaign or an opponent.... long pause... "You know, that was probably a Trump ad, wasn't it?"   I told her I didn't know, but it sounded like it was likely cleverly disguised.  Ended the convo giving her info on where she and her grandmother could do some early voting.  She sounded relieved that she could comfortably vote for Team Harris.  Felt wonderful on both ends.  I think this is why we do this.

(side note, does anyone know which ad this might be so I can be ready for it on more calls tomorrow?)

Content: I don't know which ad this is unfortunately but that's ok---no need or expectation for you to be an expert on the ads airing in local markets! The important thing is that you were able to persuade her AND provide her with the voting information she needed to cast her ballot, and that you both felt great after! This IS why we do this, so great job.

Content: Oh God... best conversation at the end with a Spanish speaking gentleman at the end of the night... wasn't sure if I should go ahead, but I speak it so, I did.  Needed information about where to drop off his ballot in person.  Gave him all of the information.

Also asked him if there were any family members of his who needed a push to vote.  He said yes.  I asked him to promise me that he would encourage all of them he could.  He promised me he would and that he would share all of the information with friends and family.  "*Thank you Kelly.... You Spanish better My English!!!*"  Then he wished a blessing on my father for encouraging my Spanish, on my family and on me for doing the good work since it makes him proud of be an American citizen.  *Gracias, Lorenzo!!!*

Content: Wow just had intense conversation with a young guy in Arizona who is scared to vote because of such intense harassment from Trump supporters when he has voted before.  All his friends are Trump supporters.  He was really grateful for the call to talk through a strategy of how to feel safe enough to go vote.  We came up with plan for him to dress in an outfit that feels tough, like armor.  He also was grateful for the info re looking up early voting locations and was going to see if he could go to place less intensely red.  So sad he couldn‚Äôt think of anyone to give him support around it.

Content: Ahh! I got a first-time voter who needed voting info. I was definitely fumbling a bit through this call but managed to get him the info he needed before he ended it. I've been doing great with text banking but calling the first time feels so much different haha
