Content: Hi <@1246315670669365311> thank you for sharing this information. Unfortunately I have to remove your post because it links to a PAC page with a "contribute" button. but hopefully <@1283943183830487139> will find Postcards to Swing Stages and many other postcard and letter writing events on [**mobilize.us**](https://www.mobilize.us/?country=US&q=write&state=WA)
