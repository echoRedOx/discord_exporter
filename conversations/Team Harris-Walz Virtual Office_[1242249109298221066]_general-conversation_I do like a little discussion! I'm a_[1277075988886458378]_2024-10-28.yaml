  content: good point! from the training today it also seems that texting is a little
    more paint by numbers so to speak, which might make it a bit easier. with phone
    you have to be a little more responsive to waht hte person is saying, a little
    more room to shorten a script if the person's attention seems like it's waning,
    etc.

  content: Totally - I think texting is really helpful in reminding people to register
    to vote, but phone is better for having real conversations!

  content: yeah I can see how each one would be better for different purposes! seems
    to me reminder-type stuff would be best over text. persuasion is more a phone
    thing in my (limitedly informed at this point) view
