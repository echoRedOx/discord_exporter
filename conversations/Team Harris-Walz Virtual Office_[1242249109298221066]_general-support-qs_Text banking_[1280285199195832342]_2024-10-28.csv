I’ve had people some of them rude. Mention the way that I sound when I talk and I am hoping that there maybe a text bank I can do instead of phone calls banking?

Calls can be tough for many people (I sill get anxious making them). If you are interested in trying out text banking, you can sign up for a training session here: https://events.democrats.org/event/672393/"
