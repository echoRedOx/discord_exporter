Content: Essentially the headline.

Called several people today, had some good talks some hang ups... but recently a lot of my calls have gone 'unheard'. Even had someone say "I'm on a national do not call list" but I couldn't even be heard!

Content: Hi Thomas! Are you using one or two devices? Sometimes using two can be a little more consistent with audio

Content: Was using one device. How would you recommend using two? I was using my phone to call and stay connected.

Content: Do you have a laptop or tablet in addition to your phone? You can connect to the dialer on the larger device and then use your phone for audio.

Content: When you first join the dialer, it will ask if you want to "Call with this device" or "Call with this device + phone for audio". If you pick the second, it will walk you through connecting your phone to the dialer ðŸ™‚

Content: Unfortunately, not all on the same network. I have a desktop that is wired, and my phone is on the network.

Content: I don't think it has to be on the same network - I think it calls your phone and uses that for audio but not your phone number. But check in tomorrow - there are lots of Mods with more expertiese than me on this one ðŸ™‚

Content: Thomas, I always use two devices and I can assure you don't need to share the network. You could call from a land line, it wouldn't matter so long as your using scale to win on the computer. Sometimes I also have issues where they can't hear me. Sometimes they are faking it and the reason I know that is because I learned some tricks. If it happens more than 3x in a row, just disconnect your phone (hang up) and restart the session.
