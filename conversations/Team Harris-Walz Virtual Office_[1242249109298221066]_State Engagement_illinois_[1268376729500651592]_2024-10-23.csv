Last night debate was good! Trump showed his true self and when someone shows you who they are, BELIEVE IT. BELIEVE THEM. We all know our assignment. Vote BLUE all the way to the ballot box 🗳️🇺🇸💙

Trump never answered the debate questions. He didn't speak on his policies/plans for the future.  What he did do was attack America with fear, (crime, illegal border crossing, racism, division, discord, chaos, economy collapse, people eating dogs and cats, etc...). 
The world 🌎 will not collapse. America 🇺🇸 will NOT fall apart as Trump spoke. Trump attacked America, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and others. Not one good thing did he speak on how to make America great. 
When we fight we win!"

A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

I'm a board member with Project XV and I could sure use some help. My ask is related to this campaign, too.

This year marks 154 years since the enactment of Amendment XV (African American suffrage); 104 years since Amendment XIX (women’s suffrage); And 60 years since Amendment XXIV (abolish poll tax).

On Election Day, we’re asking thousands of people to help us publicize the history of voting rights in our country by posting a selfie on Facebook or Instagram with the note that “My right to vote was a FIGHT to vote” and tag @projectXVmuseum.

Can you help us reach out to folks in IL? We need to make sure that the public history of suffrage remains in our collective memory, and your help is essential to this work.

P.S., We do lots of voter registrations drives and would love volunteers (or curious cats)!
