Content: Question: is the donation function on the Harris/Walz campaign website working properly? I tried to donate weekly, but it's just showing up as a one-time donation on Act Blue. I would've just changed my existing monthly donation to weekly, but for some reason Act Blue wouldn't let me do that.
