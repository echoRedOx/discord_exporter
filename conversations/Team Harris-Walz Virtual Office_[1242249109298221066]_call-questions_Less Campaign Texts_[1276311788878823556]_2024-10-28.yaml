  content: <@1272730128006254675> Hey Dylan, that is a good question and concern.
    The best answer I can give you is to tell those folks to respond "STOP" to the
    fundraising/campaign texts. Believe me, I get inundated with all these texts and
    calls and there really is not much we can do other than telling them to respond
    with "STOP".

  content: <@372194330213089281> We are working around the clock to  improve our communications
    infrastructure. As someone on the staff at Wilmington HQ, I do not do much collaboration
    with PACs in terms of outreach/facilitating phone banks. They also can access
    public voter files and contact these folks via text/call on their own accord as
    an organization. I can speak on the DNC, in that we are a growing team, and lately
    have been able to help each other free up capacity to improve our processes.

  content: I gotta say, I wish there were a better answer to this.   Personally, I
    don't get bent out of shape by the texts, but I can imagine for some of our fellow
    citizens, the volume is causing anxiety, disgust, and frustration.

  content: I appreciate your response. No real judgement coming from over here but
    I can completely understand why people would be turned off by the bombardment
    of texts (and emails) coming in. I've wondered if it's turning off potential voters.
    Hopefully once this election is over there will be space to reflect and streamline
    communications for future elections.

    but I expect others would be put off by it. I do wonder if we are helping though
