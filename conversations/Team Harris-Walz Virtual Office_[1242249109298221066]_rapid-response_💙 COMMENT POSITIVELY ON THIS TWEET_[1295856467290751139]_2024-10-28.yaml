  content: "Today, Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are announcing a plan for\
    \ rural America. The key elements will:\n\n-Increase access to affordable and\
    \ high-quality health care in rural communities\u2014by adding 10,000 health care\
    \ professionals, expanding telemedicine, cutting the number of ambulance deserts\
    \ in half.\n\n-Support the sandwich generation to care for elders at home, lowering\
    \ the cost of childcare and increasing the number of providers, and expanding\
    \ the Child Tax Credit to provide tax cuts up to $6,000 for families with newborns.\n\
    \n-Lower the costs of buying a home, starting and expanding a business, and raising\
    \ a family\u2014by sparking the construction of 3 million new housing units, providing\
    \ up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, increasing\
    \ the small business tax deduction for startup expenses 10-fold to $50,000.\n\n\
    -Invest in the future of American agriculture by boosting access to credit, land,\
    \ and markets, building new markets and streams of income for small- and mid-sized\
    \ farmers and producers, and supporting the rise of the next generation of American\
    \ farmers and ranchers.\n\nDonald Trump will turn back the hard-earned progress\
    \ that rural communities are making. As President, he tried to repeal the Affordable\
    \ Care Act and vows to terminate it if reelected, stripping protections from people\
    \ with pre-existing conditions and devastating rural hospitals and care services.\
    \ He will ban abortion nationwide, threaten access to contraception and IVF, and\
    \ force states to monitor women\u2019s pregnancies and report women\u2019s miscarriages\
    \ and abortions to the federal government."
