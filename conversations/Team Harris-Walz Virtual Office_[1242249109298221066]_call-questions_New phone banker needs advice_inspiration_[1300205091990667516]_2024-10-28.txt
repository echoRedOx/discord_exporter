Content: Please share your best advice for a new phone banker.  What do you wish you knew when you started?  I feel like others could do this so much better than I am doing it. Don't want to stop, but would love tips on scripts/engagement/etc. Are there any sample calls to look at anywhere?

Content: I'm told you don't have to say the rambling part at the end (This call was paid forâ€¦) as long as you've introduced yourself as a volunteer for the dems clearly at the beginning. Makes it WAY less awkward

Content: Also: humor helps. I've asked folx if they love all the awkward political calls as much as I love making them and a lot of people will soften up after that

Content: Unfortunately we don't have any sample calls. The best advice I can give is to make the script your own, don't try to read it verbatim. Ask questions, let the voters express themselves, and tell them why you're supporting Harris.  As you make more calls, the more comfortable you'll become.

Content: I love that. I am feeling so awkward. I'm sure that does not help. Good call with the ice breaker!

Content: When you get into the zoom meeting, go to the rehearsal room after the training to practice and familiarize yourself with the script. Success looks like helping people make a plan to vote, and giving people more information about Harris. You don't have to argue with Maga or rude people. Just tell them you have another call and say good night!

Content: In the end it's just a conversation, and it doesn't need to be perfect. In fact, it's probably better if it's *not* perfect. Our opponents have plenty of machines and bots at work for them: we have people, and it's that human touch that really convinces people. Remember, a lot of people are feeling much more... *isolated* from actual connection to other citizens because of the current media environment. So many things are curated or summarized or depersonalized in one way or another.

On top of all of this, this is a pure numbers game. The more calls we get out, the more people we reach, the more likely it is we reach some of the few undecided voters out there, or some of the disaffected, exhausted dems out there. Your calls are calls that wouldn't have been made were it not for your effort! So tap into your courage and dive in!
