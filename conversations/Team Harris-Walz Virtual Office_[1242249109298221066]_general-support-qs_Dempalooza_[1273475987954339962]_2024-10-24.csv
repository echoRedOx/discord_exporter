First, I want to say how grateful I am to be in this fight with you all. I will work on sharing more positive interactions, but please know that I scroll through the backend of HelpScout and Scale to Win every single day, and whether it be making sure supporters are able to access virtual events, or ensuring someone knows all their options for how to donate, y'all are making a difference in this election. You should all feel very proud for taking on some of the hardest texts and emails to respond to! This work requires a lot of attention to detail and care, and y'all are doing great! 

Second, if you signed up to help out during Dempalooza next week, you should have received an email to our meeting tonight. We will be using the Google Meet that is in your email invite tonight at 7:30PM. **Please privately message me if you have not received this. ** If you are helping out during Dempalooza but will not be able to join us, please reach out to me also. If you have not signed up but are interested in joining us, please sign up here: https://forms.gle/t7U8CehRWb2VgnDo6

Next, you will notice there are a few more channels under Digital Correspondence. 
<#1270106354115285022> and <#1270411579065897021> are forum channels. **Please do not edit anything here. ** You will be able to find FAQ, the volunteer report, and platform guides under these channels. Double check these before you ask a question the question channels. 

This brings me to my last point! Moving forward, we ask that you use the <#1272985533525659752> and <#1272985384279740607> channels to ask questions about conversations. This will allow me to keep the team channels clear so it's easier for y'all to find the latest campaigns and email guidance. 

Thank you all for your cooperation as we continue to build this program -- Y'all are the best!"
