  content: I honestly don't recall, If it's the one I'm thinking of I think I may
    have gotten halfway through and something happened and I got booted (perhaps bad
    signal) then I couldn't get back in. I could be wrong (I'm in several training
    & zooms) I also work on dives/campaigns. Hard to keep track lol. I'll sign up
    for the Saturday one. Thank you!

  content: "Hi,  Thx for creating this thread & supporting <#1250550849998946417>\
    \ community.\n\nI spend time in <#1260333091319451660> .  It seems some users\
    \ can see Community Notes (CN\u2019s) at the regular tweet link & others do not,\
    \ like myself.  It was recommended by another user & I re-posted the use of //x.com/i/birdwatch/t/\
    \ along w/the tweet ID added to the end to see CN\u2019s.  Should we encourage\
    \ those who create CN's, when possible, to post both the original tweet link &\
    \ the birdwatch recommendation and/or link?\n\nWhen directed to CN\u2019s, I often\
    \ see several CN\u2019s posted.  Even though I read all CN\u2019s and use my own\
    \ discretion as to which ones are helpful or not.  Should we encourage CN creators\
    \ to somehow highlight (screenshot or repeat - cut/paste) their content so we\
    \ know which ones are coming from them?  It would save time not having to vote\
    \ on multiple CN's and focus on the ones coming from this community, not to mention\
    \ it would increase thier \"helpful\" numbers if the other CN's from random contributors\
    \ recieved less votes.\n\nI have been voting on CN\u2019s for a little bit now.\
    \  Is there any follow up when a CN gets approved and becomes visible?  I am starting\
    \ to feel like my efforts are not making an impact.\n\nI\u2019ve seen users who\
    \ are also replying to tweets along w/voting on or creating CN\u2019s.  Should\
    \ it be recommended to post links to those replies as they can get buried and\
    \ hard to find amongst the many replies?  It would make it easier to support those\
    \ efforts.  Should it be encouraged that anyone replying to tweets do the same\
    \ and if so, where should they post that as it wouldn't actually be a CN?\n\n\
    Lastly, I may have missed some follow up but there may have been some efforts\
    \ made on behalf of the communities needs here:\n\nJay Eilers - TX\n\uFFFC\n09/09/2024\
