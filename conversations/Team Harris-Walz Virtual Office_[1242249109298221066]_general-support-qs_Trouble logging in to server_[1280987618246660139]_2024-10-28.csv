In adding 2FA I had a glitch with my pw manager and have lost my discord pw and I can't change the pw without the current.  
I tried logging in from my phone (on a Mac here) and the Authy app seemed to get me in, but not on any channels.  Team H-W shows up, but says I'm in a weird space with no channel access.  
1) How do I get back on channels?
2) How do I change my pw without a current one?"

You can close and lock this thread, which I still haven't figured out."
