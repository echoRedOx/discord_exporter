Content: Having trouble with Discord today.  I put my phone number in yesterday prior to cutoff and today it is telling me I have to verify my phone number but when I do that it sends me an error message that it’s connected to another account.  I followed the steps that were in <#1267941954243526756> in Discord.  But when trying to log in with my phone number it says my account has been disabled.  So, I tried to create a new account with a different email address but now I’m not authorized to do that due to getting a 401 error when entering my birthday which is 11-29-1952.   If my account has been disabled how can I get it back in use and why would it be disabled?   I have been using both my laptop and the Discord App on phone.  What next

Content: Hello <@1278027471672836222> I will be available to look at this with you on a Zoom screenshare today between 3pm and 6pm, and after 8pm eastern time today.

My view says your account is verified, and you could only post this message if you are verified, but we can talk about that later today.

Content: Ok.  I used my husband’s phone number just to get verified but now my phone number and my email are incorrect.  When we zoom
 I will be using chat because I am nonverbal.    I am available at 3 today if you are.
