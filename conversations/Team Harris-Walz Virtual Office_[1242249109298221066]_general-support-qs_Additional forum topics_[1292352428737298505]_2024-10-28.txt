Content: I was thrilled to find the climate change channel !  Would some additional ones be added dedicated to various social media be valuable ? 

All of my many nieces and nephews get the majority of their news from there, so it's important.  

We could then have discussions about videos like the one I reposted to the gen. discussion from climate, and others, and also coordinate actions.

Content: Hi <@1291523703137632302> we do have some social media channels, you can find them in Amplifying Messaging. to get there you need to go to Channels and Roles and pick Engage your Online Communities. then you will see this channel https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1260651617867399188 and in there you will choose the emoji reaction to get access to the Tiktok, Reddit, and Twitter community notes channel.

Content: There are a lot of folks posting on Threads (IG) but there isn't a specific channel for that. And the campaign FB is managed outside of this server.

Content: And encourage your nieces and nephews to join the Discord. the volunteer activities are more enjoyable/interesting than chat scrolling.

Content: Trying -- not sure if they all truly comprehend what is at stake in the election. At least they'll vote, I'm told. üíô
