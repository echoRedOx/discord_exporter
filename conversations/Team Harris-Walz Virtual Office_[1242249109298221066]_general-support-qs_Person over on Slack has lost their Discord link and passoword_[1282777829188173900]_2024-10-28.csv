It sounds like this person has already tried recovering lost passwords. The only real option I can think of to recommend is to have them create a new Discord account with a different email address. Once that is done, they can rejoin the Virtual Office and then would have to reach out to the staffers for whichever teams they're on to get permissions for those teams with this new account."
