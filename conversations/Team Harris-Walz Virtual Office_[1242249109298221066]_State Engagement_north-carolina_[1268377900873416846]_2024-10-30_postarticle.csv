In North Carolina, these could be things like:
•    Provide better work protections for construction, maintenance and landscape workers.
•    Require guns in homes to be under lock and key.
•    Provide a tax cut for working families with a state earned income tax credit
•    Increase rural access to medical, dental and mental health services.
History shows that Republicans are unlikely to support such things.
In the United States, it could be things like:
•    Increase funding to detect, research and combat sickle cell disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, and other health issues that disproportionately affect Blacks.
•    Provide forgivable loans for disadvantaged people to start businesses.
•    Expand forgiving education loans for teaching, public service and healthcare jobs.
History shows that Republicans are unlikely to support such things.
GETTING EVERYONE TO VOTE IS ESSENTIAL – Key voting information:
•    Voter ID required to vote
•    Registering/early voting – You can still register and vote at the same time in person during early voting: 10/17 – 11/2. Find out where/when: https://vt.ncsbe.gov/EVSite/
•    Voting by mail: 10/29 is the last day to request an absentee ballot. 
•    Election Day is 11/5: 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM
PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE YOU KNOW AND ASK THEM TO DO THE SAME.
THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR ANY AND ALL EFFORTS."

A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.
