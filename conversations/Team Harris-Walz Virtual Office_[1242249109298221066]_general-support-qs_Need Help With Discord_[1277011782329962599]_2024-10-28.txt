Content: My wife has been through the texting training and has completed the forms and is ready to start texting but is having problems getting on the Team Harris-Walz channel. When she signs into Discord it looks like an old account. Can someone help us with this? Her name is "Melissa Black [Colorado]". Thanks.

Content: Hi Michael! As promised, tagging <@568257600228032512> here for when she's on later. In the meantime, I've been casually told by another off-duty mod who is more fluent in discord the following, could try it:

That usually happens when multiple people share 1 computer to log into things, OR if the user has tried to log into discord from more than 1 device and accidentally created 2 accounts

Content: We're on two separate computers. She was doing fine the other night during training and thereafter until today. Today she has tried logging out of the one account and logging in to the other but it says the email/password is incorrect when she does that.

Content: So we do that with the Zoom trainings but not the discord. It's just the one link to get into the discord, which is different from the Zoom.

Content: But when she logs out of that account and tries to log in to her new account it says the password is wrong. However - she is using the same email so if she says "Forgot Password" or whatever and she goes through all that to change it and then logs in again it just takes her to original account. I mean - she is IN Discord just not where she was the other night and with a different user name and an old profile photo.

Content: Discord doesn't allow any user to use the same email for two different accounts. So that's where I'm confused and thinking it's something different.

Content: So this is a known issue apparently all over reddit and the discord support boards don't answer it because discord hasn't been great about responding to it. Some users claim that the best thing is to unlink and relink the phone number to re-verify the account with that email. 

Beyond this, Carolyn may have to help when she gets in tonight around 12p ET.

Content: Hi! Discord usually lets you know that you've used the same phone number on a new account and that the phone is disconnected from the other account.
I can dig into this further. Are you using Discord in the browser or the Discord desktop app, or on mobile?

Content: Discord in the browser. She completed the training earlier this week - did the little reports/exams/whatever - and received the DM on Discord the other night but then could not use the message field to respond. I forget what it said exactly but it had something to do with registering I think? Her username was consistent with Scale to Win and everything looked good to go but she couldn't respond to her DM for some reason. And then today she logged into Discord and went back to what appeared to be an old account with an old profile photo and old channels. Can she be looked up somehow? "Melissa Black [Colorado]".

Content: Clear your browsing history (or switch to a browser that you have never used for Discord) power-cycle your PC and maybe your WiFi box too. Then go back to Discord and login with the new account.

Content: So that is because it's an announcements only channel but she should have access now to what she needs. We highly recommend she go to <#1268398483841220649> and <#1268398608097476750> which really help orient to our server and workflow, now that she's in.
