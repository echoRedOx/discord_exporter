  content: I'm all set up to text. But during training I was told a laptop is preferred
    to a tablet. Tablet is more convenient for me. Is there a big difference?

  content: "Started to write a long message about difference between Discord app on\
    \ iPad and laptop, but really the issue is Spoke. One of the BIG problems is that\
    \ people on the mobile app (so, I believe this is probably true for the tablet,\
    \ haven't checked) cannot see tags as easily. We are finding A LOT of people who\
    \ neglect to tag conversations correctly. It may also be more difficult to see\
    \ all the survey responses and canned replies. \n\nSo basically, texters are making\
    \ mistakes in their conversations due in part to using a mobile device rather\
    \ than a desktop/laptop. This creates a lot of work for us mods on the back end\
    \ of things...also will create a lot of feedback to texters."

  content: Thank you for the great explanation! I will see what things look like on
    my tablet, and if I can't find the tags I'll switch to desktop. I  used my tablet
    in 2020 without problems, but maybe things are different now.
