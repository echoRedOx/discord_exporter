  content: "I\u2019m not really sure where to post this, but I travelled to Milwaukee\
    \ for one event yesterday and two events today. The event yesterday was cancelled\
    \ with little notice and the one at 6:00pm today was cancelled, as well, but I\
    \ still received a text yesterday about whether I was planning to attend tonight.\
    \ I was also told that I could attend canvassing today from 7:00-9:00am or 12:00-2:00pm,\
    \ but evidently the 12:00-2:00pm was cancelled as well. I\u2019m really trying\
    \ to help this campaign, but it\u2019s challenging when it\u2019s that unorganized."

    \ feeling discouraged and let down by the campaign when you are doing so much\
    \ to support it. The logistics for Harris/Walz campaign stops are last minute\
    \ arrangements due to security concerns. Our virtual platform doesn't get this\
    \ info either. \nThe issues with canvassing should be shared with your local dems\
    \ office. They are open today.\n2999 S. Delaware St. Ave\nMilwaukee, WI 53221\n\
