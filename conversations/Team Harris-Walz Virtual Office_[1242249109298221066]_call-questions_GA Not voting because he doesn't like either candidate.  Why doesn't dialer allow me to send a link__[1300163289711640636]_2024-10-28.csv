Just spent (way) too long on the phone with someone who isn’t going to vote but every issue he brought up was pro Harris and anti Trump.  I wanted to send him the kamalaharris.com link but wasn’t given the opportunity in the dialer.  I tagged him “not voting” and then “undecided” on the next screen, but it didn’t give me a link to provide additional information.  Did I miss something?"

Your selections are right and in this case it would be up to him to visit the issues page on his own.  I hope your conversation convinced him to reconsider not voting.  Its mindboggling right?"

His biggest concern was that the government makes decisions without input from the electorate!  And he mentioned the 1%ers and homelessness, etc.  I'm so worried for this country!  Thanks Denise!!!  Back to calling and texting..."
