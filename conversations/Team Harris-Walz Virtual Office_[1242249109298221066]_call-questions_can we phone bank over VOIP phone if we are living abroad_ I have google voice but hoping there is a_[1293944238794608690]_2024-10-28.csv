When you sign up for a phonebank, or when you come here to calls-team on Discord, you will be given access to our Dialer.  The Dialer opens in a browser window on your computer or tablet.  It searches a list of phone numbers for a good connection, then feeds you a call that has already been answered on the other end.  The called person sees a local phone number.   So your phone service does not have to be involved in the call at all.  There is an option to use your own phone for audio, but even in that case you dial  a phone number once to connect your audio, and the dialer works as above.  

So I think the short answer to your question is that the Dialer has an integrated VOIP system."
