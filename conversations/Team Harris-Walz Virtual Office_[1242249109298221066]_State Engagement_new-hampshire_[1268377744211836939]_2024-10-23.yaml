    \ speak and to volunteer. I\u2019m mostly doing online stuff with this distributed\
    \ organizing team this year from home, but depending on how things go I may come\
    \ up to NH to help (or at least tell my parents to). I\u2019ve also signed up\
    \ to work on the NH voter protection hotline from home. Anyway, just here to say\
    \ hi for now! I\u2019ve already been to the Manchester and Nashua offices once\
    \ and done a couple NH virtual discussion events so have met some people, but\

  content: Gov. Sununo has a bill on his desk that will make an original birth cert
    or passport required for same-day registration and eliminates affidavits to waive
    the requitlrement. It's unclear if he'll sign it in time for it to be in place
    for Nov, but it's something to watch. When We All Vote is a nationwide group founded
    by Michelle Obama (I think) that targets young voters. I'm not sure which state
    level organizations are specifically working this. Maybe 603Forward?

    \ morning that the event is already full and closed to new signups. So I\u2019\
    m not sure what this mobilize link is but my understanding is that you had to\
    \ have filled out the more detailed google form they sent with the invite in order\
    \ to get on the list. I do hope it\u2019s a bit more than a tarmac stop but I\u2019\
    ll take what I can get \U0001F600"

  content: "Even those of us who were invited and on the list do not have the location.\
    \ I believe they are announcing that very last minute for security reasons. In\
    \ terms of invites, it seems like they were sent directly by local democratic\
    \ parties and campaign offices, probably to frequent volunteers first. I\u2019\
    m guessing/wondering if the event is on the smaller side because there was never\
    \ a public link like there were with the big rallies. I\u2019m so happy she is\
    \ taking NH seriously and hopefully she will be back again at least once!"

  content: "Spent the day door knocking in Windham / Salem today. Some observations:\
    \ \n\n- We are still in voter identity time. This means we are looking for people\
    \ have been voters in the past and who were unaffiliated, or who have voted Democrat\
    \ in the past, but may not be diehard Dems. This is very common in NH. \n- There\
    \ were a lot of voters who were undecided. Speaking to voters is very important.\
    \ Marile was great at talking about Project 2025, I pushed that VP Harris was\
    \ in New Hampshire last week speaking about her Economic Plan and the local news\
    \ have done a great deal of coverage of the event. (Thankfully, NH has a lot of\
    \ very active local newspapers). \n- Yes, there were some Tr-mp supporters (mostly\
    \ men) who answered the door and wouldn't give the wives space to speak. There\
    \ were also men who just didn't answer the door, despite us seeing them inside.\
    \ Yes, I would rather speak to the obnoxious Tr-mp voter who literally shouted\
    \ at us. At least he told me who he was. He didn't intimidate me, and frankly,\
    \ he looked very small next to his big truck. \n- Favorite homes? The small family\
    \ farmer whose 4 people in the household would be supporting Kamala Harris ...\
    \ I picked up some local honey from her farm stand. And the woman who had just\
    \ come home from a vacation in the Poconos and was thrilled to see me with my\
    \ Kamala Harris and NH Democrats literature. \"Thank goodness you are here!\"\
    \ \n- It felt great to walk and knock. We need more door knockers. We are going\
    \ to be finishing Voter ID time and moving into persuasion time soon. And we need\
    \ YOU to knock knock knock."

  content: 'Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House
    with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from
    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
    MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks
    is crucial.
