Content: I'm not trained as a KC, but I was helping out with a reshifting list, which after it finished pointed me at: "H4H Recruitment_101224_ Type: Recruitment". I'm delighted to work on that, but I'm not sure I've been approriately trained to answer possible questions from hosts. Where should I ask about this?

Content: Hi Jesse- have you participated in phone banks? The biggest things people need to know are that we have a whole crew to support them and they can reach out to us via email or Discord.
