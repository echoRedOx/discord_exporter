This presents a problem when trying to move forward in the call to see if they want polling info. I suspect they are pro Harris, because they take the call and talk to me comfortably, and one said she would volunteer for the dems! I would liek to click lean-harris in these situations. Or can we add a ""do not want to disclose"" option so that we can move forward with data about polling places?"

""Undecided"" would also be a good option.  If they are coded as undecided, they will likely get another call, but will not be counted in the ""Harris"" category for prediction purposes.  I will post the debrief form link in calls-team"
