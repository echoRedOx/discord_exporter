  content: "In a 2006 interview with the Daily News, Walz said he represents what\
    \ it means to come up from the \u201Cgrass roots.\u201D He was part of a class\
    \ of 25 who graduated from Butte High School in 1982, where grasslands were plentiful.\n\
    \nWalz said his biggest claim to fame in high school was that he was named to\
    \ the Norfolk Daily News\u2019 Top 20 All Area football team. His senior year,\
    \ the Butte Wildcats went 8-1 and the basketball team went 16-4.\n\n\u201CIt was\
    \ K-12 all in one building (in Butte) and during summers we worked on the farm,\u201D\
    \ Walz said. \u201CI still have great friends from there. People in that graduating\
    \ class ended up very successful. Nebraska has gotten a lot of criticism for not\
    \ consolidating a lot of schools, but I believe that small classrooms and teaching\
    \ in small classes has helped with the work ethic.\n\n\u201CThere are a lot of\
    \ successful people who have come from the small classrooms all over Nebraska.\
    \ You didn\u2019t get lost in the shuffle. Every student was an individual whose\
    \ voice mattered.\u201D"
