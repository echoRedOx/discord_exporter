  content: 'Hi <@1067615211432988684> you can see the trainging you signed up for
    if you have used the same email to sign up for each training. Go to https://events.democrats.org
    and click the 3-line menu in the upper-right, log in with the email you used when
    you signed up for trainings, the click the 3-line menu and select "my schedule".

    Some teams provide a schedule sheet showing when their volunteers are doing shifts.
    I don''t know if Vote Team does this. You can ask in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1270925721895698482
    if you have access to that channel. If you can''t access that channel, you are
    probably not on-boarded yet and you will get a message with more info once you
    are on-boarded.'
