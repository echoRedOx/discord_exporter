    both in person phone banks and virtual phone banks. Would love to fold into the
    campaign infrastructure if someone could help with this?


    We also have a number of house parties that are meant to drive commitments and
    donations. We built a toolkit for this, but would be great to align with any tools
    the campaign already has. Thanks!'

  content: I'm so sorry, unfortunately - due to campaign finance laws - we can't mention
    any kind of fundraising for any groups (that aren't the three DNC official ones,
    even if they raise funds for those groups). You can say group name, just don't
    encourage donations/fundraising. You can resend your message after I remove it
    for compliance with the law, just remove the money parts. Thank you for helping
    us stay compliant.

    i am seeing on social media platforms and when talking to  Maga republicans that
    are on the fence and undecided voters in real time  they want to know why  the
    website doesn't show Our Policies.  to them  it makes it look like we are hiding
    something.   Their issue is that some of them don't have social media or no longer
    trust post on social media  do to misinformation  to view what we are posting.    SO
    ...  is there an ear we can bend top encourage them to put OUR policies on the
    website.?

  content: Am I being a worrywart? I subscribe to Native news online because I am
    half Native American. The disrespect shown the Native community by Tim Sheehy
    in Montana hasn't even been addressed by the Harris/Walz campaign. And that senate
    seat is crucial to keeping the democratic senate. Harris and Walz need to (even
    briefly) appear on that reservation and the campaign needs to see that the Native
    vote is not being taken for granted or we'll lose the senate and be hamstrung
    by republicans. Again. How do I get the attention of someone who can get this
    message to the Campaign managers?

    a bit and keep an eye on it, the replies button will activate because someone
    has released their texts and people are still replying. However, if you're experiencing
    this a lot and are worried you might need help, you should ask in <#1259238714157305936>

  content: <@1278397446246109265> There is a small group of people here in Florida
    that not only are trying to eliminate mail-in ballots, but they want to eliminate
    early voting and require that all voters own property in Florida. They have been
    agitating for years. I tangled with one of these people at a festival a few months
    ago. They are extremely vocal, but few people in power listen to them. While the
    group stopped short of instituting a poll tax, the one member I met felt strongly
    that a poll tax was necessary to maintain the integrity of the vote. Keep in mind
    that more Republicans than Democrats use mail-in voting in Florida.

  content: Hi <@1190850265981657178> - As far as merch and donation go, we can only
    direct folks to https://store.kamalaharris.com/ and donations to https://secure.actblue.com/donate/web-hfp-september-2024.  It
    is critical to maintain the integrity of sending the funds directly to the campaign.
    However, if during a watch party, you want to challenge people to donate $1 or
    $5 every time a word or phrase is uttered or something silly happens, that might
    be a good idea. I hope that helps. I am sure you have some good ideas.  Thanks
    for your patience.

  content: Hi, I need a Harris/Walz list for a postcard party I'm hosting this Saturday.
    I  ordered 100 postcards from thecivicscenter.org and stamps for a postcard party
    that I'd planned to host on Sept.28.  I got sent a list that was aimed at encouraging
    new voters in Pennsylvania to register by Oct.20.  However, I didn't realize it
    would be a non-partisan list.  I only want my efforts to benefit the Harris campaign.  What
    is the best way to get a list of addresses aimed at reaching Harris voters?

  content: 'Hi <@347053610317774849> ... I have been using either Bit.ly or Canva
    to create QR codes (both free resources). I actually just used Canva to create
    flyers that fit 4/(8.5x11) page, then asked a local print shop to cut after printing!


    Alternatively (bc printing gets expensive!) I''ve seen groups print only a few
    color flyers, which they put in reusable holders and swap out if/when needed.


    Hope that helps, good luck with your event!'

    have too much to do today.  I attended Camp Kamala on Saturday where they asked
    us to host watch parties, so I had very little turnaround time. It would be a
    nice feature in the future.

  content: 'Hello, <@1274514859261825095>! Thank you so much for hosting an event!
    If you''d like to do postcards at your event, you will need to connect with an
    outside source as the campaign does not do them. Would you consider hosting your
    phone bank instead of postcards? Phone banking is the single most impactful thing
    you can do outside of a battleground state! We have lots of help and training
    available for phone bank hosts, too! Here''s some more info:

    captains training last week. I know that the next step is to be a shadow captain.
    Where can i find a list of dates and times to sign up? Thanks.

    do not think you are added yet. so I will screenshot and post it for you.  They
    have the info for the shadow shifts for both chat and data captains. Welcome,
    I am data captain for zoom phone banks.  Also, please check your email.  There
    should be info there as well.

    has both Griz & Cat fans in it, it's referred to as "A House Divided." So it might

    it, it seems like the algorithm is not picking it up.  I tried just using a picture
    and putting the link in the comments, not mentioning Harris/Walz by name in the
    post, etc.  but it still seems like it's not getting much traffic.  Any suggestions?

    Content Brigade. Most of the work is by assignment based on what the campaign
    needs in the moment, but they also take ideas from team members and assess for

    they like so worth a shot if you''re also willing to work on their project requests:

    is my best guess. My wife (good planner) and I (good at tech) are in Santa Barbara,
    CA, and are considering organizing an Oct26 carpool/bus from SB to Las Vegas to
    knock on doors. E.g. https://events.democrats.org/c/surge_carpools-for-kamala-to-nv/event/create/  The
    closest buses leave from LA, and we think there's a busload from SB that we might
    be able to organize. Who can I DM or talk to about how this works? Need a lot
    of info fast to decide if this is feasible.
