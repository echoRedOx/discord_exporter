Content: I shadowed a ZPB yesterday and wondered about next steps. Not sure if I closed out before a form may have been sent at end but was there for 2 hours. Would love to help wherever needed during phone banks when I need to recharge from making calls, helping others make them. Thank you!

Content: I originally said facilitator but I am open to anywhere I'm needed most. Since I'm a discord mod here, I've already helped a lot in ZPB chats offering support (similar to the resources we provide as mods).

Content: By help, when there were breakout rooms and no chat captain showed up, I helped answer vol Qs. Tech issues w/ Zoom were going on I believe.

Content: Do we have a list of resources (links and FAQs) to refer to and paste into chat? Also open to facilitating if needed, but would love to go over the slides first to practice getting the hang of it, even though I've been in many of them and know the "spiel".

Content: This is what I needed, thank you! I do have the channels as a mod but our perms changed so could be missing some/one. I do see calls-team-mod-resources so I'll go check there too. Anything else to point me to that's vital, I'm all ears.
