  content: In slack I can see a list of all my mentions, so I can go to one place
    to easily see if & where I've been tagged - does Discord have a similar function?
    I keep seeing my name tagged in messages when I scroll through old messages in
    a channel and I can't find any other way of actually knowing those mentions happened.
    Thank you!

  content: Hi Marcy, welcome! Yes, Discord has a similar function. If you look in
    the top right there will be a button to view your inbox which will show all of
    your mentions.
