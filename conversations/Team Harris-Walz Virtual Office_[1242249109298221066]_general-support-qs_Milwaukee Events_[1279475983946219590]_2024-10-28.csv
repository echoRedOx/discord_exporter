The event yesterday was cancelled with little notice and the one at 6:00pm today was cancelled, as well, but I still received a text yesterday about whether I was planning to attend tonight. I was also told that I could attend canvassing today from 7:00-9:00am or 12:00-2:00pm, but evidently the 12:00-2:00pm was cancelled as well. I’m really trying to help this campaign, but it’s challenging when it’s that unorganized."

The logistics for Harris/Walz campaign stops are last minute arrangements due to security concerns. Our virtual platform doesn't get this info either. 
The issues with canvassing should be shared with your local dems office. They are open today.
