I know that the call shifts are usually about two hours, but I've found that after about an hour, I'm not as effective as I could be. I've been trying to do an hour a day, but is it OK if I'm consistency only doing half of a full shift? I know its not ideal, but its the best I can do right now."

We appreciate any time you can give at all! If you are not staying until the end, you should ask for the debrief form in the chat to give your feedback."

We want you to be okay!
