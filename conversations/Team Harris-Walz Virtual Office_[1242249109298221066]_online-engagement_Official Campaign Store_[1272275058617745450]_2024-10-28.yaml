  content: Hi <@260982275506700288>. Thanks for the question. While I don't have that
    answer for you as we're focused on Online Engagement here, one of our <@&1245831457818279986>s
    may be able to assist you with an answer. (You can usually reach them through
    <#1242249109298221069> or <#1267941954243526756>.) In my experience shopping there,
    some sold out material did eventually return while other pieces did NOT.

    time keeping up. The same thing happened with Fetterman two years ago.

  content: Yes, Jessica and Marie are correct. They have various shipping dates for
    different items and many don't ship until September. Depends on the items. They
    likely do this to produce larger runs so the campaign gets to keep more money
    for campaigning rather than product. You might check the receipt and/or item/s
    on the website to see if it lists the shipping date/s. They often do.

    DNC uses it for the stuff they sell on the party's website since I have the donkey
    coffee cup from that.

  content: Like I said I have a feeling what's going on is something very similar
    to what the Fetterman campaign experienced in 2022 when they became so popular
    that their online store got slammed with orders that it took slightly longer than
    expected for a lot of items. Check back periodically. Also, if you get the Shop
    app on your phone, you can probably get notifications that way too because that's
    how I got a lot of notifications on DNC gear I ordered a few times.
