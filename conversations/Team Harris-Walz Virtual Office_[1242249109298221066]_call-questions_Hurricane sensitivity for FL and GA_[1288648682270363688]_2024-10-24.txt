Content: This is just an update for phonebank staff because I am living in the Atlanta, GA area. Please continue to encourage volunteers who are potentially contacting voters in Florida and Georgia to be sensitive and aware that those in this region have the hurricane and related weather on their minds. Both states have declared states of emergency for those affected and schools as far north as metro Atlanta have been closed Thursday and Friday to keep everyone safe on the roads during this time. Please remove this post as needed or share information somewhere else. (I wasn't sure where was best to post this as it wasn't really a phone banking question.) Thanks so much for reaching out to voters and volunteers and getting out the vote!

Content: I am in the Tampa Bay Area & have been phone banking today- DeSantis just eliminated Climate Change from Science Texts back in June. This is an excellent time to call folks.
