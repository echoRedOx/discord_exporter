There are lots of choices: answering machine, hostile, do not call etc. but if it's just ""not Joe"" what's next? Thank you in advance!"

If the person who answers says that the person you're looking for isn't at that number anymore, select ""wrong number."" Thanks!"

Every vote matters! 

I then explain I will call back for the other person too!"
