  content: Hi, I just got on and started making calls to Michigan. Is the purpose
    to get out the vote or to educate? The opening of the script is very long, and
    I'm wondering if it's ok if I jump right to "Do you have a plan to vote?"

  content: <@1057037857774121020> Most phone banks have a theme, like "voting plan"
    or "confirming volunteers" if you don't see anything obvious in the script, you
    can ask in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1263529508300914809
    and someone will know.
