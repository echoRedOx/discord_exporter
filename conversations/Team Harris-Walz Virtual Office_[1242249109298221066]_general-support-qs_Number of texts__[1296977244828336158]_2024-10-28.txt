Content: how can I find out in Discord or Spoke how many texts I've sent since I started volunteering? I'm working on multiple campaigns in Discord/Spoke and would love to have a sense of how many texts I've sent, replies I've fielded, etc. - where do I find that out? I think it will help me to know how much I've worked in certain states when the results start coming in... Thank you!
