  content: Hi Jessica -- Someone was asking for fact-checking on Tim  Walz's ties
    to a Muslim cleric. I can't find the message now, but maybe you've seen it? I
    thought it was on online-engagement. I did a search. MANY right-wing outlets reported
    on the supposed ties 3 days ago, e.g. Fox News https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-walz-ties-muslim-cleric-antisemitic-views-gave-state-funding-group-report
    Does not look like the ties are very direct. One time the cleric helped Walz calm
    protesters. Walz supported the Muslim community in many ways https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2024/08/06/five-faith-facts-tim-walz-lutheran-248512
    Perhaps someone can create a message about the true nature of the ties -- Walz
    did not support any anti-semitic views.
