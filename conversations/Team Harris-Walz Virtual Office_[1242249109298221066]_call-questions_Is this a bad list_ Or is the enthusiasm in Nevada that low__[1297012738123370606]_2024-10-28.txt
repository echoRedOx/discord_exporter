Content: I am calling this list: "Ready: Remaining Tiers_101824_NV_PT_type: dvc". 
Only hang-ups and people not interested. 
Must have made like 50 calls. One person was in the east coast and yelled at me for calling at 9:30 pm.

Content: I've called NV before last night, and I had similar issues. I'm not sure why so many people are actually located on the east coast or while they're answering unknown numbers if woken up from sleep!

Content: I think it's just the nature of the type of area Neveda & Las Vegas is - lots of movement in & out.
