Individually we can engage in whatever political conversations we choose to.   The rub comes when it relates to these other activities being linked to the official campaign.  That’s what we want to avoid.  


Even if the mission of these other initiatives are essential and the talking points are solid; the campaign cannot take on liability for it.

To that end, references and discussions of external platforms like that can only reside at https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1268426751164551199 within this server so that there is a clear delineation.

I had an interesting convo with Barry Moore. (Republican Congressman, District 1) Essentially, he told me he doesn't think abortion is healthcare, that people are being ""killed by woke"", and that kids are being pumped full of hormones that are giving them mental illnesses and destroying their bones (which he say, cannot be reversed. I'm assuming he's talking about gender affirming care. Also, this is not true. Some of it is fully reversible as I am aware. I'm no expert though and still researching for my video I'm making). He also told me that abortion clinics don't provide any other services (Which by that, I guess he's meaning Planned Parenthood?)

Just passing this along, since we've been talking about Alabama issues and he probably represents what people in the other camp really believe. I'm already making a video about this dude, and putting this convo with it. (Yes I have receipts, it was an email)"

What they don't get is that GMO isn't hormones it is a method to modify the actual food so that it has properties considered ""good"" for the product. That is a definite mixed bag of what is good and not good.  For example, our bananas are GMO - there is only ONE type of banana. Is that good - not really but it isn't bad for you to eat them.
