Content: Hi, I noticed some posts in the the <#1279085616247869451> channel where volunteers were discussing using apps to automate the clicking to approve phone numbers. Similarly for sending initial texts, as I was under the impression that automating the clicks was not allowed due to legal reasons. Can someone please clarify and address these messages as needed. Thanks!
