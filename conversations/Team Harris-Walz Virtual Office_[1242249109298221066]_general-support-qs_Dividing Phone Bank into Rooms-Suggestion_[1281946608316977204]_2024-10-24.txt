Content: Hello! Was Data Captain on a call that needed to be separated into experienced callers for one call link and new callers for the other. Experienced callers were asked to type “experienced” or a phone icon in the chat. These popped in amongst icebreaker and tech questions making it a slow process to move them into the correct room. Going forward could we ask them to raise hand in zoom instead of using chat to identify?

Content: <@1270562171050266725> This is something a team can discuss during the opening meeting before we start the zoom. Honestly, I feel like having them rename themselves to start with an E or an N would help us identify. Honestly, though, this sound slike when we initially have experienced callers put the phone icon in the chat for the dialer link, which doesn't require us to do anything other than post the dialer link.

Content: I would suggest bringing it up at the beginning of your next session to come to a consensus on how to handle it for your meeting. Everyone is starting to come up with their personal preferences and best practices.
