Content: Did you get an email after you registered that did come through, just saying they got your registration? Something that might have contact info?

Content: I won't get in. My friend showed me on her Instructions email that it clearly says besides showing ID you have to show the the  arrival instructions on this email, which  the actual instructions that shows on hers did not show u on mine. It was just the header that said Instructions for the Rally. I am really so mad about this.
