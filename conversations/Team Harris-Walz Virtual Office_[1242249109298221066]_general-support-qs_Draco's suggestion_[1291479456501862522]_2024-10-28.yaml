  content: I was thinking of ideas that would help AMerica. How about making a assist
    program to help Americans that are looking for work or new work. Move to new areas.
    This way companies posting jobs that the Local base does not have to fulfill these
    positions could be taken from other parts of the country and the cost to move
    and help finding new place can be setup by the program to help distribute jobs
    better <@766548745223405579>
