It seems like people just don’t have time to talk and listen to much at all or they’ll just hang up."

It’s required that you say you’re a volunteer (for Dems etc) and that you review the script to understand the purpose of the call and convey that.  But you don’t have to use the exact phrasing in the exact order and most callers personalize a bit and ad lib a bit as well.  Just please remember to stay positive and that people will associate you with Team Harris.

If you want to mention this in the <#1242256751445934262> channel, others will likely jump in and tell you how they personally work with this dilemma."

Just remember to say you’re a volunteer, stay positive, and know the goals of the call (like to recruit volunteers or to get out the vote).  Good luck!"
