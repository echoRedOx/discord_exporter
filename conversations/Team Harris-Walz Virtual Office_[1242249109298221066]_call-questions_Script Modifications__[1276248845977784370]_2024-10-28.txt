Content: The script for the phone bank seems to assume I belong to the Democratic Party.
I do not.  I am not affiliated with any party, and I'm typically conservative.

Is it kosher to start with "I'm calling on behalf of the Democratic Party" instead of "I'm WITH the Democratic Party"?
I think the fact that I do not affiliate with a party is beneficial for my conversation, particularly since I usually lean toward conservative.

What's the skinny on that?

Content: That sounds like an excellent rephrasing, still keeping it honest for you in particular. Good luck with your calls and thanks for all you're doing!

Content: Same, I usually say something like "calling for the Democrats" or "Calling on behalf of" and if the conversation leads there, I mention I'm actually registered Independent.

Content: Last night I had about 30% of the hangups before I got to [YOUR NAME], and the rest of them after I said "Democratic Party".

Content: I thought about calling like this.

"Hi I'm Thomas, I'm calling on behalf of America. Is this (insert name)"

That way they get a little bit of me in there, and sometimes if it's NOT the person I'm calling, maybe they'll still listen instead of immediately hang up?

Content: Hey! As someone who helps with running the phone banks, the line Iâ€™ve been given on this is that you can play with the script as much as you like, as long as you ask the bolded questions.
