  content: I took the training video and passed the quiz on 10/24. I made a scale
    to Win account too. But when I click on a text assignment link, Scale to Win gives
    me an error message saying I haven't been invited to this organization and admin
    needs to add me. Please help!

  content: Having trouble with Scale to Win. I logged in, but the page I get to just
    tells me to log in again. I do, input my two-factor authentication code, and I'm
    back to the page that says Welcome to Scale to Win and tells me to Log In.
