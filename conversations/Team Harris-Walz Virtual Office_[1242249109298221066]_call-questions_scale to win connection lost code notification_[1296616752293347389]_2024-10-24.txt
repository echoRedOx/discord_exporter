Content: Hello! One of our callers is getting a "connection lost code notification" from a couple of web browsers in Windows, using the Scale To Win dialer. Any suggestions?

Content: Sorry I didn't reply sooner David!  Sometimes with Scale to Win a brower switch resolves most issues.  We like to recommend Firefox if Chrome is buggy.

Content: No worries! We went from Chrome, to Firefox, to Edge, and somehow Edge worked.
