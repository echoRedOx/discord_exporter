  content: "<@&1260305280391184454> Hello team! I have some quick housekeeping things\
    \ for y'all: \n\nFirst, I want to say how grateful I am to be in this fight with\
    \ you all. I will work on sharing more positive interactions, but please know\
    \ that I scroll through the backend of HelpScout and Scale to Win every single\
    \ day, and whether it be making sure supporters are able to access virtual events,\
    \ or ensuring someone knows all their options for how to donate, y'all are making\
    \ a difference in this election. You should all feel very proud for taking on\
    \ some of the hardest texts and emails to respond to! This work requires a lot\
    \ of attention to detail and care, and y'all are doing great! \n\nSecond, if you\
    \ signed up to help out during Dempalooza next week, you should have received\
    \ an email to our meeting tonight. We will be using the Google Meet that is in\
    \ your email invite tonight at 7:30PM. **Please privately message me if you have\
    \ not received this. ** If you are helping out during Dempalooza but will not\
    \ be able to join us, please reach out to me also. If you have not signed up but\
    \ are interested in joining us, please sign up here: https://forms.gle/t7U8CehRWb2VgnDo6\n\
    \nNext, you will notice there are a few more channels under Digital Correspondence.\
    \ \n<#1270106354115285022> and <#1270411579065897021> are forum channels. **Please\
    \ do not edit anything here. ** You will be able to find FAQ, the volunteer report,\
    \ and platform guides under these channels. Double check these before you ask\
    \ a question the question channels. \n\nThis brings me to my last point! Moving\
    \ forward, we ask that you use the <#1272985533525659752> and <#1272985384279740607>\
    \ channels to ask questions about conversations. This will allow me to keep the\
    \ team channels clear so it's easier for y'all to find the latest campaigns and\
    \ email guidance. \n\nThank you all for your cooperation as we continue to build\
    \ this program -- Y'all are the best!"
