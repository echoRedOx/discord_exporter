  content: I don't see see any option to clearly disposition that the voter has already
    voted - some other thread suggested to choose  "Early Vote In Person"  - but will
    that prevent the voter from getting more calls from us?

  content: <@1199961707104190546> the campaign pulls voter records nightly and updates
    the lists accordingly, so if someone voted, they should fall of our lists within
    a couple of days of their vote being recorded as received

  content: In the zPB we ask who the voter supported - and add that answer ex. "Strong
    Harris" and than thank the caller and end call. Eventually they get dropped from
    the lists when they actually vote (incase they were just saying that)
