    from there to this discord server? Or do they need to take one of the trainings
    first?


    I also have the same question about inviting folks to the Reach site'

  content: We need them all! Send them over to Mobilize and have them sign up! And
    if they live in a battleground state or very close to one, tell them to go for
    that too if they can.

  content: Suzi, I got you. Mobilize is an online sign-up site that the DNC along
    with many state party offices and left-leaning & grassroots organizations use
    to get volunteers to sign up. Here is the link to the DNC's as an example (and
    send it to your friends) https://events.democrats.org/

  content: Thanks for the info! Just FYI, I personally found this site a bit overwhelming
    when I first went to it, as due to it's organization by date it was kind of hard
    to find out what sorts of opportunities were available--so it doesn't seem like
    a great general link for folks first getting started. I'm trying to find out what
    friends are interested in doing and then sending them specific links to events
    or trainings in those areas. Is there any way an overview menu could be put together
    for this site?

  content: You can use the Filters section to search for what you want from canvassing
    to phone banks, and virtual events. I used to do volunteer recruitment for PA
    Dems so I know that feature comes in very handy.
