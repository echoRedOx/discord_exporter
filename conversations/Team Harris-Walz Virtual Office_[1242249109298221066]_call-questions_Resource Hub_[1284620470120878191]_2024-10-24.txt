Content: One skilled phone banker in our group debrief mentioned a "Resource Hub."  Anyone know what that is?  I need a source for facts about major issues, not just campaign slogans.  I wasn't able to locate talking points fast enough on the long sidebar during the call.  I'll have to put together my own workbook, I think.
