    Kelly Tschibaka running for anything up there this time around? I know she's (R)

    Lisa Murkowski last time around and lost.

  content: That is a loaded question you just asked. She is part of the problem. I
    think she is in the Valley. She is doing a podcast or show of sort with her husband.
    I am sure you can find it online. Project 2025 started here in Alaska long ago,
    as you must already be aware of, I am somewhat surprised to see you one this side
    of the aisle. I am quite perplexed actually.

    myself from her in 2020 when she started agreeing with the "stolen election" theory
    in 2020. And then when she was running for Senate and appeared with Trump...that
    was pretty much THE END. Even though I don't live there...I'm glad Murkowski won...even
    though she's (R) she seems very much in the middle and we're losing too many of
    middle (R)'s. I mean I'd rather it be (D) but if it can't be (D) it needs to at
    least be middle (R).

  content: I would call myself an independent. When I am voting, I tend to lean (D)
    but if there is an issue I'm particular about, I will look at all candidates for
    a specific race and go with the candidate that is closest to me. In other words,
    I'm true to country before party. That said, I have yet to vote for an (R) in
    a presidential or congressional race, but I have considered (R)'s in some local
    races where I have lived because in those instances the (D)'s running had some
    unusual positions. Hope that makes sense.

  content: HI <@1268980664468771078> - Yes, I am in Texas, but I just started help
    Alaska (on FB and by extension here on Discord). I can definitely get you some
    resources.  One important note regarding down-ballot Dems or other grassroots
    orgs. Of course, we love them, but due to campaign finance rules, we have to avoid
    posting anything that involves fundraising or merch that is not for National Dems
    or Harris Walz directly. This includes state and local party stuff and state/local
    candidate stuff.
