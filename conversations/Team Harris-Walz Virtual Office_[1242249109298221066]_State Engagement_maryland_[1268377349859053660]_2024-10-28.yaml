  content: Hey y'all!  Awesome a Maryland thread.  I'm T from MD.  Been making calls
    for Alsobrooks.  I am concerned that there have been no virtual events on Mobilize
    (that i have seen) to do any virtual calls or virtual textbanks for April McClain
    Delaney.  I receive email messages from her campaign stating how close the race
    between her and Republican Neil Parrot is for the House Seat.  I feel more online
    virtual events need to be done to get her elected! Now, that I think about it
    there's been no textbanking for Angela Alsobrooks either (but lots of phonebanks
    of which I've been taking part) What does everyone else think?  HarrisWalzLandslide!!  Let's
    go Maryland!

  content: i took a look at his site. he doesn't list a stance on repro freedom or
    anything.  I assume he knows MD is majority BLUE and so he's not putting it. I
    did hear he is totally anti-choice& apparently extreme.  sigh.  Don't want him
    in the House! That seat needs to stay BLUE. And don't want Hogan in Senate.

  content: my dad pointed out there was an alsobrooks ad on tv last night. idk what
    station. so that's good.  I just got an invite from MD DEMS asking me to join
    the montgomery college rally. I msged the person back requesting they add virtual
    options for these rallies/speaking engagements for those who can't go out to events
    as well as adding textbanking for Delaney & phonebanking. they should do textbanking
    for Alsobrooks too! I hope he passes that request on. Mail in ballot voting will
    begin possibly 20th Sept- Oct 5th . maybe they are textbanking at in person locations
    or calling. idk. but there are none for supporters to do virtually for Delaney
    except one virtual phonebank I participated in & imo it was like Delaney was an
    afterthought as far as communicating it to voters. does anyone know when & how
    to watch Hogan alsobrooks debate & is there 1 for Delaney & Parrot.

  content: I looked at Bluevoter guide someone had shared a link to earlier today
    on here & the concept is very cool. but its missing the 2nd ballot  question on
    reducing  county exec terms.  at a recent meeting, some Dems seemed to say that
    was put on ballot by Republicans & to vote against the measure. if that is the
    case- they need to get the msg out to the public immediately. bc otherwise it's
    like oh term limits make sense look at supreme court etc. super impt that they
    inform Marylanders if they do want us to vote against that cuz 8 had no idea.

  content: There has been a lot of combined campaign canvassing events. There is usually
    at least one a week out of Crofton and multiple out of Annapolis. I haven't seen
    as many yard signs or anything like that which is unfortunate. I went canvassing
    back in early August and was surprised at how many people had never even heard
    of her. The Annapolis office just ramped up some phone banking events, they are
    almost daily for Harris and Alsobrooks.

    weekend in my hometown of Annapolis. I follow Alsobrooks on instagram and I'm
    surprised she shows up in town without any event. If she shows up in Annapolis,
    I'd love to meet her and talk to her about messaging

  content: I went door knocking for Alsobrooks in Baltimore City yesterday.  We encountered
    people who didn't know anything about the Senate campaign, but committed to voting
    for Alsobrooks after we spoke with them.  We left door hangers where people didn't
    answer.  These could help overcome Hogan's name recognition.   I'd encourage everyone
    to try to find some time to do this in your area.

  content: I really object to them doing that. to me, that takes away MoCo county's
    voices b/c they split up the county and attached part of it to Western counties-Garrett,
    Allegany, Washington (and Frederick) but Frederick isn't so western. but the other
    3-apparently pretty heavily republican as far as i've heard. So to split up MoCo
    and attached part of it to these Western MD counties isn't right, imo.

  content: "Delaney\u2019s district is always caught up in redistricting battles.\
    \ For years, an awful older man (Tea Party, anti-ACA, reproductive rights, etc.)\
    \ was our Congressman. The last I saw, Delaney is trailing behind! I don\u2019\
    t see a lot of Democratic resources for her, but I plan to start canvassing for\
    \ both her and Alsobrooks on Saturday. We no longer have a local newspaper and\
    \ there is little information about the Republican, Parrott. But I know from 2022\
    \ that he is quite extreme and will not be a friend to ordinary voters."

  content: yeah sadly that's my district & I'm none too pleased that it's suddenly
    a "competitive" district. Good job, <@1202478087753830430>  I've been getting
    emails from Delaneys campaign. Parrot is completely anti-abortion EVEN IN CASES
    OF RAPE OR INCEST.  He voted to WEAKEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS. I AM IN A VERY
    BLUE AREA. CANNOT BELIEVE AN EXTREME REPUBLICAN COULD REPRESENT US. AND IT'S A
    HOUSE SEAT TOO. I'm really not seeing any fundraising msgs or many digital virtual
    opportunities to call on her behalf & have seen no texting on her behalf. I can
    only do virtual, not in person.

  content: the new redistricting has screwed things up. I don't see how they could
    have done that. also he purposely has ZERO ABOUT ABORTION on his website. I wasn't
    familiar w him at all.

  content: I am referring to April Delaney when I say she.  There have been phonebanks
    for Angela. I participated in some .but we only called district 06 (Delaney's)
    once. at least the ones I did. Delaney & Alsobrooks & Kamala need to win!!  I
    feel like making up a cheer for it haha.

  content: "Thanks for your information. I am going to the Poolesville Day Parade\
    \ on Saturday and then I\u2019ll go to learn canvassing in Frederick or Damascus.\
    \ As I learn the talking points, I willing to canvass in the redder areas of the\
    \ district. We are attached to much of western Maryland, which is aggravating.\
    \ Her husband self-funded and got a fair amount of attention-but that was in a\
    \ differently drawn district and when we still had local newspapers (not to be\
    \ redundant, but it is such a problem to not have one during elections)."

  content: afaik Hogan alsobrooks & delaney parrot are the close ones & I feel not
    enough attention has been paid. glad it seems within last couple days there has
    been some more effort at I guess a national level to do increased voter outreach
    to our state for Alsobrooks. But haven't seen much outreach for ppl to vote Delaney.
    which concerns me. no other MD races are close correct?  I haven't seen reporting
    of any.

  content: I spoke with the Maryland BoE last week which confirmed they would start
    mailing ballots imminently, but that it would take a while to mail the ballots
    to everyone who has already requested one because of the sheer volume. Mine was
    delivered by mail yesterday. They have already installed the 286 ballot drop boxes
    -- so people are voting now.

  content: my dad says he's seeing a lot of anti Alsobrooks ads on tv. (I don't watch
    much TV these days but turn it on once in a while in the morning to see political
    ads haha. I am seeing a number against Hogan but also saw a couple against alsobrooks.
    I may try 2 keep an eye on which over the air shows what. like nbc has some against
    him. this morning my local ABC SINCLAIR affiliate had one against her. finally
    saw 1 against Hogan. have seen ZERO for Delaney at all & I don't think my dad
    has either.  but maybe they're targeting ads to more republican areas of the state?
    idk. I asked if he saw any for kamala. he said maybe a couple. ppl are voting
    here already mail in ballots. I wonder why barely any ads for harris? or...maybe
    targeting Republican areas...then again someone in neighborhood has parrot sign
    & previously had Trump sign so..

  content: I had always assumed he was a Libertarian based off his goofy green signs
    that are up every few years.  I just realized when I filled my ballot out the
    other day that he's actually a republican.

    \ me yesterday. They really need more canvassers leading up to Nov 5!**  If you\

    \ for you and come help get out the vote in this very Blue city!  \n\n**Hogan\

  content: I went ahead and voted the other day. but I am so appalled that there is
    no info on judges' views & they are in office for 10 to 15 years. I did my best
    to do due diligence and then I did my ballot. but there is a HUGE PROBLEM. there
    isn't info on county or circuit court judges'  views.  general info on them &
    their general answers to unimportant questions does nothing. it's NUTS. it's like
    a secret. I hope ppl who are on a position do something about this so voters can
    be informed.we as voters are not informed or provided with info in order to vote
    on judges! I found it utterly unacceptable.

  content: I already voted and it says received, so yay! waiting for it to be counted.  But
    i was super disappointed in that there's no info about the judges (both MoCo circuit
    court & statewide appellate court judges) and those ppl get 10 to 15 YEAR terms.
    i tried to ask a number of organizations and found out nothing. but like, we don't
    know if judges are pro choice or their views...finally voted after seeing i wouldn't
    be able to get anywhere with that. county dems are reccomending to vote for all
    the appellate and circuit county courts...if anyone knows more info on those judges'
    views or reasons ppl should not vote for them, i will try to spread the msg.  it's
    nuts we don't get info on ppl who serve for so many years!

    thanks to bluevoterguide i found out about Brenda Diaz! otherwise wouldn't have
    known. it's not smart imo that the Dems weren't warning ppl. plenty of us vote
    by mail.  just now they started to in very seemingly vague way warn that there's
    an extreme candidate in MoCo running for BOE.  hope they are warning in other
    counties!! how did u find that list and know who is extreme? good job btw!!

  content: your ballot was counted already?! nice!  mine was received. waiting to
    hear that it's counted.  also-why what do other states say that make it less clear?
    and personally I find the board of elections website kinda confusing.  and you
    kind of have to search around before you find the "track ballot," tab.  also ppl
    who might know- does ballot received just mean they took the envelope w signature
    off the ballot and they have put your ballot somewhere? but they have not scanned
    it/looked at what you voted yet? i was wondering that. b/c since it's sposed to
    be anonymous, hopefully they separate it from the envelope without looking at
    the vote....

    Lots of canvassing and phone banking shifts available:

  content: That's the exact problem i ran into. Dem sample ballot says to vote for
    the appellate and circuit court (montgomery county) judges. BUT i read the GOP
    sample ballot (saw it) reccs the exact same thing!  so.....that was  a major concern
    to me-wanted to know these judges' views on things! but any site that asked them
    questions were general stuff-didn't enhance my knowledge of their views on important
    things like pro repro freedom, democracy etc.  That is a MAJOR FLAW imo that we
    voters are not being informed about judicial candidates who serve 10 to 15 yr
    terms! did what i could to ask organizations-got no answers. bluevoterguide did
    say who appointed them. shrug. Dems really need to start educating us on these
    impt judicial appointments!

    made and things like that? i already voted, but if there's any reason ppl shouldn't
    vote for the state appellate justices or anyone else knows reasons ppl shouldn't
    vote for MoCo judges, i will do my best to inform others.

  content: ohhhhhh. interesting b/c i listened to npr just now, they said that for
    the 1st time since 1988 they weren't endorsing and wanted to "get back to their
    roots" that Bezos had gov't contracts and Amazon, but it made no mention of him
    having stopped Washington Post from endorsing her. thanks for sharing! hmm....i
    thought he hated Trump. but maybe he feels it's bad for his businesses??

    endorsement of Kamala by the editorial staff.  The Editor-at-large, Robert Kagan,
    resigned in protest and I posted that I will follow him anyway he lands in journalism
    or social media because of that moral courage.

  content: So, there's a reason we're asking you to call, and it's because the campaign
    is asking us to make that ask because it's important. Phone banking is the single
    most effective thing we can do to get Kamala elected outside of knocking on doors.
    It's critical. We wouldn't be asking you to do it if there weren't a real, serious
    need to get people to call. I understand that chatting in a discord server is
    a lot more comfortable - and probably a lot more fun - and we really appreciate
    the community folks have built here, but at the end of the day, this server exists
    to steer people towards volunteerism. In this moment, with ten days left, that
    means calling. There are many, many other servers for political discourse. This
    one is for volunteering and for connecting people with volunteer positions.

  content: Good afternoon, <@&1245910503457558672> ! I'm here because campaign staff
    are asking us to see if folks in state channels might be willing to make some
    calls today towards our 10 million calls goal. Frances and other HQ staff have
    explicitly requested that mods post here. (As has been the case every other time
    we've posted!) We know you have an incredible senate candidate (loved her DNC
    speech! so powerful!) but, as this is the national campaign server, we're politely
    asking that if folks have some extra time today or in the coming week, you join
    us in <#1242256751445934262> (if you don't have this, go to <id:customize> and
    select "talk to voters in key states") or head [straight to the dialer ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=9ccd3f9e-fa00-4de0-8919-eef3896d1a0d&ref=natl_dis_host_discordveveryoneelse)
    to make some calls. We are here at the finish line, and GOTV in swing states is
    going to be absolutely critical to our success. We'd love to see you over there
    supporting this effort. Thanks, all!

  content: yes bluevoterguide.org warned me about Diaz! i wouldn't have known otherwise!  Finally
    MD Dems seem to be tweeting about the school board candidates. Judges are hard-bluevoterguide
    does say who appointed them-my issue is-both Dem and GOP are recommending voting
    for all judges on BOTH their sample ballots.  I'm like, why? I did my best, hope
    Dems have advised well, but as i lamented in prior posts, we don't know about
    these judges' opinions on Pro-choice, medical aid in dying, democracy, so many
    issues etc.  Their interview answers tell you nothing as far as I'm concerned.  Dems/Independents
    really need to start informing US so we are knowledgeable about ppl whose positions
    last 10-15 year terms! It's nuts, imo not to inform voters.  Now that I am paying
    attention closely locally in this election, I became aware of this!

  content: yeah but look at who's on Supreme Court. They have a semblance of what
    they're doing too, but look how dangerous the majority is! So, i feel they are
    asking us to vote with no info on these ppl. And now it is clear how impt Judges
    can be regarding everything. So idk why there's no effort made to educate the
    voters!  I am so glad either someone on this site or Field Team 6 posted bluevoterguide
    so i learned about that resource back when i was researching and trying to find
    out stuff. at least it informed me about school board.  But how they do things
    needs to change imo! Very flawed.

    bother to inform anyone till early voting  began, which imo bad flaw as well,
    leaving ppl to struggle to research everything the best they can

    and I'm really quite sick of it.  I disagreed with McCain and Romney on a great
    many things, but I never viewed them as existential threats.  Even when he started
    running back in 2015 I viewed Trump as an existential threat.  It's going on a
    decade of this crap, and I'm tired, boss.

  content: They at least cared about preserving cultural norms and maintaining the
    decorum of the presidency.  The president had, until 2016, essentially been expected
    to conduct himself as one of, if not THE, most dignified Americans.  Once Trump
    waddled into the Oval office and began debasing himself on a daily basis, it essentially
    gave everyone else in permission to behave as their worst selves too.  He is,
    after all the most dignified among us by virtue of being the president.

  content: but do you know what i mean? a lot of ppl probably believe Trump b/c he
    WAS the president (illegitimately w/Russia's help imo). So they didn't think the
    president would LIE TO THEM.  and now i listen to bits of what trump and vance
    say in speeches on cspan occassionaly, and they are saying Kamala's a dictator,
    a fascist etc, everything that TRUMP is. and for ppl who don't know, they probably
    hear both sides calling each other the same thing and don't know what to beliveve.
    I was texting today-for 4 hours for reproductive freedom for all. i literraly
    got a reply from a Marylander who said everyone lies, it's hard to know what to
    believe, so they weren't voting. That's exactly what Trump, Vance majority of
    GOP & the current owner of Twitter, have done. I myself see things and don't always
    know what's true.  So anyway Idk if it will have an impact, but i messaged the
    person back and told them i understand it can be difficult to tell, but that their
    vote is important, and told them Kamala stands for democracy, women's rights &
    constitution, but trump wants a dicatorship and to implement project 2025 and
    take away our freedoms and right to control our body and likely our ability to
    vote. and asked them to vote. so...that's all you can do.

  content: Here's the thing though - they're not wrong. In every campaign there are
    inaccuracies on both sides.  It's impossible to get everything 100% correct over
    a campaign cycle.  Even when you campaign with honest and noble intentions, mistakes
    happen. Facts and figures can be interpreted one way or another, and even accurate
    statements can be interpreted as lies under the right circumstances. Now add a
    24x7 news cycle, pundits, podcasts, twitter, Facebook and everyone on the planet
    sharing their (usually dumbass) opinions all the time, yeah, it's really easy
    to get it in your head that everyone lies and there's no point in participating
    in government.  That, in a democracy, is simply not an option. Playing the "bOtH
    sIdEs tHe SaMe" card is lazy and counterproductive.  If you don't like either
    side, then it's your duty as a citizen to pick the side you like best, get involved,
    and work until you do like it. A democratic system of government was never designed
    for the citizenry to be hands off, but that's how we've come to treat it in the
    US.  So many people pay no attention and do nothing for 3.5 years, then moan and
    complain every general election cycle because they don't like the candidates or

    with a handful of other kids and the state senator from Washington county (Don

    didn't understand how significant it was at the time.

    a call? b/c it doesn't make sense, does it? did all of u have supreme court judges

  content: i had the circuit court judges and the 3 appellate court judges on my ballot.
    but not any supreme court justices...i read the map you posted and what you wrote,
    I guess i don't really understand what it means... also the appellate court are
    for the whole state i thought. while circuit court was MoCo circuit court (on
    mine). but still don't get the supreme court thing-or you mean the state supreme
    court has justices from diff counties ? and maybe MoCo's justices on supreme court
    weren't the ones up for reelection?? but state appellate court justices are...shrug,
    shakes head. confused. lol

    may be up for re-election, one of them is not the one from the 7th appellate,
    so that's not on our ballot.  But I'm not really sure.  I'm no expert
