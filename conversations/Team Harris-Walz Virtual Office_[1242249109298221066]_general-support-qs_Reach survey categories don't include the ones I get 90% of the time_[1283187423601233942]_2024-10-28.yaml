  content: 'Not sure if this is the right place to put this: I''ve been using Reach
    to survey friends and family. The two issues that come up 90% of the time are
    stopping Trump and reproductive rights, but neither is in the list of issues.
    Is there a reason for that? Will it change any time soon? (hope this doesn''t
    sound unpleasant, I think you are all doing an amazing job!!) Thanks.'

  content: I wasn't clear. In Reach there are tags for issues the person cares about,
    but no tags for reproductive rights or preserving democracy which are the two
    I get most often. Thanks!
