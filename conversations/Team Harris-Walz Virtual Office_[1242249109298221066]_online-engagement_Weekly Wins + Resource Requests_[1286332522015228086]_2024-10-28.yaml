  content: 'I shared a map that I received from League of Women Voters. It showed
    range percentages of women voters in all the states from the last election. High
    levels: MI, WI PA, GA.  Lowest levels of women voters were in southern states.
    Lots of boosts and interest.'

  content: "Hi Gabrielle, I am a Harris-Walz supporter located in Detroit, Michigan.\
    \ And I belong to the MI Women for Harris-Walz FB group. Over the last month+\
    \ there has been a lot of posts by women in \u201Cred areas\u201D of the state\
    \ with fear about posting H-W signs in their yards. So a lot of creative alternatives\
    \ have been discussed to show support. And women like me in \u201Cblue areas\u201D\
    \ show support, lean an ear and encourage confidence and resolve to support H-W.\
    \ One of the very creative and brilliant idea that has come out of this group\
    \ are post-its to encourage women in red areas to vote their heart. Now one innovation\
    \ woman has had them printed. Ladies have been placing them on stall doors in\
    \ women\u2019s room."
