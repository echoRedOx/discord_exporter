  content: At this time, we do not have the capacity to target calls that specifically.  At
    https://events.democrats.org/ you may apply a variety of filters to available
    opportunities and determine which is right for you.  I will ask for more ideas
    in our moderator channel and leave this discussion open for more input. Thank
    you for your talents and for making a difference in this election!
