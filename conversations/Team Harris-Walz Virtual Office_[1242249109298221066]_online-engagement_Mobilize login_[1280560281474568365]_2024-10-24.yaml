  content: Then you have multiple accounts on Mobilize.  I suggest sticking to the
    email address that you've already registered for scheduled upcoming events.

  content: When I go into Discord to change my e-mail to my gmail acct, it requires
    that I get an e-mail at my comcast inbox to  get a verification code in order
    to chnage my discord e-mail... BUT I never get the verification code e-mail in
    my comcast inbox (and its not in junk spam either). I am stuck with Discord on
    comcast e-mail and mobilize on gmail.. which means I will never get the e-mails
    with training slides

  content: Discord is separate from Mobilize.  (If you've enabled "followup messages"
    in Mobilize, then Mobilize would have sent the followup to the same email address
    that you registered for that event.)

  content: You can ask in <#1250550849998946417>, but I haven't heard of the slides
    being sent in a followup email.
