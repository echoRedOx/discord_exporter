Yes, feel free to hop in anytime to make calls. If you can, try to join at the beginning of the session to go through training. That said, our VOTE team members are there to help with questions!"

On the dialer there is a preview of that session's script. That said, don't worry if you need to ease yourself in. You can help at your pace!"
