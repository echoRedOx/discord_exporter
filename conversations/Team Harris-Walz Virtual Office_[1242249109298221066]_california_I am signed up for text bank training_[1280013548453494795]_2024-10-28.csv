I missed the last portion, which I understand included the quiz that will allow me to text with you all. I am a very experienced texter, having been at this since Team Joe and Victory 2020, along with Beto's senate/gubernatorial campaigns and Powered by People. Presently a text mod with Campaign for Democracy as well. Is there any way you can send me that quiz link, or do I need to sit for the whole training again?"

You might also DM her and ask if she can send you her calendly link for a 15 minute 1-on-1 to override the quiz portion. Sorry it's been such a hassle."
