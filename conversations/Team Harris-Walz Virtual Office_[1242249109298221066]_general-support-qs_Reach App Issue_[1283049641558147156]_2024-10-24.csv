For example, it will take me to BlueSky but the image won't populate. In cases like that I simply upload the image from my phone to the social network (do a workaround). That may be the case with Threads. Thanks for your help sharing this important content with your connections. We appreciate it!"

Seems like everything gets glitchy these days from Discord to Reach to my phone. ðŸ˜‚ Glad it's working now!

Try to swipe away your Reach app, or power cycle your device. ANd copy paste the code instead of typing it."
