I'm finding Reach very difficult. I put in a friend complete with address and I get back 33 matches, none of which are in the state I entered. Is there a way for me to manually enter new contacts and their survey results, etc.?"

I put just your name and MA, only one person popped up, I'm pretty sure it's you. Try your friend's name and their zip code. See that helps"

Tap My Reach (bottom-center) and swipe through it's little tutorial and after that you can connect"
