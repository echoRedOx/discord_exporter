Content: Actually, we won’t see lower prices because inflation is dead. We will see lower prices because the market can no longer support the increased prices, consumers are pulling back on discretionary spending, and lower prices are necessary to entice customers back. As we have seen from the cost of insulin and epi pens, the cost of goods has nothing to do with overhead and everything to do with what corporations can get away with. And if they can make $13 billion dollars off the upper class while letting hundreds of thousands of people die, it’s no never mind to them.

Content: My point is that expecting prices to go DOWN because costs go down is inaccurate and naive. If prices were that simple, insulin would be significantly cheaper. It is not. As another example, your landlord might raise rents because the property tax went up, but if the legislature lowers property taxes and you are making your rent payment, the landlord *isn’t* going to lower your rent. They are going to keep the full new payment amount the same and pocket the remainder as profit. 

The only time prices go down is when the number of people who can’t afford to pay (or some other factor, like regulation or collective action) actually hits the bottom line hard enough that the vendor has no choice.
