  content: II also took training on the 27th. I can access the texting-campaingns
    channels now, but there is nothing there , but a welcome message.  Are we only
    texting during the training sessions and do we have to sign up each time?

  content: I am really confused as it seems many are.  What private channel? And how
    do we access that? On saturday, we set up our spoke accounts and the discord account
    and were then able to text. My understanding is that we were to watch this space
    for future texting opportunities. Where should I be looking?

    equally unhelpful. I signed up to make calls, and the trainer was only looking
    for team leaders, not people to make calls. Love the enthusiasm but it's a bit
    disorganized.

  content: Hi Brook! Currently the text training events are the only time text campaigns
    are running so you're not missing anything yet. Staff is still working toward
    getting regular text campaigns up and running. I did notice the permissions on
    some channels for the text team category have changed as we tidy up the server.

    your patience and we work on moving things over from Slack to Discord! You should
    have access to the private text team chanels now (texting-announcements, texting-questions,
    texting-campaigns, and texting-nice-things). We have not posted any text campaigns
    in Discord yet, but hoping to get it up and running by next week! Keep an eye
    on the texting-announcements channel for updates, and the links will be posted
    in texting-campaigns. Let me know if that helps!
