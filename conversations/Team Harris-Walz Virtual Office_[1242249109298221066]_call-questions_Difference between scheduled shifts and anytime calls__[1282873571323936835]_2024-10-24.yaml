  content: "Hi all, \n\n I just finished my first phone bank shift and really enjoyed\
    \ it! I\u2019d like to do it more and saw some mentions about an anytime calling\
    \ group. \n\n1) Do I need to complete a separate training to participate in the\
    \ anytime calling group? \n\n2) If not, is there a link I could use to log onto\
    \ the dialer whenever I have a few spare minutes?\n\nThanks for all y\u2019all\
    \ do! Feels awesome to actually get involved and I\u2019m excited to do more \u25E1\
    \u0308"
