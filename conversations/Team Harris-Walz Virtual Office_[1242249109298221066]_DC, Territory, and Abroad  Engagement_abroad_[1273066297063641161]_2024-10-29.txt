Content: I was tabling earlier with Democrats Abroad--around 15 volunteers. Apparently last time (pre-Harris announcement) there were just two. Several first-timers, including me. One passerby said it's her first time voting and she's very excited to support Harris/Walz.

Content: Thank you. Are these phonebanks to people in the US or other people in your area abroad? I find that the transmission latency with calls across an ocean gets pretty unworkable for me. Meanwhile, the textbanking is all full still

Content: I just did a phone bank training with Democrats Abroad. The related software gives callers options to make calls so that you call people at appropriate times (ie not middle of the night). You can call anywhere in those allowed times. So you can call people in Asia, or EU, or Americas, depending on what time it is. It's set up to be pretty failsafe on this point. It's possible to join calls with another volunteer to get the hang of how the software works and what the script reads like.

Content: Waving hi from Berlin. Did a phone bank this afternoon from 3-5. It's pretty slick. Was able to reach people from 9-11 AM Eastern, mostly talked to people from Massachusetts. It was nice to preach to the choir. I was in Brooklyn before I moved here because Trump said "Go back where you came from." Before that I was in SF, and first voted for VP Harris as DA. Everyone knew she was going places so it was no surprise when she ran for AG. It'll be great for everyone to enjoy SF values.

Content: I'm also a Brooklyn-to-DE transplant, though am now in M√ºnchen (was in Berlin before). Going to the Dems Abroad get-together here later. My ancestors were from here so I guess I've "gone back where I came from" too.

Content: It will happen in the middle of the night here in Berlin. I usually watch highlights over breakfast/coffee. Is it worth trying to get people together to do it all together? Hopefully c-span will have the video up.

Content: I‚Äôm pretty active with Democrats Abroad and we definitely need tons more support to call our fellow Overseas Voters. And many branches are hosting voter assistance events. The online training is pretty easy for those and there‚Äôs a great support team to help with any questions. If you‚Äôre willing to get  involved, you can sign up from within the Democrats Abroad website once you are active in their database. Ping me if you have questions or if I can be of any help. Also, if you haven‚Äôt already, please check out & explore their VoteFromAbroad.org website - they built it specifically to make it easier for us to vote from anywhere‚Ä¶we need to get that site shared widely to Democrats globally. Please help share it.

Content: Why are the URLs/links to the website for Democrats Abroad and the voter resource they created (Vote From Abroad .org) specifically to increase successful voting among Dems living overseas, both *banned* from being shared or posted in Team Harris_Walz Discord channels (except for getting hidden in the ‚Äòunofficial links‚Äô channel as if these aren‚Äôt Democrats‚Äô own pages)? 
That‚Äôs literally censoring your own team and preventing sharing the very messaging that your own party leaders are investing in and working hard to promote elsewhere ‚Ä¶. But it‚Äôs prohibited here? 
That‚Äôs just absurd and self-defeating.

Content: Hello Linda, I appreciate your frustration, there is a lot of great resources that can move voters forward to elect Kamala Harris. However, **US Federal campaign law** specifies that this server can only share links to Harris for President, Harris Victory Fund, and Democratic National Committee.

Content: Thanks for explaining that. I‚Äôm not clear enough on the organizational structures to know if or why Democrats Abroad isn‚Äôt a subsidiary of the DNC. It‚Äôs pretty frustrating that there‚Äôs such a limitation on an organization that essentially serves as a chapter of the DNC. But that‚Äôs good info to know - thanks for sharing it.

Content: Hi Linda. It's because there are various branches and campaigns within the DNC, including state and local as well as abroad. The fundraising for these campaigns and branches can't "co-mingle" and there are rules about how donations can be allocated within these as well. We can post their non-fundrasing/donate link events anywhere on the server. (edited for clarity).

Content: Great! Thank you both for checking into the details. The fundraising part makes sense. I‚Äôm more interested in spreading the word about the online platform that they created to make it much easier for Americans abroad to submit their request (FPCA form) to receive their ballot under the UOCAVA laws - which require every state to provide the option of overseas voters receiving their ballot electronically and no later than Sept 21.
Their Vote From Abroad .org  website makes it easy to do.
Democrats Aboard promotes it heavily, but put it under a separate nonpartisan organization designation for both legal and practical reasons - for example, I host Voter registration & Overseas Ballot Request events at a local farmers market in Costa Rica, which I can do under the VFA banner. They wouldn‚Äôt allow foreign political action/campaigning, but they will allow nonpartisan voter registration activities. So we publicize heavily to our DA members and on liberal social media, to ensure a strong turnout of Democrats coming for voter assistance but only put ip VFA signage.
Unfortunately, Democrats Abroad has found that another organization is also targeting overseas voters. I‚Äôve seen their paid ads across social media so they have some stronger funding than we have. And, the danger is that their online form submission process doesn‚Äôt actually work consistently. So voters who use their website *think* they are getting registered to vote, but in reality Democrats Abroad has been contacted by LEOs across the country because the forms coming from the competitor‚Äôs website are frequently rejected by the election clerks. That is making it more essential than ever for Democrats to get word out with the accurate information and the link to their own voter registration platform: Vote From Abroad .org so that overseas voters are actually getting registered. How can we promote that here?

Content: <@1266880404745617582> I think you just did a great job promoting that here. You can also link to https://www.votefromabroad.org/ since that page doesn't have a donate button. Posting in this channel should get the attention of all folks who choose "abroad" as one of their roles.

Content: Thanks @Jen Medeiros [CA] * Mod. Most of those events seem to be via Mobilize, which requires a US (or Canadian?) phone number to sign up. I've heard that we can make a US-based Google Voice number, but haven't tried that out. Is anyone in here doing that to join US-based phone banking?

Content: <@779382569534881824> Sorry for delayed reply.  The best official government site is https://www.fvap.gov/florida. This gives you a backup ballot option, which is  https://www.fvap.gov/fwab-privacy-notice.

Content: Thanks Jay. It sounds like it should be on the way since it says they‚Äôre mailed 45 days before and we‚Äôre already past that now. Thanks for your help. I‚Äôll look into the other options as well. I‚Äôm concerned because I got a letter in the mail after the primary saying that my vote was NOT counted because it didn‚Äôt arrive in time before the deadline. A week and a half from Canada should have been enough time, but clearly it wasn‚Äôt!

Content: Got my ballot and voted this morning. And convinced my spouse who was going to sit it out to apply to get a ballot. Probably doesn't mean much in Dan Goldman's district in NY, but it's good to send a message with sheer volume. If you know people on the fence (my spouse is Jewish and very upset about Gaza, and we have Lebanese friends here in Berlin who are frantically evacuating family from a new war zone (de-escalation through escalation.), I was able to convince to particpate by saying: "A lot of people died for us not to have ostensible monarchs. A lot of people want to take away my right to vote. (The save act in the congress makes it harder for married women who changed their name to register to vote if they didn‚Äôt change their name everywhere) One party doesn‚Äôt. If you continue going about muttering under your breath about there being no difference between the two parties for Gazans and Lebanese, which is tiresome (the muttering not the content), I'm going to start muttering about the long arc of the moral universe bending towards justice. (If anyone has any good things that are helpful if you know people from Gaza and Lebanon, who would rather US not fund indiscriminate killing of doctors, children, and journalists, that would be nice. For instance, a former colleague of mine spent this week getting his family to Beirut, which will probably be affected soon. He's a data scientist working on longevity, not a terrorist. I wish my tax dollars weren't causing the suffering of his family, and want something useful to say to him. But I hope Harris will be better than the other guy on the topic. AND VOTED FOR HER!!!!!) (Can't help but think this Lebanon action is an October surprise which is so tragically inhumane.)

Content: Hi Jay - I reached out to the organization at the link you sent and they replied with another link where I was able to check and see that my ballot has been mailed. I couldn‚Äôt find it on their website, I got the link from the reply they sent me. I thought I would include it here for other folks and in case you wanted to amplify it on other channels. It works for any state.

Content: Pinned message: The best resource for US Citizens Abroad is www.fvap.gov.  As an official campaign space, we have to be careful about websites shared, especially with voting info. (9/28: Slight edit: Outside of dot gov sites. many great organizations exist to support voting, but officially we always recommend I Will Vote dot com for DNC approved voting info. If we see a voting org like Vote 411, Vote Riders, US Vote Foundation, then we will likely leave it up, but we are required to comment about I Will Vote dot com.)  You can message an individual a link as long as they consent to receiving a message.

Content: Online outreach is an option‚Äîfrom countering disinformation they spot in the wild to sharing info about Harris/Walz policies (or the links to speeches, or campaign social media posts) on social media. NATO, the climate, policies toward China, and maintaining the rule of law worldwide are all issues of global interest that they can start with to interest their audiences in the campaign. Non-citizens can also encourage their American colleagues, friends, and family to vote or get involved with volunteering activities, and share relevant links and info.

Content: Yay <@1267855122478796894>, thanks so much for all your interest. I second climate engagement. Regarding all volunteer opportunities, only one age and geographic restriction exists to my knowledge.  For the Inbound DNC Voter Protection Hotline, not to be confused with outbound phone banks, you must be at least 18 and living in the US. This is a special project.  However, we have so many other programs with no restriction, so you will have a rich bounty of options.  See reference for DNC Voter Protection Hotline.

Content: Hello can I get some help from the campaign regarding absentee ballots? My brother who is a registered republican hadn‚Äôt been registered to vote, but I helped him send out a registration form in early September. He is planning on voting for Kamala Harris and has become extremely frustrated because not only, has he not received a ballot form, but received a letter on Friday stating that his registration was not valid because his signature wasn‚Äôt valid!  He is completely frustrated and ready to not vote at all because of all the difficulty he‚Äôs been having. He called several times and was told they would send him something. I sent him the emergency ballot request form as well. 

Does anyone know what he can do, given the deadline is tomorrow?!

Content: That's the best place. Your other options are to get in contact with the U.S. Consulate or Embassy wherever he is in the world. He can't vote at a Consultate or Embassy but he can post it to them and they might be able to assist. Other options are Democrats Abroad. FVAP maintains a list of links to pretty much every resource a U.S. citizen overseas should need https://www.fvap.gov/links Please come back to let us know how you go

Content: Whats the best place or places to find links to watch events the next day? I get some in news apps and some in tiktok but generally that feels haphazard. 

Since most events occur while i am sleeping it would be great to find a place to follow them. KH website? A you tube channel?  Thanks and have an awesome day!

Content: Every Overseas Voter should have received (and hopefully already returned!) your ballot by now. If you didn‚Äôt this is the Backup Ballot - like a provisional ballot which you should fill out & submit ASAP. Then if your regular ballot arrives later you can still vote on it & return it and *this backup* will get discarded if/when your main ballot arrives. The backup will Only count if your main ballot gets disqualified (ie arrives after the deadline or they reject your signature or you forgot a mandatory secrecy envelope etc etc etc). There is no risk - it‚Äôs like a Provisional ballot in that it will never get ‚Äòdouble counted‚Äô because it gets replaced by your main ballot whenever that main ballot arrives and gets accepted.
So‚Ä¶if you haven‚Äôt voted yet, get your BACK UP BALLOT in today! Fill it out and follow the instructions for your state at

Content: Hi everyone! üëã

I‚Äôm Hannah, a journalist from Berlin working with ZEIT Online, one of Germany's largest publications. I'll be in New York this November covering the U.S. election. I mainly create video content for TikTok, and I'm really interested in meeting young people who are supporting Harris/Walz.

If you're actively working to get people to vote‚Äîwhether through TikTok, social media, or more traditional methods like door-to-door campaigning‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to connect and cover your efforts! I'm especially keen to follow what‚Äôs happening on the ground and capture the energy of the movement for my stories.

Feel free to DM me if you're interested or know someone who might be. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Content: I have this problem too from the UK. I would like to join text banking and I can't sign up. The problem started (that I noticed) on october 13th, and I tried safari and chrome, both of which blocked me. Then on the 14th I could access the site again. Now today (15th) I cannot access, and have tried safari and firefox, with and without icloud private relay. I do not have a VPN right now but maybe that would solve te issue.

Content: Yes, it's calling Democrats Abroad members and making sure they have a plan to vote. Also very important, and in a way much easier than DNC phonebanking bc people generally do not hang up on you.

Content: Hi folks thought I would boost this request. If you are up between 1:45 and 3pm Central European time, clicking these links help set up the phone banking for the day, and cloud flare isn‚Äôt blocking this site. You can just hold down the enter key on a computer to zoom through the list (people are even using clothespins.) (on a Mac you can‚Äôt use safari)

Content: I have tried that many times. They have no information except to say it doesn't look possible. This is very distressing. I hope that someone will inform the campaign that people abroad are not able to volunteer in this way. It certainly is possible as I did it for the last presidential campaign and for many other campaigns. The lack of assistance here is very troubling.

Content: Normally, we suggest using https://iwillvote.com/ for voter info.  However, it's best to check directly with the local state/county in which someone abroad is registered to vote, as the deadlines are very close, and they will have the most up-to-date ability to answer specific questions.

Content: I‚Äôm not really equipped to give more tech support than that. You should be able to google ‚Äòhow to use a vpn [with my computer details]‚Äô if you need more. The explanation of how it works more in depth would be long.

Content: Personally if I had the wherewithal to buy a flight to the e US to canvass, I‚Äôd be maxing out donations to all the close senate and house races, and then canvass from afar with tools. That would maximize the effect IMO. Having said that I enjoyed canvassing for person for John Kerry in Reno NV which I could do from SF. It was frustrating though because I felt that the problem was at the voter registration level not the turnout. This year there has been more of an emphasis on registration so that makes me happy.

Content: My understanding is that Philly is pretty well covered for canvassing (lots of NYC folks are able to help there), but if you want to fly to PA, there‚Äôs an urgent need for poll observers (trainings end early next week), and that there‚Äôs more need for general callers,  voter assistance hotline staffers (national or some state ones including PA), and ballot curing calls & research if you are detail-oriented, organized, have very reliable wifi and learn new roles & computer platforms quickly. Happy to share more info if any of that sounds appealing.

Content: ok, as <@1278730804926615744>  mentioned a while ago, ProtonVPN seems to work. It has a totally FREE version, no credit card number or personal info needed. One of the 3 countries allowed on the free  version is US so thats good. I just configured it into my computers network manager but it might be easier using their ProtonVPN app

If not then you might want to take <@1273910058132181030> advice until the change has propagated to your ISP

Content: Anyone have insights on faxing ballots & FWABs back (for the 5 states that allow that)? I‚Äôm hearing that the official FVAP fax service is very backlogged. Any insights if it‚Äôs still the best option or if it‚Äôs now better to us other efax services instead?

Content: I have heard that the FVAP fax program often gets backlogged close to the election, supposedly they only have 3 people doing or something. Here are some alternatives:  HelloFax allows you to send up to 5 pages for free.  https://www.hellofax.com/
FAX.PLUS allows you to send up 10 pages for free.  https://www.fax.plus/
I've also heard people recommend the app ScanGenius.

Content: Besides an earlier confirmation from the FVAP Fax site, we simply used the HP Mobile Fax function on the HP Smart app.  Got confirmation of the transmission and then the voting from our California election board.
