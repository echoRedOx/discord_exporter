Content: <@941196169852366859>  None of the Republican politicians who are endorsing Biden in 2024 have stepped up to resurrect Republicans For Biden-Harris.  So to me, none are willing to be outcasts from the GOP.

Content: They need to. Of course with some of them like Christie, the Dems in their state keep reminding them that they kissed Trump's backside for years so there's also that whole thing. Also, as someone orginally from NJ who still lives near the state (I'm outside of Philadelphia, PA now), I can tell you that no one listens to Chris Christie half the time anyway there...not since Bridgegate.

Content: <@941196169852366859> [Relational training](https://events.democrats.org/event/646616/) apparently targeted to PA's Republicans for Biden.  By the way, Haley got her RNCC speaking spot to continue her career.
