  content: You should try to follow the script closely,  You are welcome to make changes
    that make speaking to voters more comfortable for you.  Many volunteers change
    how they introduce themselves so that it works better for them.

  content: Thank you! I'm going to write that to refer to while I'm on a call. One
    of the things that kept me from volunteering in the past was fear that I'm not
    knowledgeable enough on the issues, vote history, etc. to answer questions or
    counter objections. I am sighed up to do this anyway because it's important, so
    I am setting fear aside. (First shift today.) This helps having a canned sentence
    ready so I won't panic, lol!)

  content: The first and only time i did phone banking ( 2 weeks ago) the script told
    me to lead off the call by asking if its is who we think it is, ie ask the person
    "Hello, is this John?" or whatever their name is. I've been taught never to confirm
    my name on a cold call and most people hung up on me the minute I asked. It seems
    to waste a lot of time and effort to lead off with this question.   I think you
    should change the script to eliminate that question and go straight to "Hi this
    is..., I'm a volunteer calling about..." Also, the options to click on once you
    actually talk to a person aren't that clear cut. For example if they confirm its"john
    and then hang up, do I click "this isthe right person" or do I click "hung up."
    I'll be doing phone banking again tomorrow and I'm kind of dreading this, FD

  content: I'm sorry you didn't have a good experience with your first phone bank.  The
    script does not have to be followed verbatim but we do want to get the bolded
    questions answered. You can change it around so it works for you.  We do want
    to confirm who we are talking to and mark the appropriate box.  If they hang up,
    then click the hang up button.  The scripts and reason for the calls change, so
    the script you saw may not be the same script next time. Thanks so much for joining
    our phone bank and hope you'll keep giving it a try!
