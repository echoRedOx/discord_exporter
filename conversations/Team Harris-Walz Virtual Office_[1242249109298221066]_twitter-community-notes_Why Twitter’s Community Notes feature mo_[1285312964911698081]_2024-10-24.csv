The consensus of the articles you sent is basically that CNs can work for scientific topics and stuff everyone agrees is misinformation, but it fails at fighting political disinformation.  Unfortunately that's what we're trying to fight here.  I'm wondering if it would be a better use of resources to direct volunteers into making phone calls or something else instead.  We've gotta win this election, and it seems that we could put a lot of effort into CNs and get nothing back.

That first article had a really interesting quote too: ""Twitter waits until a similar number of people on the political right and left have agreed to attach a public Community Note to a tweet.""  So ironically having even more people on the left voting for a CN might hurt its chances...  ðŸ˜¦"

Maybe you're right that focusing on getting people to jump into the conversation could work.  Retweeting, commenting, liking, etc.  I'm doing what I can on Reddit.  ðŸ™‚"

Unfortunately it didn't really work out that way in practice.
