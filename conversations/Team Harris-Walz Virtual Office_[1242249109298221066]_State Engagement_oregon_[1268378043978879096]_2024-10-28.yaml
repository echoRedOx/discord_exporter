    seen around me, but yesterday I drove over to coos bay to do some hiking & I saw
    3 Kamala for President signs (and about 6 trump signs) in my 2&1/2 hour drive.
    I was so excited, I cheered everytime I saw one! they were "unofficial" signs,
    haven't seen them before.

  content: I never forget the shock when I volunteered for the Kerry campaign and
    found out oregon is almost purple! I've noticed on a lot of the political maps
    on TV that were only listed as "leans blue". When I checked registration, we had
    over 990,000 dems,  700,000 reps, and 1,000,000 independents! We need those independents
    to vote blue up and down the ballot, at least this one time.

  content: Is Oregon complacent because usually by the time our results are in, the
    national election is already decided, plus, traditionally we're pretty strongly
    blue overall? We can't be complacent because we're becoming pretty purple in our
    local elections, winning the Governor's race by a narrow margin. Oregon is interesting
    because it's very blue in the Portland-Metro area, Salem, and Eugene areas, but
    pretty red elsewhere where the populations are smaller.

  content: I think that might be some of it. Especially for the presidential primary.
    Our primary is _so late_ and nearly every election cycle by the time our primary
    rolls around the major party candidate lists have been severely winnowed at best,
    or already decided on at worst. I would be so interested if going to a single
    primary date, or at least primaries that are a lot closer together, would benefit
    campaigns for some of the more progressive candidates.

    for so long and I wonder if it's time for newer blood there. But also it's hard
    to give up the connections and leadership he has by virtue of seniority. And we
    could certainly get a lot worse there.

  content: Hey, all, I am so happy to be able to volunteer from home. I am registered
    to make calls several times this week. I have talked to several persons who are
    planning to vote for Harris-Walz, many T-ers, and lots and lots of hangups. It's
    the T-ers I hope will stay on the line so I can genuinely connect, but it is nearly
    impossible, very acrimonious and hostile. The Harris-Walz calls are very uplifting
    and cancel out the nasty. Go Democrats!!!

  content: Organized a volunteering event at work today and together we wrote about
    250 letters for Vote Forward in about 2 hours.  That's a good number of letters,
    but I'm also hoping it will wind up being a baby step towards more active involvement
    for some of our employees who are newly outraged but not sure what to do with
    that energy.  <:Ivoted:1252808222868504576>   Anyway, it would be a very easy
    and worthwhile group activity for, say, a lunch hour or happy hour after work.

  content: Hi Holly, I'm knocking doors almost daily now.  It's a lot easier when
    you go with someone else! Let me know if you'd like to go and we can schedule
    something together. Right now I'm focused on apartment complexes reminding people
    to get registered if they've moved & talking about Janelle Bynum in OR05. It sounds
    like you've got a great volunteer team at work so keep up the great work! Door
    knocking isn't for everyone but it's great that people have other ways to contribute
    that don't involved doors or phones.

    the web page has a donate button which goes to a diffrent campaign than HVF, and
    that's a problem for campaign finance law.

    in the Park with a table & I was there floating around talking about registration
    & Project 2025 too. It was well attended & I was really glad to see Mult Dems
    there. Clackamas Dems couldn't have a booth at the Clackamas pride event but Clackamas
    County Clerk was there to encourage voter registration & I walked around that
    event talking about Project 2025 too. The Salem event was on 9/21/24.

    understand how to return them. This is such important work, and we have to close
    strong. But we can't make our 10 million call goal without your help. If you're
    experienced, you can go straight to our dialer [here ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=933f666e-c699-46e3-ac92-12d9cf6f3992)
    - if you're new, please join us over in <#1242256751445934262> to get connected
    to some training! (If you don't have that, go to  <id:customize>  and choose "talk
    to voters in key states.") Even making a few calls helps. Many hands make light
    work. Will you please come over and join us?
