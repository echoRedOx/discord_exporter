  content: Hi all, if we had a successful conversation in spanish but also want to
    mark the voter as such for any future calls - is there a way to do both of those
    things? I was able to confirm that they are voting for Harris. Seemed so based
    on searches here but wanted to check. Thank you!

  content: Since the call was successful just mark it that way and in the future if
    he gets a call from someone who doesnt speak spanish then it can be marked that
    way
