  content: How do I make an event affiliated with the DNC for the campaign? Can a
    business also profit from the event, or does it need to solely benefit the DNC?

  content: Campaign finance laws are very strict and don't allow cross fundraising
    between separate campaigns or non-DNC official events. They can't be posted anywhere
    on the server. See rule 3 or our<#1242252810561654925>. You can submit an event
    on https://events.democrats.org but they also have guidelines there for what can
    be approved. All of this is governed by campaign finance law.
