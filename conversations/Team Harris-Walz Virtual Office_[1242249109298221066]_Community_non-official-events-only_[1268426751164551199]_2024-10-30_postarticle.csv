We asked ourselves: Who benefits from Harris being President? 

The answer: Every. Living. Thing.

So we’re offering a collection of free digital artwork for people to download, in both English and Español, that features a wide variety of creatures with a stake in this election.

The call-to-action is simple: print and put up a poster. In your home, at your office, at school, a park, a coffee shop. Somewhere. Anywhere.

We currently have five posters. There are many more creatures to come. 🐿️ 

Here’s our website 👉 https://www.creaturesforkamala.org/ 👈

If you’re into it, please share and put up a poster!"

You might know this already, but just in case you didn't know YouTube recently also added a Community Notes feature, which can help combat misinformation. I believe on the mobile app you can opt in to the waiting list by clicking Settings, then General, then ""Help Inform Viewers.""

She really emphasizes the importance of *voting in all elections* and not just when it’s a presidential race. 

It’s no secret that a Harris/Walz administration will be much **stronger and effective** if backed by the House and Senate majorities. So it goes without saying, volunteering in your local campaigns (in any way you can) will make a huge difference! Even if not local to you! Phone banking for candidates in other states that are trying to unseat Republicans — we can help flip them! Just need to push through and get the message out there! We got this, Joyful Warriors! 💙💙💙

I just got onboarded to VoteRiders, and wow, there are thousands of open cases. So many people need IDs across many states. The organization trains well, gives you the choice of state to help out with (I chose GA since it is a battleground state), and gives you an expense card to use for fees associated with ordering IDs, Birth Certificates, Social Security Cards, etc. for voters. It’s definitely one of the ways I’ll continue volunteering after November as well."

Some examples of the non-official events that can be posted here are: debate parties thrown by volunteers, phone banking/text banking for other candidates, and other types of organizing actions that don't include fundraising. It's also helpful to direct individuals here if they are looking to connect with others on non-official events and actions. You are right that the fundraising explanation can clog up the channel. I think we had a more recent surge of fundraising posts in the last 24 hours. If it starts to be a regular thing we can look for a solution that provides the poster with an explanation, but doesn't take over the channel."

I've heard that they're efficient at turning out voters in general, compared to other tactics, but I want to focus my efforts on increasing Democratic votes. Letter-writing could be a fun activity for me, and it's easier to do during downtime at school because I don't have a laptop. I know they target some groups that are statistically more likely to vote Democratic, but I don't know what they do with voter registration (or how they even have a list of registered voters to send to? they're not a political party)"

Build the power of the disability vote. That means making sure every one of the nearly 👉40 million eligible voters with disabilities is registered and ready to vote and has access to the ballot.

For more information, tools, and resources go to theAmerican Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) website for more info:


What: Build an Accessible Future: Power the Disability Vote
Celebrate Disability Voting Rights Week: September 9 to 13

Disability Voting Rights Week (DVRW) is a nonpartisan movement hosted by the American Association of People with Disabilities and REV UP. DVRW is about advocacy, celebrating community, and building power.

Why:
The disability community makes up an important voting bloc. Disabled voters are a part of every community. Yet, systemic barriers prevent many people with disabilities from accessing their right to vote.

Who:
DVRW was created by grassroots disabled activists. DVRW is a cross-disability, cross-movement week of action. We invite all community members and allies to join us.

How:
DVRW includes: voter registration and education events, candidate forums on disability issues, digital organizing, engaging with elected officials, and creative actions. You can:

Host a Voter Registration or Education Event
Activate your Social Media
Organize a candidate town hall on disability.
Write an op-ed for your local newspaper.
Partner with other disability and voting rights organizations.
Ask your local government leaders to issue a proclamation for Disability Voting Rights Week.
Get Involved:
Go to AAPD's website  Disability Voting Rights Week  “Join the Movement”  - for  Disability Voting Rights Week updates, free social media graphics and messaging in English and Spanish, access to a nationwide calendar of events, and more."

I have some names/organizations you can look up. Not giving links because I don’t want to be warned about the rules and regulations. Third Act is donating up to 30 artisan postcards for free and you can use those with lists from Activate America. Activate America has launched new campaigns this week. You will be on your own for stamps, though. I emailed a contact I have at an organization that provides the postcards and the stamps to see if they are still looking for volunteers. If they do, I will share that info. Lastly, you can DM me if you are interested in a link tree highlighting lion’s share of the postcard campaigns, including some that are budget friendly."

My name is Charlie, and I’m with Movement Labs - we’ve started a new program called Beers and Ballots. It just kicked off last week; we go to bars and offer free beers to anyone who will text five friends and family members in swing states. (If you hit your metrics, volunteers also get a beer at the end of the night!) 

People have been really enthusiastic to talk to us so far; and we’re already partnering with way more bars than we can handle, so we could use volunteers! It’s one of the few ways you can contribute in person in deep blue cities. If you’re interested, here’s a mobilize link to get started: https://mobilize.us/s/cC4j8p

I work for the DC program, so I’m looking for DC volunteers, and the mobilize link is for the DC program; but we’re starting this program in Boston, LA, NY, and Philly as well. So if you have any questions, or want to volunteer from one of the non-DC locations, feel free to send me a DM and I’ll get you connected!"

I've been postcarding for a few years with Reclaim Our Vote, a project of The Center for Common Ground. They focus on inconsistent and new voters of color in voter-suppressed states.  They require that you order and use their postcards (not expensive) and your stamps. 

There's also Postcards to Voters, which has a lot of campaigns all the time, I first worked with them to  elect Doug Jones to the Senate (sigh.)!  And a lot of folks write with Postcards to Swing States, a project of Turnout Pac. 

Below is a postcard I sent to Florida before their primary, and links to the three organizations.

I’m Tyler, and I’m excited to join this community! I’m a content creator with a channel focused on reporting current events from a progressive, democratic perspective. My videos mix witty humor, satire and sharp analysis to poke fun at the GOP and highlight important issues. However, the YouTube algorithm seems to be showing my content to the wrong crowd (lots of MAGA), and I’m hoping to attract more like-minded Democrats and progressives.

I’d really appreciate any support you could offer in helping me reach the right audience! Looking forward to connecting with all of you!

Thanks so much! 😊
