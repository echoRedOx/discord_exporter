So let‚Äôs call this exactly what it is: a brazen attempt at a power grab by special interests, outsiders, and politicians who want to get their way at all costs ‚Äì even if it means removing a powerful Nebraska legacy. 

Remember: How Nebraska awards its electoral votes sets our state apart and unites us. While most other states give all their electoral college votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state, in Nebraska, we can allocate our votes by congressional district. This is a Nebraska tradition because of our deeply nonpartisan heritage that promotes fair representation and boosts participation on Election Day.

Nebraska‚Äôs split electoral vote system has worked for over 30 years, ensuring fair representation for all voters. Returning to a winner-take-all approach would ignore Nebraska‚Äôs diverse voices and political landscape. Our current system ensures that urban and rural areas are represented fairly, fosters greater voter engagement, and prevents any one party from monopolizing our state‚Äôs electoral votes. This system has given Nebraska unique influence on the national stage, and there‚Äôs no valid reason to abandon a method that empowers all voters and preserves fairness."

The story is being covered nationally, on Democracy Docket and Axios, so far. Not how you want to make national news, my cornhusking friends! 

For some really good mileage on your call to representatives, I would suggest Sen. McDonnell. As of last night, he was still a no. He used to be a Democrat and switched after being censured for his support for abortion bans and intolerance of trans people. BUT he really wants to be mayor of Omaha. Deatbeat Mayor Stothert came out yesterday and said she‚Äôs in support of winner-take-all, again striking a contrast with McDonnell.

McDonnell has a strong union history, and voting to take away Omaha‚Äôs voice in national elections won‚Äôt go over well.
