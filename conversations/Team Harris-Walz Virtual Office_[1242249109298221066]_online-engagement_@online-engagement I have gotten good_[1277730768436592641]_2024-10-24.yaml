  content: Thanks I did it really did not help. I even went to the democratic agenda
    website and unfortunately there is no mention of doing anything with Ss and Medicare.
    Is there an agenda that is laid out, as this is the biggest thing I am running
    into, trying to prove Kamala has a plan but still cannot find one. This is were
    the difficultly lays in trying to find concrete evidence that she has laid out
    details on her agenda

    \ very frustrated now, how can I engage when there is no agenda spelled out. Since\

  content: Erik, I totally get your frustration and will make sure this is seen by
    our content team! The Vice President remains a big supporter of Social Security
    and Medicaid and plans to not only protect them but to expand them as well. I
    am not sure this is will be helpful but I have shared this piece with people and
    I seem to get very good enagagment! https://app.reach.vote/library/content/4584b3b3-cb6c-4b81-8ab7-81623ae117a3?campaign=democrats

  content: "Thanks, but sending me reach links does not help, u might also want to\
    \ see my post on general conversation, there are flyers that my in-laws get almost\
    \ everyday they have told me not one Kamala flyer. Sending me links to Reach does\
    \ not help, I already have thoroughly look at most thing again if I have no agenda,\
    \ backing it up why would I post. Thanks but I think for right now I am going\
    \ to wait for her agenda otherwise there\u2019s no real reason in posting if I\
    \ can\u2019t back up the post thanks let me know when she gets an agenda and then\
    \ I will begin my online engagement again"
