Content: Will the campaign be doing any training or communication about volunteering opportunities on election day (or even the day before), and how they might differ from other days? I'm guessing some people get the day off, or are taking it off, and may want to volunteer and plan ahead. (I may not be working, so I'm curious for myself, but this seems like something that others' might be interested in too.) Feel free to let me know if this should be directed elsewhere too!

Content: Hi Dana! If you have time on Election Day, there will be lots of volunteer opportunities - the same stuff we are doing today, but more so! During the past few months we have been identifying supporters, and the goal from now through Election Day is to make sure every one of those supporters actually gets to the polls. 

If you are able to get to a swing state for that day, the local Democratic Party office may have additional opportunities for you like canvassing, poll observing, or driving people to the polls - check with a local office in the state you would be able to get to.
