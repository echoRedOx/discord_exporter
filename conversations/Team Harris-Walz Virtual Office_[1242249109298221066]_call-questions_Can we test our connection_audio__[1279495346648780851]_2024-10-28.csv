Is there any way we can test out our connection. I'm using my computer to make the calls and would really prefer to keep doing that. I'm using a good microphone and headphones with a decent internet connection."

One possible solution is to try leaving the Zoom (if you are still in it). I was on a training the other day and they said zoom can mess with the audio."
