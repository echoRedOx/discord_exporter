  content: I just reached someone who I could hear clearly at first, but then after
    I asked who she was supporting, there was just silence, which kind of dragged
    on until I ended the call. Is that  a busy/callback? Does this ever happen with
    the dialer, that the connection just goes silent?

    I would mark it as a refused.
