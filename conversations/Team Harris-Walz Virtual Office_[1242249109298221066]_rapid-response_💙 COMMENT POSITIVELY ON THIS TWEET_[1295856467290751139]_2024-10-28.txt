Content: Today, Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are announcing a plan for rural America. The key elements will:

-Increase access to affordable and high-quality health care in rural communitiesâ€”by adding 10,000 health care professionals, expanding telemedicine, cutting the number of ambulance deserts in half.

-Support the sandwich generation to care for elders at home, lowering the cost of childcare and increasing the number of providers, and expanding the Child Tax Credit to provide tax cuts up to $6,000 for families with newborns.

-Lower the costs of buying a home, starting and expanding a business, and raising a familyâ€”by sparking the construction of 3 million new housing units, providing up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, increasing the small business tax deduction for startup expenses 10-fold to $50,000.

-Invest in the future of American agriculture by boosting access to credit, land, and markets, building new markets and streams of income for small- and mid-sized farmers and producers, and supporting the rise of the next generation of American farmers and ranchers.

Donald Trump will turn back the hard-earned progress that rural communities are making. As President, he tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act and vows to terminate it if reelected, stripping protections from people with pre-existing conditions and devastating rural hospitals and care services. He will ban abortion nationwide, threaten access to contraception and IVF, and force states to monitor womenâ€™s pregnancies and report womenâ€™s miscarriages and abortions to the federal government.
