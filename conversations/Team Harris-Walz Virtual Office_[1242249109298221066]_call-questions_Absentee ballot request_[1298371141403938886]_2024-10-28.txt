Content: I had an elderly caller in Wisconsin who said she was not going to be able to vote because she can’t get around too well. She is a strong democrat and would like to vote for straight Dem. I told her 10/31 was the last day to request absentee. She does not have access to online resources to make the absentee ballot request. I’ve called both State and Local County Dem orgs to give them her info, but they all are voicemails and answering machines (that’s a different problem in itself two weeks away from an election), but I need to get someone her info that can help her request an absentee ballot. I have her name and address, if a volunteer could possibly go help her, but I need someone to contact to give it to. She lives in the Milwaukee suburbs, Brown Deer. This should happen today.

Content: We can't take a voter's personal information. Tell her to call her local board of elections to request an absentee ballot.
