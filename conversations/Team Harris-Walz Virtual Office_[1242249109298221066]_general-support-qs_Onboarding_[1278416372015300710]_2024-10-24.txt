Content: I have tried to get onboarded with Mod Nicole Morris. I explained I took the training yesterday, took, signed the agreeement abd passed the quiz yesterday as Emily Freeman CA. My zoom account goes through my gmail name which is E. L. Freeman.  So I would like to get texting and was a text captain for Biden 2020, plus active on Team Newsom.  Can you get this straightened out please.
