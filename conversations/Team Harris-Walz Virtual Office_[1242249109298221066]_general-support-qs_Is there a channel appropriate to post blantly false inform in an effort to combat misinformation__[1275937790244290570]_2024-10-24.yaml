  content: Hi Steven, I appreciate what you're asking. There isn't a channel for this,
    and I'm not sure how we could do it and avoid confusing some folks. And there's
    potential for someone here to share it somewhere else in ways that might be damaging.
    But we'll think about it.

  content: I appreciate your response Carolyn.  Many of the folks from the places
    wher this information is coming from (right biased social media) that see this
    misinformation are not going to vote for Dems anyways, but there is always hope
    that some folks could change their minds and in such a close election, I feel
    my talents would be useful for getting the word out.  Obviously there are unaffiliated  channels
    like social media, etc.  And, I am hoping to understand how the campaign is doing
    fight this battle and how I might help with.

    here where people can report misinformation.  After 4 years of combatting misinfrmation,
    much of it already has been identified, but it''s good to have a reporting system
    so that the people who have algorithms and network analysis can have the data.'

  content: I don't think that misinformation should be made into memes. However, correct
    information should be made into images and memes. There is another DNC based group
    here on Discord that is specifically taksed with creating images.

  content: At this time, there are organizations dedicated to addressing some specific
    forms of misinformation. In order to spread accurate information on voter suppression,
    for example, look at Rick Hasen's websites and twitter X pages, media interviews,
    media, etc. He and other scholars of election law have a blog called Election
    Law Blog.  Rick Hasen is nationally the best expert.

    The problem is: Meta''s platforms are blocking Reach''s factual content.  The
    campaign is aware of this problem, but there''s no workaround (to get Reach''s
    content around Meta''s flagging process).  So the OE Team has been finding *the
    process* difficult to amplify factual messaging to other Meta users.'
