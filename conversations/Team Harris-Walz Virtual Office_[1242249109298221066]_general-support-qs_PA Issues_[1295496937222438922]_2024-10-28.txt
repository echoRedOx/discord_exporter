Content: Hi I’m writing PC’s for PA. 
There’s a suggestion to add one issue from Pennsylvania for the postcard. Could someone suggest what that one issue could be?

Content: Hi <@1283943183830487139> - Any postcard related info needs to go through the State Democratic Party.  I will tag you in that channel with the state dem website etc. I will also add PA to your profile, so that you can see the channel.
