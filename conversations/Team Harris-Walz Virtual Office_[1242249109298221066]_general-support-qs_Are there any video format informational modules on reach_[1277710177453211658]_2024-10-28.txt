Content: Hi <@958039986672910376>  the Reach app if very user friendly and I'm sure you will figure it out in a couple minutes of using it. Let me know after you try it and I can make you a walkthrough it you need it. Also take a quick look at this overview. https://www.reach.vote/knowledge-base/home-screen/

Content: Can we get an updated Act Blue link & graphic for Facebook & Instagram?  The July 20th Facebook is the most recent that I’ve been able to find.  I would like updated graphics with link as soon as possible so folk can spread it before the Sept 10th debate.  Can we get both Facebook & Instagram as soon as possible?  Can you also post it in REACH?  It takes a while for it to be shared “far & wide,” and you can even track donations collected during the debate.  Thanks!
