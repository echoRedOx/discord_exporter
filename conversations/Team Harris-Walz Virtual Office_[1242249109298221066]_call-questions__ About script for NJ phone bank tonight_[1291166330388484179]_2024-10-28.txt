Content: The script includes the PA Senate race but that didn't come up in the training- are we talking to voters about that or no?

Content: Ok, yes I see that particular event.  I do not have the script for that but I suspect if you are calling into PA tonight there is an ask about their voting intention for Senate.  This would be consistent with similar language we are using in DNC phone banks for PA.
