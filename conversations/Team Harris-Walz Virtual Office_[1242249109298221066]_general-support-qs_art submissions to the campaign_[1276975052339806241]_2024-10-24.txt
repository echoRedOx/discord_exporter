Content: <@&1245831457818279986> <@&1266883962727432304> , I have a question: A professional artist friend created a poster of Kamala and would like to give the campaign full rights to use it. She asked me to find out the right process to do this. Can someone advise? I can connect the appropriate person to her directly. Thanks!
