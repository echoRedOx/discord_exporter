    goes too fast, both audio and video.

  content: Hi, <@1278086822068621362>  I understand, and think the video goes a bit
    fast, myself.  Are you able to stop, rewind, review?  If not, you can always go
    into a Phone Bank for their instructions at the top of a session, then you will
    be set to make calls on your schedule once we roll out Anytime Dialing.  The Phone
    Banks also have people there to help you with any tech issues you may have, and
    there is a practice room where you can try things out before you start making
    live calls.  I hope this helps.  Thanks for being here.  Every person making calls
    for Kamala is important.  Phone Banking has proven to increase voter turnout by
    3.8% and that can make the difference in a swing district/state.
