I'm new to political campaigns and am really worried about Trump getting back in power. I want to do everything I can to prevent that. I'm excited about Kamala's chances and want to help.

I've noticed a lack of yard signs for Harris/Walz in my area, and it's been bugging me to see mostly trump signs going up. I'm thinking of ordering 100-500 signs to put up around Lansdale (Hatfield, Skippack, Blue Bell, Montgomeryville). I have no experience with this and would need people to take care of everything other than getting the signs.

I'm looking to gauge interest and thoughts on whether it's a good idea. I've heard signs aren't that effective, but it really does bug me. It just doesn't look great at this point."

* H/W's /issues page states that no one making more than $400K will pay more taxes. In contrast, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center (to name one such group opposing Trumponomics 2024) says Trump's plan to make his earlier tax cuts (for rich people) would increase the national debt by more than $4 trillion over the next 10 years, and *increase* taxes for 13% of middle-income Americans. 
* On prices, the H/W agenda calls out ""anti-competitive practices that let big corporations jack up prices and undermine the competition."" This is where the issues lie‚Äîcorporate greed. In general I have been really excited to hear both H and W talk about shifting some of the power away from corporations and back to workers. Like, they spend a *lot* of time on it. Also: Walz is not rich‚Äîhe doesn't even own stock‚Äîso he likely goes to the supermarket himself sometimes and knows first-hand. 

Personally neither of the above is my #1 reason for backing H/W‚Äîmy top reasons are ""won't sell out to dictators"" and ""won't become a dictator""‚Äîbut I thought about what my Western PA dad would complain about."

In the cases I know they even get paid their normal pay rate not the tiny stipend poll workers receive.   Some buy food for the crew with the stipend so everyone has enough energy to power through at the end of a long long day.

Even if one or two of you are able to make it in to PA for an earlier canvass, I feel like often that is the best way to really get connected. By going on a ‚Äúscouting mission‚Äù you can meet the organizers in the field office, exchange phone numbers, get the lay of the land, and be able to maximize your organizing. If you‚Äôre unable to do that, another route could be to try to join a phone bank through the campaign in PA and you may similarly be able to connect with someone who can help you with planning.

Thanks for making efforts.   General population phone/text banking might be great for you or canvassing.   And within that maybe certain types work best for you (GOTV for known supporters‚Ä¶ or what not).   Keep it up, when we fight ‚Ä¶.

I read further and see the feeling sick points you make‚Ä¶ the reach app has tons of materials and I found it can be useful to read those to help refine my understanding of campaign messaging on a broader set of topics.   I also used it to find folks that were (potentially) not registered that I knew‚Ä¶. Thus not hard sells on influencing their vote.  In the few detailed conversations phonebanking being able to search the reach app sure helped me speak better to specific concerns.

IOW Can use the sick time to prepare to succeed.  And try out tools/group-zoom-training  to hit the ground running when voice recovers."

The texting training session seemed to flop unfortunately.  I received an email later on the evening asking for an indication on how I felt it went -- but there never was any visible way to join the session in the first place; doubtlessly I have missed a critical step and will need to try again.

I hope to be able to phone bank soon -- at the moment though my poor throat is very upset with the world. ü´†  Is why I was attempting to find the texting session.

Electioneering is allowed 10 feet from the polling place.  The polling place‚Äôs outer boundary; rarely is that the door to the building facing outside from what I have seen but could be.   But usually there is a second door in places like a government center.  So that leads to really close activities.

The electioneering activities can‚Äôt be seen or heard from within the voting area of the polling place as well.   And folks can‚Äôt obstruct passage in/out of building.

But state election laws wise it‚Äôs pretty permissive compared to the norms I‚Äôd accumulated from other areas.

Still useful to contact and discuss with local Dem or elections teams whenever you see something suspect though.     

A tent on sidewalk that is needed/intended for public walkway probably is an issue if not permitted/accepted ‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôd not be an election-specific issue unless it hindered passage to polling place."

I do not have great pointers to folks organizing for that specifically and hope you find some, folks asking similar questions for other parts of PA in weeks past have gotten things in order; you can search earlier messages on this channel.   But be sure to check mobilize and consider rideshare2vote.   Within mobilize the 2024pavictory group and Hadley ( https://www.mobilize.us/hadleyhaas2024/ ) are good ones to check.  There have been events in-advance for out of state volunteers held online‚Ä¶ have been helpful for folks.  

The 6024 broad st Pittsburgh, pa office is very active and I believe would take all helping hands.

As well there are county senior citizen housing towers around the region which I‚Äôve dropped food off to share in the past and suspect those locations would be great places to pick folks up and take to the polls.  For food at least the message gets out fast through informal grape vine by talking to a few folks in lobby.

I‚Äôd strongly recommend doing phonebanking or texting in advance of travel to an area so you‚Äôre refining your voice and hearing more from a given state.

Good luck, hope those ideas help in the mean time‚Ä¶ and that you get more-specific info from someone else."
