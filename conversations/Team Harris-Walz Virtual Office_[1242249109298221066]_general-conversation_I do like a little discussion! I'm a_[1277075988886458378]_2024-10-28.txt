Content: People will certainly say things on text that they may not say on the phone. I try to remind myself that they don't know anything about me or even that it is me! ðŸ™‚ On the phone bank, there is an option to end the call if people get too spicy!

Content: good point! from the training today it also seems that texting is a little more paint by numbers so to speak, which might make it a bit easier. with phone you have to be a little more responsive to waht hte person is saying, a little more room to shorten a script if the person's attention seems like it's waning, etc.

Content: Totally - I think texting is really helpful in reminding people to register to vote, but phone is better for having real conversations!

Content: yeah I can see how each one would be better for different purposes! seems to me reminder-type stuff would be best over text. persuasion is more a phone thing in my (limitedly informed at this point) view
