Content: Hi <@260982275506700288>. Thanks for the question. While I don't have that answer for you as we're focused on Online Engagement here, one of our <@&1245831457818279986>s may be able to assist you with an answer. (You can usually reach them through <#1242249109298221069> or <#1267941954243526756>.) In my experience shopping there, some sold out material did eventually return while other pieces did NOT.

Content: My order was recieved. However, I've noticed that some items now are sold out or noted as not available until a certain date. Was your item one of those that ships later perhaps? Regardless, I won't have any answers for you as an Online Engagement Lead. You may wish to contact a general <@&1266883962727432304>. (FYI: The <#1269677234357010522> section is new and awesome! )

Content: I would think with the popularity of the campaign, they're having a hard time keeping up. The same thing happened with Fetterman two years ago.

Content: Yes, Jessica and Marie are correct. They have various shipping dates for different items and many don't ship until September. Depends on the items. They likely do this to produce larger runs so the campaign gets to keep more money for campaigning rather than product. You might check the receipt and/or item/s on the website to see if it lists the shipping date/s. They often do.

Content: I've also heard they are producing much of it, if not all of it, by U.S. labor union companies. 🙂

Content: Most Democratic campaigns use US union labor for these things. I know the DNC uses it for the stuff they sell on the party's website since I have the donkey coffee cup from that.

Content: And I’ll add - both of the items that I ordered state Ships within 10 days. I’m not complaining. Just wondering if anyone else received their orders!

Content: Like I said I have a feeling what's going on is something very similar to what the Fetterman campaign experienced in 2022 when they became so popular that their online store got slammed with orders that it took slightly longer than expected for a lot of items. Check back periodically. Also, if you get the Shop app on your phone, you can probably get notifications that way too because that's how I got a lot of notifications on DNC gear I ordered a few times.

Content: I placed my order on July 30. I understand- there is so much excitement about this campaign. I didn’t follow Fetterman as much (I’m in California.) Thank you for the response!
