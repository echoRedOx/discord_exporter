  content: <@1268161496441946215> - Found it. This social platform training is focused
    on creating your own unofficial groups, so that allows you more latitude in what
    you share within reason. Of course, all is still bound by community agreements
    and the spirit of the campaign, but you can share unofficial stuff from affinity
    groups more freely for example. https://events.democrats.org/event/683653/
