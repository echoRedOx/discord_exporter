  content: Can you share links to sign up to phone banks where you're just calling
    volunteers and not voters, e.g. recruiting people or confirming shifts?

  content: So unfortunately, our lists change based on what the campaign needs for
    the day, so sometimes its voter calls, sometimes its volunteer recruitment, etc.
    However, I am fairly sure (but not positive) that we will be continuing doing
    confirmation/recruitment calls to wisconsin voters asking them to attend the rally
    with VP Harris and Gov. Walz tomorrow, if you want to sign up for one of tomorrow's
    shifts.
