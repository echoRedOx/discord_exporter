  content: "Hi, I posted in <#1242249109298221069> the other day that I felt ill-equipped\
    \ on talking points on a number of issues when phone banking. It would be helpful\
    \ to have a compilation of issues to take about and evidence to bring up. For\
    \ example project 2025 came up with a PA Trump voter I spoke to on Sunday and\
    \ I brought up that while Trump has tried to distance himself from the plan former\
    \ Trump staffers contributed to the plan and JD Vance wrote the foreword for it\
    \ but I forgot that Trump has praised the Heritage foundation in the past. And\
    \ I was unclear myself on many details of the plan. \nI would find a list of issues\
    \ and key points super helpful and I\u2019d love to contribute if there\u2019\
    s anything interest in that."

  content: "I believe they are working on getting us further talking points like this\
    \ but there are some in the call dialer. I think there are also some good overviews\
    \ of P25 talking points online and there are some graphics in <#1250876565366243348>\
    \ that may be helpful to review as well. \n\nP25 was quite literally designed\
    \ by mostly Trump cabinet and staff people. Stephen Miller is also a huge part\
    \ of it and he's like Gargamel from the Smurfs. Very anti-human and immigration/asylum.\
    \ And very extreme. The history of The Heritage Foundation and so many scholarly\
    \ \"conservative think thanks\" goes back even further than Trump. \n\nThere's\
    \ been this movement since Scopes Monkey Trial and creationism being relabeled\
    \ as \"intelligent design\" and they all have a \"dear leader\" in Trump. They\
    \ are behind the huge push to eradicate true history and science from the education\
    \ department."

  content: Hi Jeremy and Ophelia! Yes, Ophelia is correct that we are in process of
    getting talking points for you when making calls, and that we do have some already
    in the dialer sidebar. We will be sure to let you all know when we have more talking
    points on various issues available for you to use when on calls!

  content: Hi <@1257469301435400238>, LMK if you need volunteer help researching and
    drafting talking points. Sitting over here in Germany itching to help (I was a
    journalist and copywriter in a past life, and have a law degree so can distill
    the policy stuff into succinct language + create outlines highlighting key info).

  content: "Hey Jeremy, one of the lovely people in here made this website to make\
    \ it easier to navigate P2025. If you click on an issue, it will show you what\
    \ the plan says about the issue and what page it is on. For example, I clicked\
    \ drug prices, and on page 465, it says that the plan is to repeal the Inflation\
    \ Reduction Act\u2019s drug price negotiation program in Medicare along with reduce\
    \ the government share in the catastrophic tier of Medicare Part D and require\
    \ manufacturers to bear a larger share. It will also directly link you to the\
    \ page it is on so you can read the page and come to your own conclusions.\n\n\

    all of the P25 issues, and where specifically to find the mention to these issues
    in the 900+ page document. Bookmarked now.
