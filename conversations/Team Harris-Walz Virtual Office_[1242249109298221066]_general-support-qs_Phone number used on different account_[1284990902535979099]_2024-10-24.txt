Content: I went through all of my emails. None were signed up. I tried logging in with my # and hit forgot password - my boyfriend created an account in his name with my only number Iâ€™ve had for years. I tried getting a free number through text now, but that also wonâ€™t work because is a voip. I deleted the boyfriendâ€™s account, and Iâ€™ve included the screenshot of that. It was suggested that I ask here and possibly get a family memberâ€™s number in the meantime. Any idea when that will actually delete? I have been loving text banking and I do not want to lose my account! Is there another account if this isnâ€™t the one thatâ€™s blocking me from verification?

Content: I used a family memberâ€™s number for now. I will update that when the other account deletes.

Content: Hi <@734999912013496321> it takes 2 weeks for a Discord account to delete. You can use a family member's phone number on your account for two weeks and then change it to your own phone after the other account is deleted.
