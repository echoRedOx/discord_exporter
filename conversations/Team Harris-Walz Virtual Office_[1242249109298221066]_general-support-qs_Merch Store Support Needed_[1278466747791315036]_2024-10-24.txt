Content: Hi,

One of the Mods directed me here for assistance.

I have twice tried using the web form on the Harris Merch Store for support, and I have responded to a promotional email and text from them. Could you help me directly connect?

Order Problem: Wrong Size
Order Number: 205245

Received M but asked for XL.
Item is out of stock. Hoping an XL.was.returned or that product (Madam President hoodie) will be reordered. 

Please advise on next steps.

Thanks!
