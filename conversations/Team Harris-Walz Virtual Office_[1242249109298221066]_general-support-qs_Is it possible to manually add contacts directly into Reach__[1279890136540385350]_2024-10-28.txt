Content: I hope this is the right place to ask. I'm finding Reach very difficult. I put in a friend complete with address and I get back 33 matches, none of which are in the state I entered. Is there a way for me to manually enter new contacts and their survey results, etc.?

Content: Hi <@816713323272732704> have you tried putting less information in the Reach search? I put just your name and MA, only one person popped up, I'm pretty sure it's you. Try your friend's name and their zip code. See that helps

Content: Thanks. I take it there is no way to just enter a new contact from scratch without Reach finding it. Oh well. Thanks again.

Content: Yes! You can import from the contacts that are stored on your phone.
Tap My Reach (bottom-center) and swipe through it's little tutorial and after that you can connect
