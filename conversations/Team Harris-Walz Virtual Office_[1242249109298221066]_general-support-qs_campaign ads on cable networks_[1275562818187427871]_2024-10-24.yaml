  content: <@1267620032393773197> Why are some ads not public on the [campaign's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@kamalaharris/videos
    )?  Can Reach add [a gallery](https://app.reach.vote/library/galleries?campaign=democrats)
    for ads?

  content: That's a great question! We try to get all of the ads up on Reach as we
    possibly can and I will relay the suggestion for a gallery for ads to folks on
    our team!

  content: Thanks!  I know that ads not uploaded on the campaign's YouTube would usually
    be posted on the campaign's social media, but that's harder to find among the
    campaign's many accounts on each platform.  When I share from the campaign's social
    media to *another* platform though, the shared ad loses its "play" button (because
    of technical issues with embedding to another platform).

  content: Wisconsin's campaign has a gallery for [campaign advertisements](https://app.reach.vote/library/gallery/69efe227-6a0d-4758-adc9-546cdc5af1d2?campaign=wisconsin).  (They
    also have a gallery for "Veterans & Military Families".)
