Content: Hey hey, Colorado folks! Did you know we can watch the Harris/Walz rally in a couple of hours in nearby Nevada? It's a packed house and they even moved venues to accommodate more folks! It's scheduled to start in just over 2.5 hours, and that may change as we get closer. Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDcXZp4Vi4Y

Content: The script is just a suggestion - except for the bolded bits where the "ask" of the phone call is defined. Don't be a robot ü§ñ 

This is what I learned in my last phone-bank facilitator training. Thank you for phone banking!!! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Previously voted absentee from all over the world as a Florida resident (our "home of record" with the Army) for the past 13+ years but now I'm ecstatic (and relieved) to be a legal CO resident, registered and ready to do my part to paint this town lavender, elect Kamala, and codify rights to marriage and abortion in this state's constitution! <:bluewave3:1270555729836900453>

Content: For you Jeffco folks (and maybe others). Try New Era Colorado. https://neweracolorado.org/about-us/ . They do registration on campus'. They strongly prefer young volunteers who are peers  (or close) with University students. If that's you, contact them.

Content: Hello from Littleton. I am on the text team. Woot woot! What's everyone else doing this weekend to get out the vote?

Was upset to see that 2 neighboring houses up the street had signs stolen. I like to think we're immune from that Foolishness here in purple country, but I guess not.

Content: Hey, Colorado pals! I learned via the Women for Harris Wednesdays event last week that you can put their special QR code on your phone (or make your own) and help people register to vote anywhere and anytime. How neat is that? So far, everyone I've asked (while in public) says they're registered and plan to vote, but just in case ... I'm ready to register people on the fly ... since there don't seem to be any voter reg events in my county (Jeffco). ** edited 9/17/24 to remove the QR code. Sorry about that, pals. I didn't realize they could be altered / sketchy.

I'm not aware of any virtual opportunities at the moment (but you can always search https://events.democrats.org) but you can also sign-up to join the door knocking squad for CO Victory! https://events.democrats.org/event/670843/ - There may be more as we get closer to the Get out the Vote time of the election. Have you already signed up to phone bank?

Content: Good Morning, Colorado neighbors! We got our big blue book over the weekend, and it's a beast this year. I'm a little worried about all those propositions maybe supressing voters this year! It feels like a massive slog to figure them all out, and (obviously) I'm an highly engaged voter. 

Also, I'm a longtime journalist in the pet / veterinary space, and I have *opinions on Prop 129 (the veterinary professional associates) ... if you have any questions. üòâ

Content: The short version is that it likely will NOT create the results it claims such as lowering veterinary costs for families. It appears to be for the benefit of the big venture cap / private equity firms that now own a lot of the big veterinary companies that own a lot of veterinary hospitals around the country. It *might lower *their costs since they'll likely hire fewer veterinarians, but I really doubt they will pass along the savings to us. It also may suppress the income / career potential for veterinary technicians and veterinarians already working in the profession and into the future. Many in the profession have pet safety concerns too, but for me ... knowing where the $$ behind it comes from makes me wary. At first I thought, huh ... that's an interesting idea, but after reading more about it from people I respect ... I'm personally voting no. I can DM you some links if you want to read more about it.

Content: Can we please start giving people volunteering in the office(s) access to this app? I am running into volunteers who don‚Äôt know that they can be call banking at almost all hours of the day.

It would be great to make as many people as possible who came to the watch party know about this app and that they can be volunteering for the majority of hours of the day‚Ä¶

We need as many hands on deck as possible! 
Please challenge them to invite and get as many people as possible to join the app from the watch parties and who are already volunteering as possible.

Content: Someone I know out in a very red part of CA keeps getting signs stolen, so they coat the edges of the signs in vaseline and glitter. They also added more signs to make clear there's video footage of it. Ha!

Also ... are you related at all to Susan Stecklein? We went to HS together and  reconnected at our 30th reunion in 2016 (before the election). We met up a couple times after that, but then life gets busy, as I'm sure you nkow.

Content: CO-4 is a vital race for me personally. I don't want Lauren embarrassing our state nationally anymore and I'd love to flip this district. The majority of our work is on swing-states for the Harris-Walz campaign, but every election matters as Jack said!

Content: Funny. Happy to report the kids are alright. I texted one of my early-20-something nieces a pic of my ballot, and she replied that she's filling out her ballot soon, she also added a funny expletive about the other guy. üòÜ  When she was little, everyone called her my Mini Me because she was SO much like me as a kid.

Content: Same! We are so lucky we live here where it's done so well. I do worry about people pressured by household members to vote otherwise because it's harder to keep your vote secret, but I hope those people figure out a way to do it.

Content: Tell me you're gearing up for GOTV without telling me you're gearing up for GOTV. 

After physical therapy today, I popped over to Costco to start laying in my stockpile of GOTV snacks. I also got myself some flowers. Since we live in the foothills, we can't even get a pizza delivered up here. A gal needs to plan ahead, including a big chocolate cake.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: Yeah, I feel that. You'd be surprised though, a lot of people still do. I initially thought it would be generational, but even with that I get folks of all ages so ü§∑

Content: Hi <@1299635674898763778> ! Sorry it took us a bit to respond. You can head over to <#1298623273566732300>! (If you have any trouble seeing that, you can go to the server settings bar (in the upper left hand corner of your screen if you're on your computer) and click "show all channels." Also, have you thought about phone banking? It's super easy - many folks actually prefer it to texting! - and it's the campaign's number one priority right now. You can get started with that by going to <#1242256751445934262> (if you can't see that one, go to <id:customize> and add 'talk to volunteers in key states'). How would you like to get started volunteering? So happy to have you joining our team!

Content: I am in Denver & contemplating driving down to Albuquerque (and the Vote Save America op there) 
or direct to Phoenix to hook up with AZ GOTV canvasing (and maybe rides-to-polls?) operations from Friday to ... probably Wednesday? 
(but I could be convinced to look at just weekend if the man-hour tradeoffs make sense)

I have 3 to 4 other seats in my car if anyone else from Denver area (or elsewhere along I-25 corridor?) would like a ride to also do so [either from early am Fri or maybe Thur]

Content: That ABQ -> Phoenix bus is now full according to mobilize (I signed up, but others might not be able to); 

I have reached out to various relevant folks about the possibility/use of additional car of folks from Denver (possible via ABQ if it will let couple more people go from there as well)

Content: alas, campaign pulled funding from this operation ; 

they do still need people, and I am willing to make the drive to Phoenix 

but I'd / we'd need to pay for a hotel or airbnb or whatever (and currently i have more free time than extra funds personally)
