Content: @here EVERYBODY HERE CRUSHED IT:

We pushed out **85** individual posts for amplification, and have had over 168m impressions on tweets with #OnBoardWithBiden !!

The best things we can do in the coming hours and days:
- Post as much content about Trump being unhinged as possible
- Continue to push out Project 2025 content, to show just how Dangerous Trump is
- Contrast the different between Trump + Biden - a dangerous felon vs. a public servant

Content: If Trump had actually talked about the things he wants to do then it might have changed things in his favor with more Republicans or Independents.  But he is who he is and he can't help but keep saying all his lies. 2 more debates like this and he will only lose more voters. Biden just needs to keep repeating all his accomplishments and ignore what Trump is saying.

Content: I can tell you that the content creation team has been working a lot on memes. I also do support a lot of it because when I worked on the Fetterman campaign, we were a total meme machine. To be honest, I think that was why John Fetterman had a huge draw among the youth vote.

Content: We should still enable people to read he whole thing because it covers so much. For example, I only recently read what it proposed to cut for service members and veterans. That wasn't listed in any abbreviated versions that I've seen and is very serious. That could influence the vote of millions of service members, veterans, and their families. https://www.stopthecoup2025.org/chapter-breakdown

Content: The webpage that Biden's campaign created about Project 2025 links to the 900+ page report (even I didn't bother to read).  However, I do have leisure time to read a 16-page Platform that's getting [positive press](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/08/rnc-platform-national-abortion-limits-00166788) for Trump's edits.

Content: It leaves too much out. We need to flood social media with as much information as possible. People don't know what they don't know, so we have to inform them. With the chapter breakdown, you can go straight to the chapters that interest you. For example, I am a veteran, and I wouldn't have known what they want to do to veterans and service members if I hadn't read that chapter.

Content: Courtesy of a bilingual friend... Samples of ads and social media content from France that seem like solid concepts:

Choosing between a mediocre TV dinner and a nicely-present turd.
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C885hz2oXn8/
Looks at the turd: "You have to admit, it's well presented, with some red, white and blue."
Looks at the frozen dinner: "I heard in the press that the dressing really wasn't that great. And I'm told that it costs too much."

A pitch to the youth.
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8aDIk0irmk/
"We're not asking you to choose the love of your life, but to take the bus with them."
"It's better to be frustrated with the left, even if it's imperfect, than it is to find yourself alone against fascism."

Content: I could use more immediate and current Action Cards over in Reach. Like today‚Äôs NATO news, e.g.  For IG and FB. Good 12 sec. video clips showing Biden DOING HIS JOB rather than answering questions on whether he can or not.

Content: Clooney's opinion is titled: "I love Joe Biden".  As a Democrat himself, my question is if he wants to run.

Content: I'm not paying attention to half of them really. I actually reposted one thing from Rob Reiner and said, "And then what do we do?" I mean, they haven't thought that far, did they? I think not. PS. I think the fact that Mike Pence came out saying that he does not support Trump speaks louder volumes but that's just me.

Content: <@941196169852366859> oh my goodness to see those results in 2016. Just wondering is the current campaign very aware of what went wrong in 2016 and in 2020 did a good job in preventing it.

Content: Fortunately, most of Pence's voters have already left the GOP.  Despite Haley endorsing Trump, Biden's campaign is reaching out to her [#NeverTrump group of Republicans](https://www.voterbridge.org/haley-voters-policy-priorities).

Content: That whole thing with Haley shocks me. I'm like, "He basically badmouthed you and you're still backing him?!" I mean, even Chris Christie grew a backbone and went against Trump! Which is probably why I respect Chris Christie a little more these days.

Content: My community map includes Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Nextdoor.  I participated in the Michigan Dem Party‚Äôs Disinformation Program a couple of years ago, and shared their posts and graphics, in addition to my own posts on social media. I specifically created a subreddit and community group on Nextdoor to increase awareness.  So I plan to use all of the above mentioned to help spread awareness and combat disinformation for this year‚Äôs election.

Content: We must keep the fight for health care. Joe Biden is for aca the other guy well you know he wants to hit it. Joe Biden is for social security a vital program for me well if other guy is elected this mainstay benefit could be changed not for the good. Biden is totally qualified and doing vital work for our nation. While other guy lies about everything including his golf game

Content: To beat Trump, voters will need to be more disturbed by what a second Trump term portends than any foibles of the Democratic ticket. "All the Best People" is a stark reminder from unprecedented numbers of people who served in "Trump I" who left sounding the alarm, like Press Secretary Stepanie Grisham. Her story is especially compelling because she joined the Administration as a "true believer" but left denouncing Trump as "the ultimate con man" and warning that a second term would be "nothing but revenge, retribution and how he can benefit himself."

Her story is linked below. Please watch and if you approve, kindly Like and Share the links across as many platforms as possible.

Content: My suggestion to everyone is what Kate said in the online engagement announcements and I also have a few suggestions as someone who has been in this game for a while now. 
1. Use reputable sources whether they be from our guidance and staffers or from a source with clout. Good examples of news outlets if anyone's looking to share that are sources like Reuters and the Associated Press since they are wire services and therefore they don't have any of the bias we're seeing from many of the big ones like CNN. 
2. Don't use any inflammatory language. This is not just because we're taking the Michelle Obama, "They go low, we go high" approach right now but also because of something called slander. If you don't know anything about that, I do encourage you to look it up. We're trying to avoid anything that will make us look like a bunch of jagoffs basically.
3. I know this is a crazy time but there's a reason why we're taking the approach we are right now and since I'm a bit of a social science nerd on top of having knowledge of Communication and media, I think what we're trying to do it take an approach of speak softly and carry a big stick. Now I know Teddy Roosevelt was saying, "Oh, I'll use the military if I have to" basically but in the digital world it's more like, "We're going to post that uplifting content and show we mean it when we say that we want to unite the nation but we'll also remind you that our opponents are horrible people."

In other words: use reputable sources, present the facts like we always did, and for the love of God...KEEP YOUR LANGUAGE CIVIL! You guys are doing great so far so let's just keep breaking through the noise and show that we're nothing like these people that are causing all the fighting, division, and hate. Thanks everyone!

Content: I had a post on threads, yesterday that has 42k views. It is the 'no idea/new idea post. I almost never encounter much MAGA response. The post got a lot of attacks from them, so I  blocked them. For quite a while it seemed like every block generated a new attack immediately. I always check a profile after I hide the content before blocking it to see if any evidence of persueadability is there. I note that a lot of then are very similar and often have cross conections. Are these bot accounts that are doing this?

Content: I'm calling elected and candidate Democrats who express a desire to have Biden back out. Here's my script. If you don't want to talk with a live person, try calling at night or on the weekend:    I‚Äôm not a constituent, but what you do impacts my life. News reports say that you are asking President Biden to drop out of the race. If that‚Äôs true, I think you should consider that he is probably the best president we‚Äôve had in a generation, in terms of getting things done in spite of a lot of opposition from MAGA Republicans. I think you should also consider that a lot of us voters voted for him in the primary, thinking we actually HAD a vote in a real primary. I know it‚Äôs scary to think Trump might win, and we want to put forward the best candidate possible, but we voters knew that when we voted and we overwhelmingly chose Joe Biden. I really hope you‚Äôll come out in support of the President and put these rumors to rest.

Content: Please also include telling them not to let their negativity bias influence their decisions. They're focusing on Biden's one bad debate while disregarding the 3 1/2 years of good he did for the country. Biden is completely capable of running the country for another 4 years.

Content: We need to help Biden and donate more. I‚Äôm spreading the word for more donations! We also need to target or get more involved in the swing states to make sure Biden wins those swing states.

How can we help to do that? Any ideas? Is Biden planning on campaigning in those swing states like Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania

I saw canvassers being stalked, political tourists running for Sentate, and and so on! We had an opponent in 2022 who was an anti-Semite that was a part of the January 6 riots. WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS CRAP AND WE WILL GET THROUGH IT TOGETHER!

Content: What in the actual heck???!? We need damage control now.  The amount of people saying they're voting for Trump now because we can't get our own party straight is horrifying.  Our own party members saying they're changing to independent after this election.  It's terrifying.  I am terrified right now . So many are.  We need words of encouragement or something right now.  All I can say is this seems like a mistake.  It also seems like it may be a good time to put in Harris Buttigieg however!

I'm watching the BBC News live feed right now and they're saying that he talked to so many people about this. I don't know if it is possible but I will know this is uncharted water to begin with so we'll see.

Content: I have been a Democrat since 1974. This feels like the Donorcratic Party to me now. I am considering going Independent. As an older person, it makes me very angry that his age and one poor debate performance was pounced on, despite his REAL, PROVABLE PERFORMANCE over the past few years. I thought age discrimination was illegal in this country. Apparently not for Presidents or candidates. Of course I will vote for anyone against Trump but I have cancelled all my donation subscriptions and replying STOP to all political text messages. But I can no longer trust myself to convince anyone after watching 14 million primary votes get tossed out so easily by the donor class.

Content: It is illegal, however, it doesn't stop people from doing it. Look, I'm annoyed too but I can understand the reasonings and while you argue donors, you also have to think about the court of public opinion because Trump did gain momentum between the debate debacle, the assassination attempt, and picking a young gun like JD Vance. There are so many factors in play here...and this is coming from someone who is more in the middle when it comes to age.

Content: Hey all -- this afternoon, President Biden decided to not seek reelection and wholeheartedly endorsed Vice President Harris in our effort to beat Donald Trump.

Here are key messages we wanted to share: 

- Vice President Harris has spent the past four years as a governing partner to the most experienced president in American history. She has helped pass and implement historic legislation, and strengthened America‚Äôs national security through her travels to more than 20 countries and meetings with over 150 world leaders.

- Her record as Vice President builds on a distinguished career as District Attorney, Attorney General, and United States Senator from the nation‚Äôs largest state.

- No one is better prepared than Vice President Harris to prosecute the case against Donald Trump. Her work as a prosecutor makes her the ultimate contrast to Trump, the convicted felon.

- Vice President Harris was part of the only ticket to ever beat Trump, earning 81 million votes in 2020 as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate.

We'll have more tomorrow! In the mean time, excited to be here with all of you and doing this important work.

Content: Yes! I move them from my downloads to my desktop first, but that's because some platforms I'm on don't let me move them from downloads directly to a post. When I get my whole post together, with hashtags needed for some DM rooms, I copy the whole post, paste to each platform and load the image or video.

Content: They have the text arcade but also there is a BYOP Texting. They also have ones that are sponsored by partners. I do a lot of the BYOP texting which most people use a service like Google Voice to text with (I highly suggest that).

Content: On the border wall - we have to remember that Trump only succeeded in 52 miles of poorly constructed wall, often just replacing what was there-  ProPublica/Texas Tribune‚ÄùYet an accounting of border wall contracts awarded during his presidency shows that his administration has failed to protect taxpayer interests or contain costs and stifled competition among would-be builders, experts say. In all, Trump‚Äôs wall costs about five times more per mile than fencing built under the Bush and Obama administrations.

Experts say the frequent use of so-called supplemental agreements to add work or increase the price has amounted to giving no-bid contracts to a small group of pre-selected construction firms, many with executives who have donated to Trump or other Republicans.‚Äù And the funds used were from drug enforcement despite the fact that drug trafficking is almost always dine through legal ports of entry.

Content: I want to know who to talk to about the Reach App and its content. I have had trouble in the past because Instagram specifically claims that I have posted false information. In addition, I have noticed that when I create my own content, people respond. When I post the Reach content, there is not much engagement.

Content: I see a lot of sexual stuff about Kamala online. I just ignore it but now I‚Äôm told to hide and block. I try not to block humans that are conversational at all, reasonable 

But even ‚Äúnormies‚Äù that feed at the right wing trough end up sharing nasty memes etc

Content: Yes, the connection is Vance.  Those who are skeptical about its likelihood are ultimately persuadable.  Evidence of Vance's connection is building.

Content: <@1247909990560301182> you asked us to report about online engagement. I posted on Facebook in response to Vance‚Äôs comments earlier this week about childless people not caring about our future. I was especially offended that he included adoptive parent Pete Buttigieg in his list of childless cat ladies and responded from a personal place as an adoptive parent myself. I pointed out that Adoptive parents deliberately choose to take up the responsibility of care for a future generation. But I expanded my comment to a broader point - Americans are generous, and loving, and perpetually optimistic and future oriented. Don‚Äôt try to shrink our national concern down to a craven and egomanical world view. 

I got a lot of positive and vocal engagement from people who were mostly already dems already and happy to comment that they would be out and voting this year, but also from someone I was surprised by. They seemed very connected and enthusiastic about tying democratic platform to real values of caring and optimism.

Content: I'm also a parent through adoption and Vance's cynical and mean comment struck a sour note with me as well. I don't think you need to give birth to a child to care for the next generation. If that were true men wouldn't care about the future at all. There are many ways to make a family. The only important ingredient is love. Step parents are parents. Adoptive parents are parents. Foster parents are parents. Found parents are parents. Raising another couple's children is an act of compassion, love and optimism.

Content: I am so excited for finding this group. I have a team of people on an audio app that work together to counter misinformation and we saw an influx of new users with the announcement of kamala. We are also fighting fake groups on that app pretending to be in support of kamala who fish users and get them into rooms to brainwash them. Any suggestions would be appreciated üòä

Content: Not to be that person, but let's try to be aware of the cultural heritage of Indigenous folks and the term "spirit animal." For those of us without that real background or experience, it's probably more appropriate to say "kindred spirit" or "guide" or "familiar." It's something that I personally have been trying to better myself on. We all can keep learning and that's great. Just wouldn't want to alienate someone from that background when we're all trying to come together for a shared goal.

Content: I point folks to global inflation data. If the problem is everywhere globally then logically it cannot be caused by the US President. You could show them the data which shows that US inflation is actually better than many other places.

if anyone knows how to contact someone who can fix this, the KamalaHQ account hasn't been posting to <#1252676126698897429> for a couple days. I opened a tech support ticket in <#1259167462956597269> but haven't gotten a response in almost two days.

Content: There are a few ways to go around this
1. This is not an easy thing to do. I mean, you can't wave a magic wand and boom, it's gone. There's supply & demand, shrinkflation, etc. Also, I think <@1266177007755198517>raises a great point about how the problem really is global. For instance, I have a friend who moved to Canada because of her job and one day she was doing the conversions and realized that she's paying a lot more in Canada than the US. 
2. Trump did a lot of things that caused a lot of this as we know. Biden inherited a lot of economic mess and it wasn't all because of the pandemic. 

Also, I was asking around and <@1260983976483356767> pointed out to me there's some things in the library on Reach regarding the Inflation Reduction Act which I really suggest everyone taking a look at and sharing with anyone who talks about this because I have heard this complaint from everyone...including my dad who is VERY anti-Trump. The reason why my dad stopped complaining was because one day we were in Walmart and saw several products we buy all the time with lower prices than the last time. Also, I buy a lot in bulk and have been for years but the last time I was in BJ's (it's kinda like Costco which I also frequent), I saw prices on a lot of things being much less than they were a couple weeks ago. We're seeing the impacts of the IRA but it's just taking longer than most people would like.

Content: Serious Question - The NRA. How does one, or can one connect with the spearhead for combating the industry / lobby ... Thanks in advance for some direction.  BTW I spent the past day looking around and find no mention of this particular plank. Appreciate it.

Content: I would think we could always do a comparison/contrast myself. The Reach app has great content regarding gun safety and you might want to point out how a lot of the stuff that we are for, the NRA is fully against.

Content: Honestly, I was thinking there must be many well-meaning firearm enthusiasts (Disenfranchised NRA members / former members) who'd work to form a resistance front. I'd like to know if there's a group organizing for those reasons. Thanks Mary! Tonz.

Content: I've been trying to figure out if there is one to be honest because I also know registered Democrats who are gun owners. I for one am a Democrat and I have a legal carry permit in PA. I support common sense gun laws because I don't want some crackpot getting a gun. Also, there's something rather sus when you look at states like Texas that will restrict everything except how much fire power someone has.

Content: Same here, CCP, Former Reserve Deputy, Public Safety Chaplain, DOC Volunteer - The thought occurs to me that perhaps what I'm imagining is less meaningful to this election cycle, but would be a program that spans years. Like: How to infiltrate, elect and force change from within. I'm a (disenfranchised) Life Member of the NRA and abhore what they've become.

Content: In my opinion nobody is a lost cause. I always try to understand exactly where people are coming from and ask questions. Then I give my perspective on things without judging or directly confronting. You cannot change one's opinion in one conversation, but you can in many, or if you are not going to have multiple conversations, you can always put a question mark, a doubt in their mind which somebody else might expand later on.

Content: That's not ok at all! The c-span link should work for you though. Also - you can restart an account on Reddit any time you want. I've been using the website for 6+ years and I delete, restart accounts all the time. I'm banned from r/convservative (if that helps you feel better).

Content: I do believe they will send you emails on those as well. I know many campaigns do so keep an eye on your email. Also, one thing the party has done in the past and while I don't know if they will do this or not this time is they have also sent text messages if there are events near you.

Content: I want to see good messaging on inflation that makes clear that Trump‚Äôs failed COVID policies caused supply chain problems & incentivized corporate greed artificially raising prices & Biden/Harris have been able to bring them down. Trump‚Äôs plans to shut our borders & raise tariffs will cause massive inflation & only line the pockets of his corporate cronies.

I know one leftist in the UK who convinced her husband who is a US citizen living abroad to go through the process to vote in PA just yesterday because of the switch.

Content: Feedback for mods from a Texas supporter: I love Kamala and she has my vote, but she desperately needs to put up a better website. I wish there was a better hub for her positions and views. A website I can read for talking points and statistics. Every website I navigate to only provides links for donations including KamalaHarris.com. I promise I am already donating.

Content: Being from PA, I would like Shapiro but I'm worried about the amount of attack ads calling him "Genocide Josh" since he's Jewish and recent claims that someone in his campaign had a sexual harassment claim against him. I think the GOP is most afraid of him so they're preemptively gearing up a smear campaign

Content: I often turn to dictionary definitions or functions. I would proceed like this, ‚ÄúProsecutors are responsible for prosecuting offenses that violate either state or federal laws that either a state general assembly or congress have enacted. Can you help me understand what part of that is problematic or off putting?‚Äù Of course, that is assuming it is a honest, open, and civil exchange.

Content: You can open this question right here in this channel. We want to hear about your conversations so that we better understand how they are going and what challenges you face. Maybe you can give more details why Kamala's prosecutor background could be seen as a negative thing. 
The other day I heard a political commentator saying this makes her more popular with suburban voters.

Content: Thanks for sharing your views.  It's helpful to get this feedback on the conversations that you have in your community. That's what the Online Engagement is about. Obviously, I cannot speak for the campaign, but we can highlight this so that the staffers can share more details on those topics.

Content: I did phone banking in PA today and it was crazy positive. Lots of hype for VP Harris in unexpected red, senior communities. People just want to see more from Kamala--lot of questions about when she gets interviews, town halls, debates. It feels like the key issue in PA is turnout rather than convincing of any policy issue

Content: As a PA native, I think this is a statewide issue, but we can never get anyone's names or pronunciations correct. Lots of people told me they were excited for "Ka-mala," and someone else told me they hoped that "nice Mr. Beshie from Delaware" got VP lol

Content: One of the reasons I want to vote for Kamala is that she does show empathy for the Palestinian people. A ceasefire is very important to me, as I value human rights and safety for all people (freedom from fear). There‚Äôs a delicate balancing act that Kamala needs to pull off, and I felt like her comments after her meeting with Netanyahu were nuanced and spot-on. I hope that she‚Äôll continue to emphasize the human rights of BOTH Israelis and Palestinians. I‚Äôm an independent voter who was undecided before she joined the race. So the undecided voters are not a monolith in terms of their views. Everyone I know, Democrat or undecided, has responded positively so far to her comments on Gaza. There are also folks who appreciate a nuanced approach.

Content: I hope you're right! I've been really impressed by how careful and nuanced her messaging has been so far, but the balancing act may be her biggest hurdle. It's a little disheartening to see the GOP sowing misinformation about a potential Shapiro VP pick and setting up "Genocide Josh" to capitalize on discontentment

Content: Here‚Äôs a question for the online engagement volunteers or mods: 

When a graphic displays a website, do we think adding a QR code is helpful or not?  The downside is they can draw attention and clutter up a design and we wouldn‚Äôt want to do that if people think they aren‚Äôt helpful.

Content: Graphic designer here - I personally don't see QR codes on websites as being very effective. If the person is viewing on a desktop and takes out their phone and scans the code they've moved from the desktop to their phone. I think its more effective just to put a link to where you want them to go instead of a QR code. I typically only use QRs in print media and physicial signage. Hope that helps!

Content: I'm not sure if this is the right channel, but if not, do we have subchannels with shareable graphics, videos by policy type? I'm seeing a lot of us getting questions on Palestine and immigration for example, and having the info in one place might be helpful

Content: Thank you, but unfortunately I tried looking up the issue in the app prior to commenting here. While searching for Harris specifically, Border/immigration isn't a filterable category. Searching for border produces 2 videos, and immigration only 1 (which was included in the border search results). Israel/Palestine isn't a drop down either. Searching for both individually produces the same video included in the border search results

Content: I know we have to wait until the new policy is ratified at the convention, but since it sounds like these are two common areas I was hoping someone might have somehting more streamlined rather than doing independent research if the DNC is not able to produce anything official for the time being

Content: 99 more days to election and 99 more chances to show our neighbors that Biden didn't just pass the torch to Harris but to all of us. This is a people-powered campaign fighting to protect our freedom, and I would love to see some poignant graphic design depicting that to share. Anyone have any suggestions?

Content: Reach just suggested we post a video of Trump stating all legal scholars demanded roe v wade be overturned with no statement that that was a complete lie. Seriously, if we want to lose this election, not calling trump on his lies is a good way to do it. This is what you want us to post???

 ‚ÄúI was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal scholars, both sides, wanted and, in fact, demanded be ended: Roe v. Wade. They wanted it ended.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm not posting that until it states that that was a complete fabrication. Do better, people!

They do not know how to take action and feel like they are overreacting to cut family off over it but .. they want to.

Content: Young ppl don't care about hashtags they want influencers they like to endorse if that makes sense. If you use hashtags to get seen by young ppl in spaces that aren't political they get annoyed. You can create a call to action hashtag like get active or go vote with a year attached. Grassroots hashtags will be most successful for Gen z that don't feel apart of much. Ex: local trash clean up hashtags or subreddits for cleaning and use your host training to organize (something I'm working on today)

Content: I wouldn't put that past them at this point.  I don't like to put on tin foil hats.  But Zuck did say he thought Trump "looked cool" last week.  Just in case though, I dusted off my mastodon account.

Content: I was expecting this. This is why I suggest everyone to use every single social media account at their disposal. It also helps in the sense that while people are still using platforms like X/Twitter (whatever it's called now) & Facebook, there are others that are using smaller ones like Mastradon and BlueSky as well.

Content: No problem. I've been doing this kind of work since Phil Murphy's re-election in NJ and I learned a bit about how wording a hashtag a certain way attracts certain audiences thanks to a digital media organizer I worked with on John Fetterman's campaign.

Content: I'm actually starting to draft a bill suggestion i'm planning on sending to my representative Melanie Stansbury.  microblogging is an important way for our government to communicate with the public.  Especially during disasters.  What scares me is the thought of a company getting bought up or going out of business when our leaders need to reach us.  So I want her to suggest requring all government agencies and representatives to exclusively use open source platforms like mastodon that don't rely on a company.  The US can afford to run it's own mastodon servers (and does already in a lot of education settings).  That way we never have to worry about any of those nightmare scenarios.

Content: Since I'm talking about OSS, you might also tell them to read the licenses. The GPL wants to be the "de facto" standard but it has a ton of gotcha clauses to prevent any source code at all from being hidden away or proprietary. That might not be completely possible in a gov scenario.

Content: After its President [praised Trump's VP at his RNCC speech](https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/07/16/teamsters-chief-praises-jd-vance-among-other-gop-lawmakers-at-convention/ ), the Teamsters [were considering not endorsing](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/blow-biden-teamsters-consider-no-endorsement-2024-race-2024-07-15/ ).  But he has/will interview both nominees for a potential endorsement.

Biden has protected the pensions of over 1 million union workers and retirees from cuts.  In several swing states, he has protected: 40,000 Teamsters in Ohio and Michigan; more than 30,000 in Illinois and Missouri; and more than 20,000 in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania.

Content: Love that, too! I tried the combination of PB and Nutella just a couple of months ago for the first time. I want more of it. If it's the only meal that is left, then I'll have two jumbo glasses of that. (The last meal should have some calories, right?)

Content: Thanks to all who responded to me yesterday about QR codes.That was really helpful. 

I‚Äôm one of the creators in the volunteer content brigade and I have another question for all the Online Engagement folks. We have occasionally gotten some feedback as to what subjects you‚Äôd like us to cover (Project 2025, Kamala‚Äôs accomplishments etc.)  But what we haven‚Äôt heard is how you‚Äôre feeling about the content we are making.

** Is there any feedback you can share about what things ‚Äì or even types of things ‚Äì your people are responding/engaging to? **

For instance:
‚Äì are comparison graphics between the candidates helpful? 
‚Äì or infographics?
‚Äì snarky jabs at Trump/Vance/GOP?
‚Äì graphics featuring quotes (either negative or positive)?
‚Äì memes?
‚Äì positive photos, slogans of Kamala
- negative videos of Trump/Vance/GOP
‚Äì positive videos of Kamala

- Has anything really clicked with your circle that surprised you? Or has nothing? And how are the volunteer-made things comparing to other things you find online and share? Is there anything others are doing that you would like our team to lean into more? 

And lastly, a question for the leads. <@1256039311367999658> <@941196169852366859> <@1054909991468929104> <@1184187512491618404> <@1263196733790224597> <@1247909990560301182> <@1248274609086660722> 
 I know views and shares are a very inexact science, but Reach and Sosha and Discord all have analytics and ways of getting feedback from volunteers. Do we have any data on what we think might be working well and working less well at this point? 

Thanks very much in advance for your honest and constructive feedback. We have lots of wonderful volunteers creating lots of different things ‚Äî which we will all continue to do. But personally, I think it would be great to hear how it all might be playing ‚Äî or *not * playing ‚Äî out in the wild and how we can better help you engage!

Content: I don't understand what the expectation is here at Discord. I volunteered to take specific actions. I am working during the day and do not have time to search through these channels to find why I'm getting notified as if I have a DM. Can we please have an action-only type of channel. I'm sorry, but my time is very limited and I need this process streamlined, please.

Content: What really resonates in my communities: GOOD NEWS (about the economy, jobs, border crossings, crime, etc.) with the data that supports it. Presented in easy-to-read format. Bulleted lists. Things that people can easily digest and then copy to share in their own networks.

Content: You can also mute the chatty channels.  On mobile you long click the channel name and there is a mute option.

The announcements pages will really have all you need for specific actions requested as far as I can tell.

Content: Would love more infographics on Harris and positive record / outcomes as VP and in previous positions. 

Separate question: I‚Äôm in NC and wondering if there is a content creation group similar to this for our governor‚Äôs race? We desperately need it!

Content: Hi! Reach will always be the go-to place for content that comes from the campaign. We also have supporter created content here in Discord.

Discord is mostly for community building, asking questions, etc!

Content: Suggestion for the Reach library - add State labels.  There is state-specific content under Economy, Infrastructure, etc.  It would be handy to have compiled by state for easy sharing to friends in those states.

Content: <@577210116668129281> I really like the positive infographics that emphasize what VP Harris has done with impactful visuals like the postpartum maternal care comparison maps.

I also would like one that emphasizes her tie-breaking votes on the big issues to show how she's been working as hard as Vance, if not harder, while Trump's been golfing.

Content: I see very little mention of Christian Nationalism on here...and I searched. I'd like to recommend James Talarico's sermon on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blph_2RSBno (as well as his sermon on Separation of Church and State: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E5jjHW6ncc)

We could build a toolkit out of those two presentations alone. Christian Nationalists are not Christian.

Keep the control initiatives, *develop the image* that the party IS NOT anti-2A.

I'm totally happy to do that. I'd also be happy to join the content creators team. I'm just older and not super savvy with the tools.

Content: That's why they focus on the Get To 270 strategies, focusing on the states we need to get the electoral votes. Democrats have won all the popular votes in, I don't know, some big number of past presidential elections, so this isn't just a Hillary phenom.

Content: After engaging with some followers on FB, there's request for more clear information on where VP Harris stands on specific issues. Sharing this for feedback but hopefully this information is already in the works for the website or Reach graphics! 

- CapGains taxes: Biden tried to increase them by over 80%, from 25% to 46%
- policy on Israel
- Policy on Iran, China and Russia
- position on managing US‚Äôs budget and debt

Content: The Biden policy on Cap Gains I know (since I pay Cap Gains and depend on income from investments) were not going to increase for anyone who didn't make over $1M per year. It would affect very few of us normal people. I also had a phone bank call where they asked about Cap Gains. It's just a scare tactic w/ inaccurate info. Those who make over $1M/yr have tax experts who help them get deductions to minimize all these taxes, which change all the time.

Content: I am having trouble connecting today to calls but I noticed on The David Parkman show (YouTube).. a debate about Kamala Harris or Donald Trump for president.. with, I think, a centrist and a conservative!

- They claim Dems want to keep the boarder open by not closing it, by controlling it instead. This seems to be the only talking point that can be policy related so far, to me.
- Trying to redefine a "sanctuary city" > conservatives would like to see only legal immigration processes and don't want their language policed when describing their issues i think ?
- They separate the think tank for P2025 from trump and claim there are liberal think tanks, too.. but i don't see a manifesto for Democrats ? ü•≤
- Conservatives seem mad they don't have more involvement in their schools oversight of their kids pronouns, they said it gets drowned out by the insurrection

Content: On getting more engaged with faith communities, there is a program called Labor in the Pulpits which is done in congregations on Labor Day.  It usually has a person from Labor delivering a message.  In PA, that message might be about sustainable energy and increasing the union labor force to make that a possible.  This could be tied to voter registration and identifying voters for the Harris campaign.

Content: Yes thanks for the offer. I have looked through Reach and that‚Äôs why I said there is not much or nothing.  To win voters in the 60+ group you have to address those issues of income security.

Content: I'm starting to notice a pattern in comments across diff platforms. The commenter writes: "I'm from <another country>. I'm worried about <the latest conspiracy theory meant to sow fear and get us to obey in advance>. Can you please explain how this could work?" This starts a whole worry cycle among the posters. One little comment and mission accomplished. We really need to be vigilant and keep our eyes on the prize. Anything that deflects from Trump's overt racism, extremism, and weirdness helps him and hurts us. If anyone has other tips for spotting a bot or paid actor please let us know!

Content: In thinking about online engagement we need more stuff in Spanish. If we are going to get the Hispanic/Latino Community to vote for Harris especially Latino Men we need to reach them. The Hispanic/Latino Community is not a monolith. Immigration cannot be the only focus since Puerto Ricans are US citizens and the issues Puerto Ricans face are different.

Content: There is much online to counter his claim. For example, here is what's in an article from NBC: Project 2025 "is backed by over 100 conservative organizations, many led by close allies of Trump, including Turning Point USA, the Center for Renewing America, the Claremont Institute, the Family Policy Alliance, the Family Research Council, Moms for Liberty and America First Legal ‚Äî the latter of which is led by Stephen Miller, a top former Trump adviser.

Former Trump administration officials who have been directly affiliated with Project 2025 include former Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, former deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn and former Justice Department senior counsel Gene Hamilton.

Vought, one of the key authors of Project 2025, is also the Republican National Committee‚Äôs platform policy director."

Content: Yeah just because he SAYS anything doesn't mean he is telling the truth. He lies so much and threatens others when lying... it is a pattern. Ppl think donating to a democratic campaign somehow means he didn't donate somewhere else? No real counter arguments... interesting.

Content: Lootboxes have some serious means of harming people vulnerable to that type of gamification.  On top of that, there was nothing holding many gaming companies accountable for the way they presented loot boxes.  Oftentimes, they would present the box as having a "chance" to win a high-value item, but in reality, you'd have to spend hundreds of dollars to pull the high-value item LAST out of the box, which shouldn't be the case if there were actual chances to win, as implied.

Content: I did not realize the financial strain it takes. So the gambling addiction side could be very serious in video games.

Would this become something like slot machines since it's compared so often?..

Content: I feel good making a difference everyday instead of yelling at my TV üì∫.   I also wanted to remind everyone that each text or call is important as we continue to sharpen our database and information so when we GOTV we will have eliminated a lot of the angry Republican wrong #'s etc.

Content: I'm going to give you a visual since this may be easier. On the left hand side of Discord in your browser, will be all the servers that you are a part of (the sidebar in the box). Click one and you'll be on that server and when you want to switch around, this is where you go.

Content: This campaign is really energizing me! We have something to fight for, as well as something to fight against. Any creative graphic creator out there who can depict this to share on social media? Or is there something available already? Example of fight for message-- Vote  Harris, Vote  Freedom. Vote American.  Example of a graphic depicting fighting against: Weirdo, Creepo, Psycho (a picture of Trump, Vance, Hannibal Lecter)

Content: I know Chistian mentioned the supporter content channel. We also will have things though Reach so also keep your eye out there as well. If you use the mobile apps, you can set notifications for both Discord and Reach for new content. Also, SoSha is our newest tool in the arsenal so check out that as well.

Harris supports better security at the border.  Trump is blocking it.‚Ä¨‚Äù

Content: I'm getting total dejavu here. Here's why: I was a field & distributed organizing volunteer leader with PA Dems in 2022 and that year in the governor's race, the GOP nominee, Doug Mastraino had ties to a social media platform called Gab which was not only far right but it was also anti-Semitic. That last one was a huge talking point because the Democratic nominee--and now PA's current governor--Josh Shapiro is Jewish. Oh man...the GOP never learns, do they?

Content: The same when I was in Spain. I was living in Gandia when refugees were stranded in a ship. Our city took in an amount that community groups could support. They were welcomed at the Town Hall and given Spanish lessons. Those that were able were given jobs in the city or community to offset their cost of housing and utilities. They were put on the social healthcare system and given vouchers for food and personal items. This helped the local economy as well. The Mayor and city council decided how many immigrants were allowed in the city. I had to register at the City Hall and the police department to stay past my 3 months and apply to the province capital for residency.

Content: Something I recently posted in light of Trump trying to make it appear he's not part of or supporting project 2025. 

Don't fall for the PR stunt.  Project 2025 is the playbook for a Trump presidency organized by The Heritage Foundation.

In 2022, speaking at their annual leadership conference, Trump actually said, ‚ÄúThis is a great group, and they‚Äôre going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do‚Ä¶And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

Why else would he tell Christian extremists you won't have to vote anymore after 2025 if you elect him? 

Whose staffers are all part of project 2025? Trump's.  

Whose appointees are part of it? Trump's.  

Whose supreme Court appointees are part of it? 
Trump's.

Who works in the background as donors and funders of Trump? The federalist society and Project 2025.

Content: Hey everyone! I wasn't sure where else to put this, but this could be big, and maybe something that we should keep in our back pockets as the Trump campaign tries to distance itself from Project 2025. 

JD Vance is literally the face of conventionofstates.com right now. If you don't know what it is, it is Project 2025 without going the whole "executive branch takeover" route. Article V of the Constitution includes two routes for amending itself. This is the option that we have never used. They want the same thing as Project 2025. They even said so here in an archived blog post: https://web.archive.org/web/20240802175038/https://conventionofstates.com/news/what-is-project-2025-a-plot-to-destroy-america-or-a-playbook-to-dismantle-the-ruling-class

I archived that link in case they scrub the blog post from their site.

I think it is important to get some eyes on this. Bringing light to Project 2025 has severely damaged the Trump campaign. If Convention of States gets the same attention, AND Mr. Vance is proudly the face of it, perhaps this could energize more democracy enthusiasts like myself : )

After all, the distance between Trump and Vance will be a heartbeat if they somehow win. Again, sorry if this isn't the right place. I wasn't sure where else to get the word out. 

Archived link with JD Vance as the face of Convention of States' website in case they scrub it: https://web.archive.org/web/20240801031329/https://conventionofstates.com/

Content: Some of the stuff being posted to <#1250876565366243348> looks like the general low effort stuff that gets posted to the Twitter/X comments sections. We should be careful with those kinds of memes as they usually only feed the trolls and incite people in general.

Content: The ‚ÄúBlue Wall‚Äù polls are all now within the margin of error. The momentum is with Kamala and Trump is flailing. There are lots of reasons for optimism. But with three months to go, this is far, far from won.
 
So we need to keep reminding voters who Trump is. And no one has more credibility doing that than the unprecedented number of people he invited into his Administration who left sounding the alarm.
 
Like British-born Fiona Hill, the leading Russia expert on Trump‚Äôs National Security Council. Hill witnessed first-hand Trump‚Äôs fawning, creepy admiration for all-powerful autocrats like Putin, Kim, and Orban.  She warns ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in a very dangerous moment‚Äù and that a second Trump term "is ‚Äúa path toward authoritarianism and autocracy."
 
See for yourself here . It‚Äôs just 50 seconds. Please consider sharing this with family, friends, colleagues and neighbors.
 
Also, please Like and Share over social media platforms as well.
 
Thanks so much for your continuing support for this effort.

If you were able to add someone to Mount Rushmore, who would it be?

I'm part Native American so I'm not really 100% crazy about Mount Rushmore to begin with but if I had to, I'd have to give a shout out to two of the greatest Native American Democrats to serve this country in the political world: Sharice Davids & Deb Haaland.

Content: Hi all, just FYI, if you haven't seen it yet, we've opened a new channel for posting news cycle links, discussing detailed topics (like VP preferences), and other non-Harris campaign items.  <#1268426751164551199>. This is to keep <#1242249109298221069> more of a lighthearted lobby about the Harris campaign w/ server and action guidance as needed. 

Thank you!

Content: Where can we find fact sheets contrasting what Harris Biden has done for us or will do versus what Trump has done?  I get attacked from family members online every time I post a pro Harris or pro Dem post.  I could google talking points but wanted to know if there is something more handy.

Content: "She was always of Indian heritage, & she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was #Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black," #Trump said, adding: "She made a turn, & she became a Black person, & I think somebody should look into that."

As #unhinged as this sounds - & is - Team Trump believes this is a politically smart message.

Content: I'm planning to read through the Project 2025, the RNC platform, and the DNC platform when it is released to create posts like the one below.

In short, I want to pull factual info/quotes from the documents to compare and contrast. Then attach screen shots of the relevant language from the documents.

Does anything like this already exists? A lot of what I'm seeing in the Reach App are general, very broad, statements.

(This is a screenshot from my Facebook page, the individual documents are fully visible there)

Content: No, there are orgs that focus on Project 2025.  But I'm not aware of comparisons.  By the way, Trump has videos for his Agenda 47.

Content: Hi Deb. Thanks for being here with us. It looks like the staff has made that action card expire for us in the monthly points contest. HOWEVER, the video might still be available to you in the LIBRARY section of Reach. Look for that button next to the ACTION feed, then select see all RECENT CONTENT. (The videos have their length in the bottom right corner.) Perhaps it is there now? Or in one of the Galleries already? Thanks again. (In general, action items are moved to the COMPLETED section once you've marked them done. So sometimes you just need to click on the COMPLETED button to see them. Again, this one expired so you probably won't see it.)

Content: Hi! Should have posted this earlier (and I apologize if not allowed, I'm still new here and learning my way around), but there has been a #Caturday social media takeover I've been taking part in today. I got the info from the Cats and Dogs Unite for Harris call the other day. They have a website where you can share various images and videos they have up, all with text and tags to go along with them pertaining to Caturday. It's pretty great! Join us if you like! https://app.sosha.ai/toolkit/70d44902-cafa-4459-9df5-6da17ea6f54b

Content: Can we get a graphic contrasting evolution vs. re-run Donald? And maybe a couple just on Donald being like watching re-runs that jumped the shark? This is what his rallies have become, and it's the kind of thing that gets under his skin. Thanks for everyone's work!

Content: I have been looking for a side-by-side comparison of Harris Vs Trump to use with anyone on the fence, but I'm not sure about using this one.  It doesn't feel like an apples-to-apples approach in how they compare the two on some of the issues-- look at "immigration," for example, where on Trump "side" it is just a quote from his website that begins with "Trump promises a crackdown on migration. His campaign website says: "President Trump will shut down Biden's border disaster...."    And there is no reference to the disastrous family separations policy that were in place when he was in office, and no reference to his recently killing the bipartisan immigration bill so he could continue to blame Biden for issues at the border:  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/immoral-republicans-rebuke-efforts-kill-immigration-deal-help-trump-rcna135732

Content: Although my conversations are online they are with people I have relationships with. My focus has been to ask for specific Trump policies while sharing Harris proposals. It is at least clear to me who is more interested in helping the most Americans. I've made some headway with this approach but... Still fighting the good fight.

Content: I've been trying to engage disenfranchised Republicans who definitely don't want to vote for Trump, but aren't sure about Harris. My approach with them is not to bash Trump (since they already don't like him) but try to find areas of shared values and interest that a Harris presidency could bring.

Content: Misinformation: This isn't that big a deal as he did have a decent crowd and the fight is real for voter turnout, but I saw a lot of online chatter about the Trump Atlanta rally crowd and much disinformation. So I found a YouTube channel that was showing the rally (on live stream loop, and still is) and the video has a section where they scanned the entire stadium and there really were so many empty seats. I don't know if it's AI some of the right's videos are posting but they're claiming the seats were only empty before Trump came on but that is not true and can be viewed here, if you have any friends/family who trust you enough to watch it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5QW-WxscqE (can scrub through video to see the empty stands while Trump is talking). edit to add: Trump even talks about all the empty seats and blames the university staff.

Content: It's hard to say what's been most effective, but one thing I know is that when I bring up the 60+ election interference lawsuits lost by the GOP after 2020, they go radio silent. Helps to mention that most of the judges were GOP appointees, including some Trump appointees, and that several judges admonished the plaintiffs for wasting the court's time.

(Of course, this only works when people bring up the topic.)

Content: The problem w/ these side by side posts is MAGA is replying that these aren't taken at the same time during the rally and the Trump clip is "before he came on". It's hard to tell if that that's true or not. So the link I sent is unequivocal evidence of empty seats, which Trump acknowledges in his rambling, incoherent, long, boring, selfish, weird speech. So it can be a response to those commenters to send that link (and can share with a timestamp so it starts right where he's speaking then swings to show all the empty seats).

‚Ä¢ Crime and murder rates are way down
‚Ä¢ Gas prices are down
‚Ä¢ The flow to the border is down
‚Ä¢ We‚Äôve had the strongest economic recovery of any advanced economy in the world and the best job market since the 1960s
‚Ä¢ We have the lowest uninsured rate in American history
‚Ä¢ The deficit is trillions less
‚Ä¢ The Dow has broken 40,000 and all three indices continue to hover in record territory
‚Ä¢ Domestic oil, gas and renewable production continue to be at all-time highs, leaving America more energy independent than it has been in decades.

Content: My two biggest strategies have been showing people Trump and Vance‚Äôs own words with almost very little context, the message is so crystal clear it‚Äôs almost too hard to miss, while contrasting that with Harris‚Äô message of freedom. It‚Äôs like night and day. Shining that light on how different our campaigns are can be helpful. I also have a tough crowd, my groups and friends/family are either conservatives or Bernie-left wing‚Ä¶

Content: Makes sense. In his endorsement of Biden, he begins by addressing a few things he "strongly disagrees" with. Then, he went on to discuss the many accomplishments and points in common. It was beautifully done, IMHO, and showed how we can disagree on some issues but still come together for the greater good.

Content: Alright. Here's what I got. There in all likelihood won't be a recording as there will be a lot of focus on listening and answering specific questions and less talking points. The official Harris Campaign YouTube channel will have loads of really good content if you're looking for specific videos and recordings, though. Probably not the answer you were looking for, but I hope this helps.

Content: My 30 yr old son has been on the fence because of money issues. He has a FT job, makes decent $, but doesn‚Äôt think he will ever be able to own a home. The cost of living is a huge issue for him & many others (including me). Thankfully, I think I have him swayed, just by showing him the daily Trump meltdowns. I feel like we need more concise policy talking points to reach out to undecided voters. Just my 2. No disrespect, just feel like honest feedback is how we are gonna get this across the finish line!

Content: The "money issue" is a big one for seniors, too, and that's my target audience. Our concerns are basic. Food, shelter, transportation, and healthcare. We already did or did not own a home. Already did or did not go to college. Those are issues that young people are rightfully concerned about.

Content: so my father, who was pretty high up in the corporate ladder b4 he retired, always says that the stock market hates political instability, and Trump is not stable. When the stock market is panicky, people get laid off. The general recklessness that Trump brings to office is precisely the thing that will destroy middle class jobs.

Content: OOOh fair point - I think many would have no problem with going back to the Gilded age of robber barons and 16 hour workdays. But a lot of head honchos in the business world have come out for Harris. They prefer stability. Trump was very reckless with business regulations and it caused a lot of upheaval. Also the threat of political upheaval makes CEOs very anxious, and when they are anxious, they curtail growth, and cut costs. They infinitely prefer gentle political turnover and changes that occur through the political system, because that often increases rights and that opens up more revenue streams. So if he's worried about layoffs/lack of career growth, he should avoid reckless candidates.

Content: Here's another great data point: Since 1989 and a new age of globalization began, 52 million jobs have been created in America. 50m of those, 96%, have been created under Democratic Presidents. Essentially all of them, over 36 years. (Most of what I'm been sharing here today is from Simon Rosenberg's blog. He's got all the data!)

Content: My messaging that has been the most effective has been to tell my story. The reason I support Kamala is to restore reproductive rights. I suffered a miscarriage years ago but thankfully Drs were able to save me from dying. Today in Texas, Drs are afraid of going to jail for the same.

Content: I am still trying to figure out the most effective way to message to the vast diversity of my state. It seems as if I must first pop the disinformation bubble that has held my state prisoner for the last 8 years. I am on my own which makes it even more challenging. Even when I share stories or information I know to be accurate (meidas mighty here) I am getting extreme push back. So....I am trying a variety of new things to see what may be more effective. I am always hopeful that the people in my own community will one day snap out of this delusional. I have tried stories of women. I was called a liar. I have tried videos of Trump and Vance saying it outloud  - same result. I have tried news articles. Same push back. Yesterday, I left a message in the group. It was very vague. It helps me to determine who is who in the community. I let them tell everyone exactly who they are - so....next step. Block bots, report threats, find my people, and move forward.

Content: Most effective messaging for me has been contrasting Dem positions giving freedom and options to GOP policy positions esp from Project2025 that force the government‚Äôs will upon an individual.    Just framing it that way seems to help.
Any time I bring up any fact from P2025 it gets people thinking. I tailor the fact to the person I‚Äôm speaking with. And I always frame
it as freedom vs government restriction of rights.

Content: If you find a way, let me know. I just had to block my own half-brother on Facebook because he was accusing me of "playing from the DNC Uno deck." He also disrespected my boundaries a lot and when I told him that even my friends who support Trump have DMed me about how they're fed up with his garbage, he laughed in my face.

Content: Okay, I'm going to pull out an old trick from my days as a field volunteer leader and see if I can answer this. The best way to do this is to simply see what issues matter to them. Engage in a conversation with them and then you provide the facts.

For instance: let's say your friend talks about infrastructure. They say about how they're afraid of a bridge collapse or if they take mass transit, issues with mass transit.

What you can do at first is connect with them and be like, "Hey, I get it. I was on the train heading home and I felt like this thing was going to fall apart (or there were delays not to be believed)." or you can say how you are concerned because of recent bridge collapses that caused traffic jams (we had this happen with a part of I-95 in the Philadelphia area).

Next is to tell them how the Democrats have combat this. You can talk about how the Biden administration has pumped billions into improving our bridges and mass transit. For instance, here in PA where I live, that part of I-95 that collapsed was repaired very quickly and the mass transit system, SEPTA was able to accommodate the overflow to the point where they worked with other nearby systems to borrow extra trains to ease congestion on the rails. There was also an announcement in the Philadelphia area that SEPTA is planning to improve the cars on their subway lines and also, Amtrak itself has had massive improvements to their stations, trains, and lines.

Basically you're connecting with the voter and providing information and trust me, it does work. For instance in 2022, I canvassed in the town I live in and this one lady said about gas prices which were close to $4 a gallon at the time in some places. I could relate because I have a (small) SUV and I told her how John Fetterman wasn't going to pander to big oil. It won her on voting Dem. 

Hope this helps.

Content: I have these people in my life. I have been this person myself. I don't mean to sound harsh, but are they voting in a swing state? If not, it may not be worth your time to try to persuade them. I was VERY confident in my ignorance back then... and of course, I had the comfort of knowing my protest vote wouldn't affect the electors from my state.

Content: I remind them sometimes the 3rd party candidates are not on the ballot in every state, like this year, it is statistical impossible they win. A vote this year for 3rd party candidate is a vote for Trump, all are the same side of Project 2025. It's my 2 cents.

Content: I think it's very important that we not get wrapped around the axel to try to persuade those who don't wanna be persuaded. Time and people are the resources we cannot replace. Spend your time telling your story and what it means to you in a truthful, authentic way. Those aspects matter more than any facts (if it were truly about facts, then we wouldn't really be where we are, would we?)

Content: Tiktok and CapCut make it possible for creators can add captions and translations manually (instead of auto-generated translation). A creator can write whatever they want in that space. Unfortunately it can be used to boost algorithm and search.

Content: Do you mean the Republican activist? https://apnews.com/article/trump-chick-fil-a-black-voters-d981e8edac067fa8912cc56c92d8b9ab. Although from the looks from those comments, I think she's already gotten a lot of negative attention - she's young and I'd hate to see her get harassed - I mean this sincerely! - I don't think she needs to be called out much more than this.

I'm trying to compare and contrast the Dems to the RNC  platform and Project 2025.

I'm looking for a better way to format the screenshots. Is there an app for that?  My goal is to include screenshots of the relevant documents to prove accuracy of the comparison.

Content: - the VP's platform always adheres to the president's platform, not vice-versa. If she says she's anti-ketchup-on-hotdogs, and pro-hot-peppers-on-Italian-beef-sandwiches, the VP candidate takes up that platform.

Content: I think <@260982275506700288> may have been thinking more about smears and rumors about their identity or past, rather than their platform. For example in one of the calls I made today on a phonebank, the voter was concerned for increased scrutiny and attacks on the LGBTQIA+ community if Pete Buttigieg was picked. Another example, Kamala's husband was forced to acknowledge an affair in a previous marriage. The right will attack anything, especially if it distracts from the issues.

Content: Okay, this is bizarre but I think I have an explanation.  So, believe it or not, "Kamala" translates in Finnish as "horrible."  So when the text was one word only, TikTok's auto translator didn't recognize her first name as a proper name, guessed the language to translate that one word was in Finnish and bingo!   I suppose the exclamation mark made it even more likely to mis-translate this in the computer. 

So I imagine it's not malicious or an error on our part.  It shouldn't happen with any sentence that isn't the one word "Kamala."  And I'd also imagine that auto-translators should start recognizing her first name as a proper name soon.

Content: Yes thank you for making that more clear. The stuff I‚Äôm seeing online pushes a lot of contextless and sometimes just totally fabricated information on the possible picks.

I think some resources to counteract these inevitable smear campaigns or lies could be helpful for a more rapid response online in the early days of the VP pick.

Content: <@492419525099126806> it's super vague but seems to specify abortion and contraceptives. 

Here's one on contraception: https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025-would-take-away-access-to-free-emergency-contraception-for-48-million-women/

and one on abortion:

Content: What would you tell Dems after the VP pick to ensure there is continued enthusiasm and unity, even if someone doesn‚Äôt get the VP pick they were hoping for?

I am sure there will be some negativity online regardless of choice. We should look to messaging that can diffuse that reaction

That's what it's all about, my friend -human connection and being present for one another. <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>  Scroll up on this channel and you'll see the "Drop the Hat(e)" meme posted this morning. I think you'll really like it.

After listening to my communities I discovered I need to take some more classes on disinformation, so signed up for more classes. Have been pushing out stuff from Reach to state FB groups and other social media sites. Just trying to figure out who likes what and where.

Content: Big Midwest Dad energy and an Indigenous woman will take his Governor seat. I thought all of the possibles were great choices but stoked about this one. It‚Äôs also a confident choice‚Äîif she were just looking at numbers it would have been Shapiro

Content: I really like Walz. He's done so much for Michigan. All children have free breakfast and lunch. They do lunches during the summer. He's done a lot for education (he's a former teacher). He's done paid family and medical leave. If you get a driver's license you are automatically enrolled to vote. He's a great pick.

Content: I‚Äôm praying this was a taken down of CNN to prove they are crap news now They ruined her moment! This was her moment to have and it‚Äôs tainted now. A progressive ticket is t big dad energy from Minnesota in my opinion but it is Kamala‚Äôs decision and I will support her to the end. However, it was a miss to make history with Pete IF the rumor is true. I‚Äôm not gonna feel anything until Kamala tells us who she picked. Socials are being insane right now and I‚Äôm waiting before I decide if I‚Äôm getting my life back some or if I stay in 24/7

Content: I think we all are. There doesn't seem to be a mechanism to say, "Ok this person is donating enough, let's leave them alone" üòÖ 
I've started reframing the texts and e-mails in my mind as the campaign keeping me updated with their messaging and outreach strategy. I'm already giving and volunteering as much as I can so they're not really asking ME.  I get it though, there sure are a lot of them.

Content: This is a good strategy! There was actually one solicitation that had a box to check saying ‚Äúalready donated‚Äù it should not be too hard to add that box to all solicitations and maybe they will if they get the feedback. I know they are in a scramble, so I don‚Äôt worry too much about it. I have $25 monthly going in and then I am choosing strategic times to donate a little more. ‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt think anyone wants folks to do more than they can and if you have donated once, you can contribute in other ways. I ordered the free postcards to send out. üôèüèº
Thank you to all of us doing whatever we can and if the most we can manage is our vote, that really matters!!!

Content: Hi Delois, I appreciate being new here is challenging and may not be the right path for you. You can continue to engage with the campaign directly on Reach which is pretty easy, it allows you to choose content and then automatically shares it with your social platforms.

Content: Really want to give a shout to the people running the online engagement trainings. They're great. I went to parts 1 and 2. The best tip is that when people react negatively to a post, even when it's just something like sharing where Kamala and Tim stand on issues, it's better to just not engage. Move on and do the most good you can with others. My instinct sometimes is to engage to understand where the person is coming from. With only 90 days to go, we have to be focused on undecideds, not those who would never vote for this ticket. That really helped me, especially yesterday, when I posted about Tim adopting rescue pets. Most people were lovely and it got so much engagement. And there were a few who were just hateful. I just muted the hateful ones and it was absolutely the right thing to do. ü´∂

Content: I know some swing voters who would respond to this message. They are pro-business and worried that raising corporate taxes will hurt the economy.  So, anything I can show them that counters that and shows businesses leaders support Harris would be great.

Content: Hi,
 
What a difference a few weeks make!
 
Harris-Walz is surging, Trump-Vance is flailing. But the election still looks to be razor close, especially in swing states.
 
To that end, I‚Äôm pleased to report that the video series is gaining attention across the ‚ÄúBlue Wall,‚Äù with Democratic officials from Susquehanna County, PA, to Oakland County, MI, to Polk County, WI, sharing the videos with voters. It‚Äôs also heartening to see leading news organizations reporting on the large number of former Trump Administration officials who are not endorsing Trump in 2024.  In that vein, Talking Points Memo just published a piece titled ‚ÄúThe Democrats Secret Weapon,‚Äù identifying leading figures from the Trump Administration who are opposing him now. And I‚Äôd expect that the Democratic Convention, which starts August 19, will feature former Trump officials who are now supporting Harris-Walz.
 
Indeed, an extraordinary percentage of Trump‚Äôs former cabinet appointees ‚Äì almost 50% ‚Äì are not supporting him in 2024. For good reason. Watch (https://ourfutureourchoice.net/compilation/) as high-level appointees explain why they left the Trump Administration sounding the alarm. And please share this link with neighbors, friends, colleagues, and relatives.
 
Please also Like and Share this video via social media.

Content: I agree and wanted to add some ideas.  I was in conversation with a friend who said many of his co-workers are pro-trump, what do you have to say to them. I calmly said, I have nothing to say to them.  I have no need to try and talk to them, no desire to try and change their minds.  They are who they are. However, there are more of us than there are of them. My job is to make sure all of us are informed, registered and vote.  It ended the conversation easily and we moved on.  And oh my god do we all need to learn how to delete, hide or mute comments on our feeds. don't argue, don't engage, just delete.  They can have their "free speech" elsewhere. Just not on my feed.

Content: Stolen valor refers to taking credit for military service or credentials you didn't earn. Trump likes to pretend he earned a Purple Heart, for example. Some men parade about in military dress, complete with fake medals. It's an insult to those who served.

Content: I was just about to mention this. Also, Trump was given a Purple Heart from a vet who supported him and he said, "I always wanted one." Now I have an uncle who has since passed away but he was in Vietnam as a tunnel rat and he was awarded three Purple Hearts. He didn't go in saying, "I always wanted this," he got it for doing service to the country. Also, after the third time, he didn't want to go back because he told everyone that he knew that would be the one that killed him. He came out of Vietnam alive but in a way it did kill him because he died in 2015 from health issues related to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam.

Content: I have encountered a few people saying Walz has stolen valor. I remember the Trump statement. I am unsure why they are stating that, I am aware he served in the Army, NG, to CSM, in 1/125 in MI, but beyond that I believe it's them that is mistaken. I am not sure what I am missing.

Content: I gather from the scans that he retired just as his National Guard unit was called to go to Iraq in 2005. Napkin math says he was ~41 at the time. https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/08/06/tim-walz-who-spent-decades-enlisted-soldier-brings-years-of-work-vets-issues-dem-ticket.html says he retired honorably. He has never claimed to serve in combat. He immediately went into the house of representatives and started working for veterans. This idea that he abandoned his unit is a big stretch.

Content: Hey all‚Ä¶A couple great posts that show Trump and JD Vance do NOT care about our military veterans. JD said ridiculous things about Tim Walz‚Äô military record of service and it was both FALSE and uncalled for. Feel free to repost these images

Content: I just shared it on Threads, Bluesky, Countersocial, and Spoutible.

I'm not on Xitter. Left due to privacy/security  concerns when Musk took over. I had 6k followers but didn't blink at deleting a 15-year old account. 

I've deleted as many years' worth of Facebook posts, but I'm still active there and have 2k friends on my personal profile and about 1k followers on my (mostly apolitical) author page.

Content: My favorite memes are: 

Educational (simple explainers on Project 2025 citing source page # accurately);

Fun(ny) but truthful (not sinking to the level of the bullies we loathe in the GOP, but mocking bad ideas and uplifting good ones.

What's your favorite meme right now, and why?

There's so many.  Grab 'em by the Walz is hilarious.  Also, I don't know if you all saw the "Trump is a Chicken" video meme. I made it for Content Brigade and everyone I have shown this to has laughed their head off.

Content: I really hope they go with the no crowd format for all of these. It's far too easy for him to install his (disproportionately) disruptive MAGA sycophants in the audience.

Content: In my less than humble opinion, no debate should have a crowd. That's what rallies are for. During debates the candidates should concentrate on the topics, and an audience tends to be distracting. That being said, that's so much more the case with someone like Trump.

Content: Re: Message of the Day "Meet VP Pick Tim Walz"
A couple suggestions:
1. Please make sure these message of the day items get added as "Action Cards" in Reach. It makes it so easy to share.
2. The link you shared goes to another video when the ad ends. I recall that it is possible in YouTube to create links that simply cycle back to allow viewers to replay the ad. You may want to use those features.

Hope this is helpful.

Content: A general question >> how can I be impactful in a blue state? most of my online communities are local to the Bay Area, and myself like to protect my online profile because I work in social media for tech companies and I want to remain non-partisan for fear of alienating coworkers or customers. the only place i let loose is my personal IG (which i keep private)  where i frequently post reels, images, and other news, etc. does anyone have any advice for maximizing reach?

Content: I saw an amazing video out of Tennessee where a very hopeful man was saying how they could turn their red state blue if every voting blue person just found one person to take to the polls with them to vote blue. I think that's an amazing idea! There's so many people who don't get out to the polls just because their day gets busy or they don't have transportation or they don't have somebody to watch their kids. If you could be that one person to help that one person get to the polls that day, we could flip these red States!

Content: Favorite meme? I don't know if this is a meme yet? However, someone juxtoposed  Gov. Walz signing free lunch with a bunch of happy jubilant  children & Sarah Huckabee Sanders lowering the working age , with a small group of children who seemed very low energy.

Content: I created this *very low effort* chart, like a resume for both major tickets, to highlight the differences in public service experience (as well to highlight the lack thereof on the republican ticket). I might pretty it up in Canva as it could be an important point to call out. Feel free If anyone on the content team also wants to take a stab at it üí™üèº

Content: <@568257600228032512> Love all the content people are sharing and the library in Reach! I would love some sourced graphics with facts on kitchen table issues. Here‚Äôs an example from a person I follow  on IG. I see a TON of misinformation about the economy passed off as ‚Äúfact‚Äù when I know it‚Äôs BS. I want to have some sourced info to counter. Any tips or good places for me to look? Thanks for all the help!

Content: I had a really interesting insight from the Medium posts I've written about Kamala and Tim - both around climate and environmental sustainability. When I focus on the story being about Kamala and Tim, not much engagement. When I focus on what they've done - the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and making Minnesota a climate action powerhouse - there's a lot more engagement. Not totally surprising since my Medium readers are focused on climate and sustainability, not politics. But it's an interesting learning to focus on the topic first in the headline and lead, and then connect to Kamala and Tim later in the piece.

Content: I assume everyone is here with best intentions. I saw some content that made me cringe. I don't think it's a good idea to call wearing eyeliner creepy and weird. I'm not in favor of making fun of people's appearance and anybody should be able to wear eyeliner if they want to. I think it's a distraction from the backward policies he supports.

Content: Hi Folks - I work mainly in the twitter-community-notes group. I thought you might find it helpful to have the attached collection of fact-checking articles from 7-17-24 to 8-7-24. The links use bitly to make them very short for posting. The articles have been super helpful for Community Notes.  I draw from Kessler at Wash. Post, Factcheck.org, Politifact.com & Snopes.com.

Content: Hi Laura, I appreciate your opinion. We do reach out to redirect folks whose messaging distracts from our purpose. We encourage content that highlights hope, joy, freedom, etc. This is a community for everyone and we need to consider how the messages are seen/understood by everyone. On the flip side, there are folks who want to share the cringy messages with their communities and we don't want to alienate them either. It's a fine line, and we do remove items that blatantly cross it.

Content: I've had fun playing around with slogans about the "swift-boating" of Tim Walz, for example, "Hey MAGA, you may try to swift-boat Tim Walz, but we have Swifties for Walz & Harris https://x.com/Swiftie4Harris   üòé   Many won't know about the swift-boating of John Kerry, so this may need a one-sentence explanation. The scary thing is that the attacks on the highly decorated Kerry probably caused his defeat.  Mostly trying to bring you a smile  üòé & to let know about swifites4Harris.

Content: Welcome Steve! The campaign will work with the DNC during the convention and post their policy positions after that. There is a lot of great content on Walz's previous work and accomplishments in the Reach app and in <#1250876565366243348>. We don't have official responses yet to single issue questions but stay tuned after the convention!

Content: Just a quick note and reminder for FB users: when you share videos or links in main posts, the algorithm often suppresses them. I've seen this in action again during the past couple of days as I comment on the addition of Tim Walz to the ticket. 

Very little reaction, but all good, to a comment about being happy to finally see the positive small town values highlighted when accompanied by a shared video in post.

Much more reaction on my feed, again all positive, to a very similar comment today where I posted a video link in the comment section.  However, I don't think as many people clicked on the video.

Content: I made a twitter account to help amplify messaging, and not even 5 days had gone by when the account was hacked, they deleted everyone I was following and I can no longer get into the account. Supremely disappointed. I was like, "wow.....ok."

Content: It's an uphill battle on there, but my perspective is that any tweet that gets out there, can help in some small algorithmic way. It's better than not trying at all. But I also understand the frustration that comes with it.

Content: So twitter feels these days as if it's mainly right-wingers.  If the idea is to motivate middle or lefties, that seems to be more of a threads/bsky endeavor.

I can‚Äôt find anything on Reach or here to address this or the Gaza issue they say the hecklers were yelling about. Can someone direct me so that I can appropriately respond?

Content: I think because Twitter has been such an institution of social media, it's hard to give up. So while the smaller minority of extreme republicans have much more amplified voices now, it's really a just fight to try not to let the platform crumble...for better or worse. Because a lot of people do still use it. But yea...

Content: Exactly. And if there's limited time and water (energy/resources), then it might be best to focus on a smaller patch? Most of us can't be effective everywhere. All of us CAN be effective somewhere. The trick is figuring out how to optimize (something I'm still working on).

Content: Twitter really is a ghost town and still only has meaning for already established media accounts (usually with a financial interest in continuing there.)  Not much there for individual users, certainly not new ones. That‚Äôs why replies do better than posts. No ones following or sharing.   

That said, everyone should be engaging in whatever platform they are comfortable on. There are a lot of fronts to this effort and I understand not conceding any spaces online. Hell, the campaign posts on Truth Social even!

Turfe, the deputy Wayne County executive, who is the highest ranking Arab American official in Michigan‚Äôs largest county. Turfe told The Associated Press that he spoke with Harris backstage at the event before his endorsement."

Content: Hi Leigh, I know it's frustrating but we can't opine, as volunteer moderators/guides, on what the campaign's positions will officially be when they haven't released them yet. The campaign is so new. We do wish we could help on single issue talking points. You could refer to previous work and statements they've made if you want to research that, but we don't know if those will be their official positions after the convention. You could ask them to let you get those positions after the convention or talk about what they've previously said/done.

Content: Maybe sharing the longer video? She had a very respectful response saying something like democracy means all our voices matter but I‚Äôm speaking right now, and then continued yelling for over 30 seconds before she responded the way people are annoyed by. 
So I think that context explains why she was fed up with the disruptiveness? Like even though I also feel strongly about the ceasefire, that protest was not effective at all

Content: Hi Folks, I‚Äôve been close to dropping off X-Twitter, but I've been more committed since I‚Äôve been doing community notes. Studies show that ‚ÄúX users repost content 61% less often once it receives a community note. Original posters delete their content faster once they receive a community note.‚Äù Also, I‚Äôve gotten lots of great content and news from those I follow. You might like to see this recent report on X-twitter usage, demographics and more. Barack Obama's account is the second most popular after Elon, and more than Taylor Swift! Who knew?

Content: since the DNC is putting together their platform now, the best thing they can do is call their closest Democratic representative and let them know who they feel - many people are understandably upset! but it's not worth letting it become a wedge issue, not when we have our representatives ears, and not when we're so close to sending a strong anti-authoritarian message. Apathy will not solve this - but I think it's also important to note that if you have close friends who feel strongly about this, give them sympathy. give them room to vent. Be a friend first. We've got 80-something days and a whole DNC to do. There's time to grapple and process. We have a wealth of compassion to draw on, and sometimes we have to show that first.

Content: Sortof.  It only will connect to the fedi servers willing to connect to it.  There's a fedipact among many servers to block threads altogether because their content moderation is sub-par.

Content: Thanks much, Megan, for your thoughts on how to respond to those who are angry and disillusioned with the U.S. stance on the Hamas-Israeli war. Yes, give sympathy and space to those who say "no ceasefire, no vote."   I thought Kamala's response to hecklers in Detroit was too abrupt. She did meet with reps from the Arab American community before the rally, and as a result, an Arab American official is now supporting Kamala.    In AZ yesterday, she had a longer response to hecklers saying the administration is working around the clock to get a ceasefire & bring the hostages home. I am working on talking points on this topic, using AOC's wonderful response and Kamala's official statements. Many credit Kamala for having more empathy for the Palestinian's plight & stronger on the need for a ceasefire than Biden.  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/07/25/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-following-meeting-with-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-of-israel/  https://www.thewrap.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-biden-gaza-war/

Content: Reposted from <#1260333091319451660> by me (this is more of a deep dive)
Little thing I wrote up about Tim's Nickname by Republicans/GOP

Walz being called "Tampon Tim" by Republicans/GOP is actually doing our work for us; as we can see on this article by The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/10/republicans-tampon-tim-walz) Tim Walz actually made mandates for Schools to have Free Mensturation Products, The Guardians Arwa Mahdawi states "...mandated public schools offer free menstruation products in their bathrooms." Additionally, Mahdawi states that "Tampons are expensive! And ‚Äúperiod poverty‚Äù ‚Äì the inability to afford menstruation supplies ‚Äì is a serious problem in the US." This New York Post Article shows how expensive Tampons & Pads are getting (https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/business/tampon-pad-prices-nearly-double-over-last-5-years-due-to-inflation/)  As they have doubled the prices over the past 5 years. 

The Menstrual Products being funded by the State Government is **true** in https://www.house.mn.gov/sessiondaily/Story/17937 one of the many things the bill does is quote "$3.6 million for menstrual products..." showing the bill provides schools funding for Menstrual Products.

Apologies for this being legnthy, but in conclusion Republicans are actually doing some good press for the Harris-Walz Campaign by naming Tim Walz "Tampon Tim". Despite them trying to make fun of him with the name.

Content: 3:30 to 3:50 timestamps on leaked project 2025 video they quote stalin and hitler and then AGREE with them "if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it". Someone should clip that and then show clips of all of trumps major lies (with proof on screen that its a lie). I dont know how to do this, I'm sorry, but this would be a very powerful message to potential voters I feel. Here is a link to the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob2nmb97OkY

Yesterday: What was your go to movie as a child? The Goonies! I love that movie so much! Also, Beetlejuice and yes, I do plan on seeing the new on in September!
Today: Where is the furthest you have traveled from your hometown? I went to Florida a couple of times. Didn't like it that much. Most of the time these days, I'll go to the NJ shore points and that's about it.

Content: I have a newspaper putting out an article telling our state non citizens are voting - a sitting representative sending out an email targeting democrat donors - and another media outlet targeting our homeless community right in the middle of our early election  - and I don't know what to do with any of it.

Content: Oh my! you can write a response to the newspaper if they have a space for community contributions. If you know who the democrat donors are you can send emails countering the representative. Not sure what to suggest for the media outlet and the homeless.

Content: Not sure if it will help speed up the process but I've been using Claude.ai to counter mis/disinformation.  It's done a brilliant job so far.   And have been able to use the output in community notes etc. 

Just make sure you double check what it comes back with cause it's not always perfect.

Content: Hi Zuny - Here is a fact-check article on non-citizen voting I have used, and I state in my posts: "Non-citizen voting is EXTREMELY rare, as found by right & left-leaning foundations.  Non-citizens have no incentive to vote ‚Äì they risk deportation & jail."

Content: I friended a Republican today on Facebook who was answering a question on a post by an apparent Kamala supporter. The question was asked after a bit of hype about Kamala‚Äôs rise in the polls and her crowd sizes at her rally: What can we do to keep this momentum going. Surprisingly a Republican posted an answer that made total sense. He said, ‚ÄúKeep posting the excitement and show how large these crowds are at Kamala‚Äôs rallies. Post about the well known Republicans who are endorsing Kamala/Walz. And most important don‚Äôt argue with Trump supporters online, not only is it a waste of time but also because they like the attention. I would like to add that he also suggested Trump memes are not effective at all in convincing republicans but I know it keeps the excitement going and sometimes laughter is the best medicine for my current followers supporting Kamala and Walz.

Content: I think most of them are behind the scenes laughing at the memes. We used them a lot in the Fetterman campagin and it seems people loved it. Of course I always get told to stop posting about this stuff by Republicans so this is refreshing.

Content: I also wanted to mention something I think you probably already know, if Kamala and Walz win this election, there will probably be not only civil unrest from the far right (as promised by Trump) but also I was reading Pro-Trump election deniers have been put in place in all of the swing states. This could be scaring off potential voters who might have consequences to pay if they are Harris endorsers. I was wondering what plan is in place to help me ensure voters that his plan to steal the election regardless of the results will fail. Rachel Maddow recently pointed out in a video that Trump is now telling his supporters ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need votes‚Äù ‚Äúyou are not going to have to vote.‚Äù etc. https://youtu.be/of9OP_a6MNg

Content: Shawn, There may be well-placed election deniers in some states. However, many from our side are well-placed, too. That means any shenanigans will be made public right away. Also, this time around the sitting POTUS and the DoJ are working to proactively address corruption and illegality. The risk comes from a very close election. That‚Äôs why we need Harris/Walz to win big. Winning big‚Äîthrough optimism, commitment and GOTV efforts‚Äîwill thwart their plans to meddle.

Used the Reach app to locate the audio of tRump talking to Walz and saying how happy he was with Walz‚Äôs response and boy did that put an end to that misinformation thread. Lots of favorable responses to it as well. Yay Reach!

Content: so first off all, it wasn't a snitch hotline, it was a question hotline, for people who had questions about a covid, which as we can all remember, there were a Lot. Calling it a snitch line is a gross mistatement of an effort to help people who are feel more comfortable making direct phone calls, like many in the elderly population.

Content: I think saying Walz 'oversaw the largest covid fraud scheme' is a lie. A Minnesota audit was able to uncover the largest dollar amount of fraud of all the states, and all participants uncovered have been charged. Why is this being pinned specifically on Governor? Fraud was rampant - look at the Brett Favre situation in Mississippi, for example.

Content: I think we should be mindful of sharing any AI art or text that you see out there.

I believe AI usage will be a continuing theme in the election and could be a repeated attack against Dems like we saw with the totally fabricated story about the so called ‚ÄúAI crowds‚Äù for Harris, so best not to muddy the waters in any way.

Also, there is a sizable group that is vehemently against AI art, and campaign/supporter usage could really irk them.

Would love to hear others opinions, though- I am not necessarily against AI in general but just have concerns on usage in elections.

Content: As Harris-Walz pulls ahead, I'm seeing an increase in MAGA trolls and bots across my other online networks. Here's a timely reminder from a Reddit poster:  Be particularly wary of the ‚Äúconcern trolls‚Äù and the ‚Äútime waster trolls‚Äù. The doomer posts that try to get us to worry are sometimes from ‚Äúconcern trolls‚Äù who pretend to be democrats and aim to spread fear, doubt, division, and anxiety. Downvote, report and move on. Do not engage.
The naive innocent question posts are also sometimes ‚Äútime wasting trolls‚Äù or AI bots who aim to waste your time. The posts demanding that you justify your vote in detail or posts demanding a response to convince the poster to vote for Harris are designed for this purpose. Just ignore them (some are in good faith‚Ä¶check post history).
Above all, please do not engage the trolls. Just downvote, report them and move on.
Engaging with the trolls creates more troll comments which only creates more work for our wonderful moderators. (Thank you mods for your hard work!)

Content: Personally, I find the trolls and bots super taxing b/c it is in my DNA to be a helper and I instinctively want to engage. As a result, I can get led down rabbit holes and waste time. On the plus side, I'm getting more confident in the talking points. lol

But you‚Äôre right that it‚Äôs a time and energy suck to engage with clearly bad faith posters. I usually just dip out of a conversation over having a long back-and-forth

It does seem like timewaster bots. My views keep going up on this post tx to these but I just have to leave them filtered I guess and stop and go on. Any advice or resources?

Content: dont delete them. Just dont engaged. The people viewing the post will leave comments regardless of side and that just feeds the Algo. keep it up, dont respond to negative stuff. I like to go through and thank or agree with people who i agree with. but other than that i dont interact

Content: Okay so maybe this might need to be addressed a little more in the Part 1 and Part 2 Digital Engagement Training since I was trying torn and posting but also trying to engage when someone seemed a normies. And as someone said to educate others and respond to misinformation. So I guess not to be black or white but *for the most part* at least on TikTok posting content might be the focus and not spend time commenting, right?

Content: the current plane is N550GP - you can find pics of it in a hastily-applied Trump 2024 livery. It was previously registered as N212JE under Epstein's ownership. If you look up both registrations, you'll see that the serial number - 5173 - is the same

Content: Tx so much Charlie and Carolyn! Really helpful. I will continue focus on content ( FYI On TikTok video from Reach is not offered beyond followers.) Then will spend the next day blocking those thousands of commenters in my comment filter when I find the time. Tx!

Content: Today‚Äôs icebreaker: I am motivated to help in this election because of the erosion of our rights and national security we saw when Trump was in office, and my dismay that so many remain under the spell of right wing propaganda.

During 45‚Äôs term I realized that he was not intelligent or disciplined enough to have reached the Oval Office alone, but I felt like it wasn‚Äôt only Putin/RU mafia behind him, that there were American teammates. Except the alt-right, I did not know who. Project 2025 was the missing piece of that puzzle. Heritage and something like 60 orgs were the policy brains that explained the disconnect between Trump‚Äôs actions and his personal character.

It is going to take many of us persisting through adversity to maintain our freedom. I see that now. Before Trump I had opinions. Now I have experience. And yes, I am scared. But there‚Äôs no good option other than to work.

Content: YouTube chat is notoriously bad about trolls. It's kinda limited and the faster the chat moves the harder it is. They have a security bot but it can only do so much.

Content: I‚Äôm motivated because I realized that even as an individual, I have power in this situation. My first election was 2016, which launched me into a political landscape that was radically different from what I‚Äôd come to expect as a child. My second was 2020, during Covid and quarantines - I felt like I was at the mercy of the world around me. 

A lot of friends of mine in both elections either voted 3rd party or didn‚Äôt vote, and their vocal despair got to me. It made me angry but I also agreed with them. But since then, I‚Äôve come to reevaluate my opinions and realize that I don‚Äôt have to be powerless - I can engage friends in discussion, I can push back on misinformation, I can donate to campaigns, I can make content to share with my groups. I don‚Äôt have to take the world lying down - and that‚Äôs very encouraging to me. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm motivated in this election.

Content: Unfortunately, you'd have to signup directly in those swing states.  In swing states, you can choose to volunteer with Kamala's campaign, Congressional campaigns or even state campaigns.  Each campaign would have their own events.

You can add those swing state's channels here, but those channels aren't very active yet.  I'd recommend joining the much larger [state groups](https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/groups) on FB and just ask the in-state volunteers for guidance.  It's also a good way to familiarize yourself with the state's issues, so their voters can't easily tell that you're not a neighbor.

Content: I agree. I work on an AI adjacent engineering team in my day job and I know how exciting AI tools can be, but it's contentious right now and I would steer clear of it, even for meme making. 

The tools definitely shouldn't be used for anything that someone might mistake as reality, even if that's not the intention.

Content: My motivation is that I am old, I do not want to see my country going fascist when my dad was in WWII. This is not what our constitution says, nor what the majority of the people want. It is just plain unAmerican to want to take away people‚Äôs rights, to other groups so you can rachet up hate. I want these people back to where they don‚Äôt feel they have the right to minority rule.
I also want something done about using lies to your constituents or to your audience for profit or propaganda.

Content: I live in a swing state, Nevada. You saw the rally in Las Vegas last Saturday. Many of my friends were there. But that still leaves all of rural Nevada which is much more conservative. Campaigning there is hard because it's miles and miles of nothing but miles and miles. We have a coordinated campaign office, so if you want to help, just go to NVDems.com.

Content: üßäToday‚Äôs Icebreaker üßä
What makes you motivated to help out in this election?

I was looking at this question and I started thinking of a conversation I had with Colton today in a video call. I told him how I've worked on campagins since 2016 and in that year, I worked as a field volunteer with PA Dems in lower Bucks County. There was this little girl that came in and she was asking for anything related to Hillary and I remember giving her a piece of campaign lit we had that had Hillary's photo on it and the heartbreak of seeing Hillary lose.  That's the one thing that always kept me going.

I did a lot since then from texing into several states in 2020 to spending the 2022 midterms running phone and text banks for PA Dems during the week and knocking on doors in Bristol, PA on the weekends. I still have the selfies of me with John & Gisele Fetterman from 2022 along with a photo of me with then Vice President Biden in 2016 and a photo of me and a group of field volunteers in 2016 with President Clinton. This time I keep thinking it's different because we learned from the mistakes of 2016 and we are taking an approach I only saw as a campaign volunteer once before which was in 2022 with the midterm elections in PA. I know right now we're also taking an approach which is very similar to Obama but I keep thinking of the excitement of 2022 in PA and the heartbreak of 2016 and when Kamala said, "We're not going back," I was like, "And this won't be like 2016."

Content: Just joined officially on Saturday, but I've been posting to my FB friends all year, since many are Republican and leaning family and friends "back home" (some of whom are at least reasonable and possibly persuadable), sharing articles with excerpts or my intro comments and also some memes, hoping to sow the seeds of doubt or show them how outrageous their leader is and how their party has gone astray.  I try to use sources with mainstream credibility (which means they'll still be accused of being "the liberal media"), and especially like to share articles authored by Never Trump Republicans/conservatives. I hit often on Trump's disrespect for military service members and his blatant immorality and, more recently, his incoherence and age. I've begun using some of the materials on Reach displaying the positive, upbeat approach of Harris-Walz and talking turn-out and its importance for younger voters.

Content: I live in South Carolina and have always voted but have also stayed pretty centrist- so it is rare that a politician grabs by imagination.  I remember when that happened in Summer of 2019 with Pete Buttigieg- I saw him speak at a rally on TV and the next day I went to what turned out to be the grand opening of his local campaign HQ and met one of his organizers, Kat Thames.  Kat taught me and her group of volunteers how to knock on doors and make cold calls and join text campaigns and we even met Pete together!  We worked hard and became very close- we are still in touch with each other.  Pete actually won our piece of South Carolina on the day of the primary!  We did something right!  This moment with the Harris Walz campaign brings those feelings back to me- we can actually turn this tide of potential disaster into something fun and hopeful- we can grow peace,  joy and belonging in this world!!

Content: It‚Äôs a way for you to map the online communities that you are a part of.

So say you have a group on Facebook that you interact with, it gives you space to list out details on that space, like how the group leans (is it mostly pro-Harris?)

Just a way for you to map out your digital space and the sites/groups you are a part of online! That way you understand how you can better engage with those groups

Content: I use ai at my job for fun internal stuff - it once took over an hour to get a drawing of a lion in a old-timey swimsuit. I think we're still ways away from dystopian nightmare deepfakes, and I hope there's some regulation soon that would enforce a watermark on any visual generated by prompt. When it comes to writing, I've seen it be very useful for the very tedious corporate technical writing tasks that wouldn't excite even the most eager intern. Without careful and determined personal effort, it cannot be used for anything remotely creative.

Content: I asked what was influencing this persons vote and they gave this response. "Christian values, the economy so working class can thrive again like they did under Trump, the open border crisis and the almost 100,000 missing migrant children caused by Kimala and Bidens policies, the fact we are almost in world war 3 due to their weakness. Boggles my mind why anyone who has lived through the last few years would ever consider that corrupt evil woman and her lying running mate. I choose to vote for freedom, peace, strength, and prosperity for the sake of my children's future!"

Content: It's a little tricky because these take a lot of time to go through one by one, and sometimes people with this mindset don't want to listen. Maybe start by asking what Trump policy benefitted them or the country and see if you can establish how Trump didn't do anything for the economy except ruin it in 2020. I think that's a good area to start in because economy is #1 this election as always.

Content: Pretty much, the short answer is, you know their position is hard no and there is too much to overcome. There is no uncertainty, no, ‚ÄúUndecided, don‚Äôt engage online. I‚Äôd personally Attend the training roots music advised. There is one tomorrow and there may be some ways to have a more productive discussion face to face and or online.   There are lots of objections to overcome in that one and personally, time may be better spent sharing with undecideds and needs more info and involving decideds.  Definitely attend the part 2 training it will help you triage.

Content: hey so i currently have over 1K for my watch party monday night, and more as the day goes on, and I've been trying to get ahold of my local democratic party but after talking with the lgbtqia+ causcus liaison to south jersey, i was belittled and demeaned in a way that i no longer wanted to be part of the lgbtqia+ causcus. No one else from the party has contacted me, regardless of emails, phone calls, text, or comments in the NJ channel. I really feel like im being ghosted by my party and I'm just trying to get nj canidates infront of my audience. any suggestions?

Content: I was hoping to just get a member of the party to sit down with me and talk to my audience about how to get involved at a local level, the different types of caucuses, how to set those up, the importance of primiaries. Plus like the canidates policies, why we should vote for them, things like that. Just a regular interview and hangout session  where people can get to know and trust people. Or i wanted to stream the grand opening of a new HQ but thats tomorrow and I still havent heard anything

Content: and i did connect with the LGBTQ+ liaison but after explaining why i was reaching out and how i can help, she told me people only wanted a social club and until the youth show up we have no idea what they can offer. So i really didnt want to contune talking to someone that thought so little of younger voters. They also then told me I was judging them, making fun of them, and said it was because shes a "boomer" her words not mine. I can upload the emails but i just dont know what to do anymore.

Content: also, this isnt a judgement on anyone, but like, i wish i knew about these things before now. I only found out about the discord because someone on tumblr mentioned it because i talked about my problem on there. The liaison even expressed that we dont probably vote for the same reasons as she's a senior citizen. And i did express that I talk about better nursing home and end of life care facility regulations. More funding and science for Alzhiemers. Reducing the deffense budget to help veterans. these are things i activily use my platform for and to be told I dont care about the same things as her was just frankly insulting. She mentioned that they would like me to help get more volunteers to join, but then started talking about how no one wants to show up because its not a social club or a bar. I recommened that maybe a gay night at a local club hosted by the caucus might be a really good idea. Especially if the canidate was there. Like in parks and rec. people love that level of connection.

Content: and this is just info dump at this point, but my mom was in hospic for a majority of my life, so i watch and heard about a lot of people dying while i sat there and did my home work either at the house with the patient or home. The elderly is something i VERY MUCH care about, because im very aware i will end up there with most likely a diagonoses for alzheimers. so it was just a massive slap in the face to hear her say i dont care.

Content: Charlie, don‚Äôt feel alone in that, in the past, I have found that there are many people within local chapters, (even the dem county ones)  often feel threatened if you are excelling or have a high level of experience. Many want paid positions and or to attend conventions. Do you and keep moving forward. Your light will shine regardless!  1000 people is an amazing accomplishment and proof your light is shining.

Its not something i can easily talk about. but your level of kindness its very much appreicated. ‚ù§Ô∏è i almost at 1,100 since posting that. So i guess im doing something okay. I also send out an email with my info and stuff so people can decide if they want to cancel or not before they see me on screen. 18 cancels isnt terrible lol.

Content: Not sure where best to post this info: I saw some  analysis in WaPo this morning, quoting Blueprint polling analysis, suggesting that positive messaging about Harris/Walz is more effectvie than negative messaging about Trump.  tl;dr:  Voters are eager for fresh, positive messaging about Harris, and most voters (71%) have already made up their mind about Trump and won't be swayed by any additional negative messaging about him.

An update: I still haven't cleared 1200 filter comments out yet but as you suggested, I just blocking the horse hoax bad actors and usually I wake up to 5000 views and a 1000 more comments but now my views stopped cold at 62K. I actually think this is a good thing since it fan it's course long ago and I felt it actually was not being offered to folks but that it was a concerted effort.  You and Charlie were just what the doctor ordered.

But the energy is so great, I have never seen anything like this before, although 2008 was pretty exciting but there wasn't as much online sharing so I didn't get to enjoy the rallies like now.

Content: Wowzah!  The Coach (Tim Walz) has spoken!  Time for the Choir to Sing!  If you need something to motivate family and friends or your activist team to do some meaningful volunteering for this election, have them watch Tim Walz give his speech to AFSCME, particularly starting at minute 17:00 onward.  Here is my transcription of what "sang" to me ... 

"Hope is the most powerful word in the English Language...Hope is a great word and a beautiful name¬†but is not a damn Plan.¬† We can't hope that we defeat Donald Trump. We can't hope that we can collectively bargain.¬† We can't hope that we protect Social Security.¬† We can't hope that we address climate change. You don't hope to win. You PLAN, PREPARE and WORK to WIN.¬† .... How many friends can we bring to the polls?¬† ... If each of us does an extra shift, an extra hour, a little bit more, we get to wake up on that morning after the election and know that the work we did transformed the lives for millions, transformed generations, impacted the world. .... That's a plan. That's how the hope turns into the reality turns into improved lives.¬† ... We organize, we donate, we volunteer.¬† We will sleep when we are dead, we will do the WORK now!"

Content: When i am spreading awareness for Project 2025 these are the most common themes for attacks i am getting from conservatives. These are all pretty easy to counter if you just spend a little time familiarizing yourself with them. I like to have some canned responses ready when someone uses one of these attacks.

Content: 1. **Clarification of Trump‚Äôs Involvement**
   - Many comments insist that Project 2025 is not Trump's project and emphasize that he has publicly disavowed it.
   - **Examples:**
     - "Trump denounced having anything to do with it."
     - "Trump said he didn't agree with some of the stuff in Project 2025. It's not his project."

2. **Attribution to Heritage Foundation**
   - Comments frequently point out that Project 2025 is an initiative of the Heritage Foundation, not something authored or endorsed by Trump.
   - **Examples:**
     - "Project 2025 is a transition plan from the Heritage Foundation, not Trump."
     - "Project 2025 was from a think tank."

3. **Accusations of Spreading Misinformation**
   - Several comments accuse the original post of spreading false information or deliberately misleading readers about Trump‚Äôs connection to Project 2025.
   - **Examples:**
     - "Why do you lie?"
     - "Stop spreading misinformation."

4. **Suggestions for Fact-Checking and Reliable Sources**
   - Comments advise others to seek information from more credible or authoritative sources, highlighting the importance of critical evaluation of information.
   - **Examples:**
     - "Do we remember the difference between .com .net .org and .edu?"
     - "Always consider that when viewing anything."

5. **Claims of Political Fear-Mongering**
   - Some comments suggest that the post is an attempt to create unnecessary fear or panic for political purposes.
   - **Examples:**
     - "Go fearmonger elsewhere, bot."
     - "Don‚Äôt fall for political fear-mongering."

6. **Dismissal and Ridicule**
   - Some comments dismiss the concerns about Project 2025 as overreactions or mock the premise of the original post.
   - **Examples:**
     - "Project 2025 is heritage foundation fanfic."

Content: When you‚Äôre looking at where to engage, you might want to look at micro-influencers and pages that have followings of ~10K-100K people

These profiles are considered more accessible than bigger influencers, have more engaged communities, and probably have a niche which you can shape messaging around, giving you more natural ways to engage.

(Its a little buzzword-y, but helpful to visualize the next online spaces you can engage in)

Content: That sucks that people are either being rude, or gatekeeping. It happens. 
I would check with various levels within your local party. You should have precinct leaders, a county party, a congressional chair, a state party, and the local campaign or another candidate. Find a down ballot candidate that wants the captive audience. You could invite someone from your local board of elections. As Shirley Chisolm said, "If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair."

Content: Hi Charlie- I'm just another human but are you saying you want a candidate to come online with you DURING the DNC? That doesn't seem like a realistic ask. They are going to have stuff going on and if you are Watching the DNC- then how could you be interviewing someone? I'm not really seeing what you are envisioning. Maybe save that for AFTER the DNC?

Content: sorry for the delay, im streaming right now. but i wasnt trying to get them on camera the week of the DNC, i am WELL aware that is very hard to do with how busy everyone is. With streaming, I can have people come on at any time. I can stream all day before the speeches start and chat with people then, like a regular live stream. ^-^ I just like hanging out and chatting and all the people who signed up for the watch party know this. The volunteer sign up person who called me wanted to talk to the superdelegate at the local HQ opening tomorrow before he leaves for the weekend. The local chair was in the email exhange and other than that one Mod that reached out to me today, i havent heard anything other then the volunteer person telling me good luck and bye.

Content: like I know there arent going to be speeches going on 24-7 at the DNC next week, so I'll have time to kill between stuff so i dont end the stream to keep retention up. Its like a usual thing streamers do. If someone could sit with me and talk in my studio, cool, but i was only trying to first meet the super delegate at the HQ opening tomorrow. That was literalyy the entire point of the call/volunteer/ sign up everything

Content: It‚Äôs a popular concept in the digital marketing space- partnering or engaging with these micro-influencers is an easier and more accessible point to reach a sizable audience then trying to work with large influencers.

I like to extend the concept to pages (or subreddits) that fall into this general follower/subscriber size as well.

So for instance, you could sub to local or niche communities on reddit and be ready as a resource to discuss Harris/Walz plans that are relevant to that community, or the destructive impacts of Trump and Project 2025.

A hiking  or trail-running subreddit wouldn‚Äôt like the impacts to public spaces and parks, for instance. Neither would a local subreddit like Project 2025‚Äôs negative impacts on cherished local parks and community spaces.

Of course on reddit, this is complicated by some subs that are hostile to/don‚Äôt allow political posts. But you can still be a resource in these micro-communities if the topic comes up in the comments.

Content: Ok this is how i have been tackling the subject on Reddit. I am more of the outdoorsy educated type person so the national parks sub, the NOAA sub and a few others have been good for this. Im just not sure how to get the same effects on Instagram, Threads, FaceBook, Twitter (formerly known as profitable)

Especially if you feel your reach is limited or becoming tapped out within your existing network.

Content: Hi Shannon -- There's LOTS of back and forth on  X-twitter on whether Trump created Project 2025 [he did not] or whether he is likely to use it because of the close ties he and Vance have to the creators. There are videos from before Project 2025 of Trump praising its precursor.  A strategy I like is to show the overlap between Project 2025 & Agenda 47, which IS Trump's. Here is a chart I use to show that

Content: I don't do a whole lot of online engagement and the response to what I do post is usually favorable. That being said, I posted some content regarding project 2025, and received the following DM: 

That's all fake news. No such thing as project 2025. Our threats to democracy started when Biden's regime took over. Trump has already been president and did none of these things. This country was so much better under Trump's policies.

Is the kind of person that's not even worth engaging with? I feel like there's zero chance I could change her mind on anything so why waste my time and emotions, you know?

Content: Hi Shannon - Yes, I am not surprised Reach would have terms like "Trump's 2025 Project". Harris & Walz and all Dem officials and office holders use that phrase. It's more accurate to say that Project 2025 was created for the next conservative President, which is what the Heritage Foundation says.   It does seem obvious that most of the people working on  P2025 would have major roles in a Trump administration. The Foundation is also vetting loyalists who would take over on Day One - also the day Trump says he'll be "a dictator for a day." [but they say no dictator ever likes to give up that title üòé ]

Content: I don't really like harshing on any of their ages, personally.  I don't think the age is the issue.  I think mental decline and/or policies are the issue.  Nobody really put effort into harshing Ruth Bader Ginsberg over her age and she served until age 87.

Content: First, the campaign uses "Trump's Project 2025" to refer to Agenda 47 because Trump keeps trying to disavow P2025 in favor of the latter.  Second, both Heritage Foundation and Vance describes Heritage's current mission as "'institutionalizing Trumpism" (which is why Project 2025's contributors employs over 200 people from Trump's administration, including at cabinet-level).  By the way, did you create the comparison table between P2025 and Agenda 47?

Content: In addition to the Project 2025 link Alan suggested, donaldjtrump.com has its platform posted online and there is a huge correlation with the principal tenets of Proj. 2025 - Border Closings and Deportations, Weaponization of Justice Dept., ending Gender Identity protections, etc. -- you can always direct people there.  (Just be sure to wash your hands after going near that site! LOL üòâ )

Content: Hi Roots Music - Good point about emphasizing that P2025 is meant to "institutionalize Trumpism." It's too late for this, but it might have been better if Agenda 47 had been the main target. I got the chart on the similarities between Agenda 47 & Project 2025 from one of the many twitter posts that used it in late July.  Did a little checking just now and could not find its origins.

Content: Hi Folks - I want to retract my recent message that shared posts about Trump being too old. I hear what others are saying about age discrimination - it ain't about age.  Also, it ain't about memory. I found a great article by a psychologist who wrote about Trump's and Biden's decision-making abilities being much more important than their memories. Also found a health reporter video on why Trump's lifestyle puts him at risk for cognitive decline. Would be great if someone would pull out some quotes from the video. Here is a twitter post I put together:         Cognitive Psychologist: Biden and Trump may forget names or personal details, but what counts is that ‚Äú Biden regularly displays the deliberative dispositions that characterize good decision-making . . . [He] has extensive knowledge & experience . . . & thoroughly investigates & discusses diverse viewpoints with his advisers before reaching a decision. . . Trump has considerably less experience in politics. He claims that he can make intuitive decisions in a field where he lacks knowledge by using ‚Äúcommon sense.‚Äù. This claim contradicts the research showing that extensive job-specific experience and knowledge are necessary for intuitive decisions to be consistently effective.‚Äù https://bit.ly/3Xl4jKD A health reporter compares Biden‚Äôs & Trump‚Äôs lifestyles that could affect brain health, describing Trump‚Äôs heightened risk of cognitive decline  https://youtu.be/KLvX2s50ihk

Content: look on the right side of your screen on desktop.  If you don't see the list of people online, there's a button on the top right that looks like 2 little people that will toggle the list show on and off.

Content: this explains all the yellows i'm seeing...not a fan, personally... üü© ...I think it's generational...graphics get way more interaction than videos I post and I know it's because it's faster to read a good graphic than it is to watch a whole video.

I had to start a new facebook account and want to start building a new friend list of people to invite to regular zoom calls/attend postcard events, etc. Best ways to publicize and target local folks?  Thank you.

Content: Favorite moment in history? I have been privileged in my life to have seen many amazing moments. But the one that gave me chills and thrills was Nov 2008. I was on staff at the National Hq of the United Church of Christ. The entire staff of over 200 gathered in the meeting room with the giant TV screen to see the replay of the video from election night. We were simply proud that the country could elect him, but we were also proud because he was one of ours. He had belonged to a UCC church for a long time. Many of us were crying such happy tears. And here we are, again poised to elect a leader we can respect and admire. Let's do this!

Content: Quick question: Does anyone know of any content piece (i.e. chart, infographic, meme) that lists Kamala's policies that specifically benefit families? I found some in the Reach app listing single policies but none that have a full or partial list. If these don't exist, it may be a good idea to develop some as it's one of the questions I get from groups I engage with. I can help translate to Spanish as well if anyone with design skills is willing to create it.

Content: Really good stuff from Heather Cox Richardson:

Around 13:30, she gets into the Electoral College, and then after that talks about the certification.

The whole thing is good, but at the end, she talks about how Vance will actually be governing if trump wins. Because TFG has no interest...just staying out of jail. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqCGIMp6gXM&t=1s

Content: I'm going to go back to an obscure moment in recent history, which was the late spring of 2004. Alan Keys (r) was running for the IL senate seat, and made a stop at a Chicago high school. The young women who saw him speak were so upset by his lecture that they went on to make his opponent, state sen. Barack Obama, President of the United States.

If you have thoughts or know of something created that can be posted on Tic Tok let me know.

I‚Äôm doing engagement with folks who are leaning Harris, but they are in open forums where anyone could grab these links, and so I haven‚Äôt been sharing them, and instead sending them to mobilize or iwillvote. Is there SOP for this type of situation?

Content: Hey, I'll be around here today until 4PM. Feel free to ask if you have any questions since I'm not only a Discord mod but I'm also an OE lead (I have so much to do that I can't fit it all in)

 Let me answer this icebreaker. What is your favorite moment in history? Watching Hillary Clinton get the nomination in 2016 was a great moment for me. Also seeing Kamala become the first female VP was increadble. I watched the live stream from my kitchen that year and was in tears.

Content: That photo looks slightly AI generated. The letters are slightly crooked in spots and there's a bit of a swirl pattern in the building behind Trump that's characteristic of AI generation. It looks like someone generated the image and then cleaned it up a bit.

Content: You know I had to actually read this twice because the number one reason why I left a church was because of Trump. I went to an Evangelical church and they shamed me for being a Democrat. I never thought I'd see the day this would happen.

Content: This is a great idea. I recommend reaching out to your county Dems office. Most counties have precinct captains who are supposed to keep in touch with residents in their precincts. Doesn't always work that way in practice, but... Anyway, reaching out to your local Dems is helpful because it avoids duplicating efforts. Plus they can help with promotion, etc.  Good luck!

Content: ‚úÖ  I think it's time for the campaign to start promoting branded graphics with Voter Registration Deadlines for each state (and TV/YouTube ads -- and perhaps mention during rallies). 

I looked through a few states - seems that all deadlines are sometime in October -- and seems that "red" state deadlines are earlier in the month (interesting).

Content: todays icebreaker: whats the bes thing I've read recently-

I recently found out through a sciencific study that mushrooms are being used to clean up industrial waste sites in california with a 98% success rate. Once the mushrooms suck out most of the toxins the life begins to flood back into the area at an extremely incredible rate. Items broken down and obsorbed into the mushroom include: Lead, Arsenic, and a canvas bag full of lubed soaked rages from a bicycle repair shop. Once the mushrooms are full or behing to dye they are scooped up and taken to a toxic waste incenerator, turned to ask, and taken to an special landfil for just that reason.

Oh! and its being done by the person who started the "grow your own mushroom kits"

Someone brought up that this could be a great opportunity for the campaign to have some messaging around 'your vote is your vote' to give women who have partners who are for the opposition the reassurance they may need to vote their conscience. Just wanted to pass the info along!

Content: Wondering if there's content (image/meme or even better, a site) that explains, I don't know, basics of how the government works/ the role of a VP? So many ignorant comments all over like "Harris has as 1,300 days to do this...". It's quite concerning how little people understand and are blind to the idea of the fact of congressional gridlock. üòÖ

Content: I keep seeing the videos of MVP talking to girls (about 4-5 of them now) where she is so affirming and telling them they can do anything. She is also telling them to hold their heads up, look in her eyes, and shaking hands. It's so beautiful. Is there a video that pulls several of these clips together anywhere or a site to find them together. I would like to share with my groups online but I can't share 5 different links. Thank you!

Content: My favorite movie is "Under the Tuscan Sun".  It's about a woman who takes a chance. At the beginning of the movie dhe says all the things she wants. At the end of the movie another character points out she has everything she asked for - just not the way she thought it would be. Happiness is in your perspective.

Content: also <@447570500030562314> i have over 2K now signed up for my watch parties, will i hear back from anyone regarding being ghosted by the DNC after reaching out to help? Like i was streaming this on my own for my job as a content creator, only went to the website to volunteer my time, effort, and audience to help. It's been nothing but stress since i reached out and frankly im so dishearted that i dont even want to host it anymore.

Content: Hey, I'm here all afternoon if you need me. Ask questions, share info, have some fun.
I know the icebreaker question that Marta put in the OE Announcements has favorite movie. I have so many because I'm a movie freak. I love Mel Brooks so Spaceballs is an all time favorite (and yes, I'm excited about the possibility of a sequel) and I love The Jerk because to me Steve Martin is a LEGEND (big Only Murders fan here). I also love Good Time but right now I've been watching Beetlejuice a lot because I really want to see the sequel.

Content: I appreciate your efforts. please note: Kamala Harris was never a single mom (remember- she has not birthed any children, that was Vance's whole hideous comment) nor did she put herself through college working at MCD's . She worked there for "spending money". Just to clarify for everyone. Thanks!

Randy, too much ideology, not enough policy and realism.
What is important for economic efficiency is not capitalism, but the price system.
Interference with the price system by government OR BY PRICE-FIXING MONOPOLIES OR CARTELS are problems.
Just now realtors who loved free market rents; just had their own price-fixing outlawed.
The economic problem is not that Kamala's father might have been a marxist; it is that Kamala is a lawyer involved the court system. The court system operates by commands of a judge (according to law and legal precedent) as such is a command economy. The command model is the wrong model for the economy at large at least with respect to prices, quantities and styles generally. Long term price freezes below the price clearing level destroys supply (cartels raising prices above market clearing also causes an efficiency loss through over investment).  Price freezes are only a short term emergency fix, the long term fix is breaking up the price fixing cartels through anti-trust enforcement or artificially increasing supply through subsidies.

Content: I recently looked at data provided by the Department of Homeland Security on the ‚Äúmigration problem.‚Äù I was surprised by several aspects of the true nature of the issue, as opposed to a great deal of disinformation we are bombarded with.
I have a pdf with data and graphs I would like to share. How?
Here are the main points of the summary:
The total number of unauthorized entries in the Southwest border can be estimated between a quarter and a half million, a far cry from the approximately two and a half million reported encounters! The number of visitors overstaying their authorized entry to the US is significantly higher at about one million.

Encounters include apprehensions, inadmissibles, and expulsions. Nationwide encounters are, as of July 2024, about 170 thousand a month, their lowest post-pandemic level. Border encounters are often confused with ‚Äúborder crossings,‚Äù ‚Äúborder arrests,‚Äù ‚Äúillegal entries,‚Äù or a myriad of other terms.

The number of undocumented aliens living in the United States has hovered around 11 million for the last several years.

The estimated legally resident population is about 30 million or nearly three foreign-born legal residents in the US for each undocumented foreigner.

About one million migrants become US residents legally (half through family ties) each year.
Enjoy!
JRM

Content: Last time I looked into the issue - because I read that interview with Lankford where he asserted the 2.5 million number - it looked to be a willful misrepresentation. As far as I could tell it was a combination of 600,000 (which is the number of 'gotaways' that Sec. of Homeland Security Mayorkas cited in a hearing) + 1.9m encounters so far in 2024 OR 2.5m encounters for 2023. But encounters, of course, are not the same as the number of undocumented migrants making their way into the US and residing there permanently.

Content: Hiya my IG comments have been locked 3 times since the campaign started...it 
was unlocked for about 1/2 a day and now my comments are locked again.Is anyone else having issues with Instagram? Posting to my own account is rather pointless as it's just preaching to the choir...If I cannot comment to amplify the posts of others, I don't even know what good I'm doing other than keeping my own followers engaged in election info. Feels very much like being CENSORED... I really need help figuring out what the heck I'm doing that is causing this...I've been posting to mostly political accounts but have not been posting the same thing every time... I am moving very fast so I slowed down so they wouldn't think I was a bot... I posted pics of cats to my own acct and some jokes so it is more than just politics...i'm out of ideas. Oh! And I'm getting so little views that I'm pretty sure that I'm shadowbanned.

Content: I gave up on the dude. I kept thinking to myself Ron White had a point...you can't fix stupid and some of the stuff he was saying was rather stupid.

To be honest, there are a lot who get it with the whole argument who are Republican and I always suggest people look at their arguments before trying to talk to the ones who are on the fence. A good one I always look for for this is Reed Galen who is one of the guys behind the Lincoln Project and he currently is the one behind its spin-off, Join The Union. I've been on Zoom calls with this man and he really knows his stuff. He also has a really great Substack if anyone's interested. https://reedgalen.substack.com/

Content: Hi everyone, I was curious if there are any comprehensive master-docs hyperlinked with reputable  sources/stats outlining failures and flawed logic of Trump/republican policies? Particularly economically? Many Americans in socioeconomic groups that republican policy historically harms are convinced Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúeconomic superiority‚Äù justifies everything else. 

I‚Äôm hoping to find a database of resources similar to this document created by an activist in 2020, but haven‚Äôt found anything similar that‚Äôs more relevant to the 2024 election: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/e/2PACX-1vQu3FFQnKObUTmABEnw-s1TKYH9-9tpKXQoQYHAS-QjNiGcTE3vow42a99FXNi_ZoC0Q6gM9LfxasCe/pub?pli=1

Content: Hi Paige - I don't have a single document. I rely a lot on Steve Rattner's comparisons of Trump v Biden on the economy https://nyti.ms/3yq37LR .  You can see him on MSNBC with explanations of his charts https://youtu.be/HKrcTQ6JA04  and charts on his twitter site https://x.com/SteveRattner Elon Musk has pushed the idea that inflation comes from Fed spending, rather than corporate greed and high gas prices [not in control of Pres.]  etc. Here is tweet I've sent: ‚ÄúBiden has delivered an impressive recovery.‚Äù Biden was better than Trump on economic growth, manufacturing, home prices, new businesses, health insurance, child poverty & federal debt. Jobs increased more under Biden, even adjusting for pandemic effects.  https://wapo.st/4cZ7QTT https://nyti.ms/3yq37LR  Trump backers who got him elected believed his falsehood that tariffs would bring jobs back from overseas. They still don't know that tariffs cost each family thousands. Trump plans high tariffs again & Moody's & Nobel economists show how that would raise inflation & cost jobs,

Content: Yes, the page numbers reference the page number on the bottom of each page in the original Project 2025 PDF. If you click on them on a desktop, it will open the PDF directly to that page. Unfortunately mobile doesn't support that, so it will download the PDF and then you need to manually get to the page.

Content: Hey, can anyone provide details about how the virtual DNC watch parties work? Will people have the ability to live chat in the room they are in while watching? Will the link stream the DNC right in the watch party website, or does everyone have to use a different tab like YouTube to actually watch the DNC content? Also what specific days and times are most important to watch? I am organizing for a group of friends/community that are leftist leaning and considering not voting for anyone as a political statement. They are persuadable but it would help to have some suggested specific phrasings of talking points

Content: In answer to today's icebreaker, I'm looking forward to the Biden speech, just because it will be unusual, from a historical perspective.  But other than that, I really don't especially want to hear from all the OG's. Bill and Hillary Clinton. Meh. I would much rather hear Pete Buttegieg and Josh Shapiro and more from the younger more refreshing Democratic talent.

Content: Thanks Roby! Great job putting this immigration info together! Here is an article that makes some of the same points https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/fact-checker-trump-harris-ads/  . I've worked on messaging about Kamala's role in reducing the underlying causes of migration from El Salvador, Honduras & Guatemala.  I relied on two articles  https://wapo.st/3ABKjtI   https://ampr.gs/3WNFHIt    & the White House report of the plan she worked on https://bit.ly/46SZmeA Here is my summary that can be used for messaging [comments & suggestions welcome]:  Contrary to reports that Kamala Harris was in charge of border enforcement, she was assigned to work with 3 Central American countries, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, to reduce the underlying causes of migration to the U.S.  Migrants make the tough choice to leave their homes & homeland  & head to the U.S. in order to escape extreme poverty, gang violence & corruption. 
She helped send more $4 billion in U.S. aid to those countries, including COVID vaccines. She obtained the involvement of over 50 companies that have invested  $5.2 billion & created more than 70,000 jobs. Columbia Sportswear, Nespresso, auto-parts manufacturer Yazaki North America Inc., & others created thousands of factory & farming jobs.
Her efforts were stymied by entrenched gang violence & corruption. Nonetheless, migration from the 3 countries during the Biden administration has fallen 35 percent, to a level lower than it was in 2019 under Trump. While encouraging, it‚Äôs hard to know for sure if her work on these long-term solutions helped cause this decline. ‚Äì Dan S

Content: DNC Speaker Choice [sorry to be hogging the channel today]. Here in Michigan, 100,00 .voted 'uncommitted' in Feb. Some remain in the 'No Ceasefire, No Vote' movement. Here is someone I would be most excited to hear at the DNC:  Assad I. Turfe, the deputy Wayne County executive, who is the highest ranking Arab American official in Michigan‚Äôs largest county. said, ‚ÄúKamala Harris embodies the America we deserve ‚Äì an America that stands for strength, inclusivity and unwavering commitment to justice,‚Äù  ‚ÄúI wholeheartedly endorse Kamala Harris, as she represents the true spirit of our nation and the values we hold dear.‚Äù Turfe also pressed the need for a ceasefire, but said that Harris ‚Äúgives us the best chance of achieving peace in that region moving forward.‚Äù  Please get his statement to Michiganders if you can! https://bit.ly/4djpmCl

Content: Thank you for sharing the Mayorkas information. 600k unauthorized entries. Yes, lots of people continue to confuse encounters with arrests. Some intentionally for disinformation purposes. But many are truly confused about it. Here's ProPublica last June: ‚Äúit‚Äôs estimated that there is going to be between 1.6 to 1.7 million arrests. The high-water mark was 1.6 million in 2000 for the longest time. When the numbers went up in 2022 and 2023 to 2.2 million.‚Äù https://www.propublica.org/article/us-immigration-policy-2024-mexico

Content: Hi -- A terrific article came out yesterday on Kamala's work on immigration as CA AG: "Kamala Harris learned a lesson about the border early in her career. It‚Äôs paying off now - As California attorney general, Harris found common cause with law enforcement in cracking down on transnational gangs" - Blake Jones, 08/17/2024 https://politi.co/4fM4TIb   I learned a lot! e.g., she had Republican DA's support and police support.  Attached are a few paragraphs of article excerpts. Also Kamala is blasted for supporting "sanctuary" cities when in CA. Attached is some messaging with scientific references.

Content: You could look at their profile, if its empty/unnatural looking its a good indicator of an astroturfing account. If they have followers/friends, but those people‚Äôs accounts are also empty or fake-looking, that could be another sign.

It‚Äôs fairly trivial to generate an AI image for a profile photo, but generated images sometimes have errors and discrepancies.

Although astroturfing with bot accounts is getting more and more sophisticated, so it could be hard to tell for sure. If someone is acting like a bot, human or not, it‚Äôs probably just best to disengage since they are fully absorbed in their own messaging and probably not likely to re-evaluate anything.

Content: Important message and alert to everyone:   Lot of MAGA are on TikTok doing lives but they claim as Independents.  But, support Trump on every point and defend him like crazy.  This needs to be spread among democratic party and be alert to handle them.

Content: I'm a convention junkie. Have been since I watched my first, when Eisenhower was nominated. It was more fun back then because we weren't sure who would be the nominee until the roll was called. My favorite parts now are the young speakers and others who are not in politics, like the Khans.

Content: Thank you Dan for your detailed reply. The clarification of the "border czar" monicker is necessary. Working on countering the disinformation on border crossings is paramount. ProPublica confused "border encounters" with "arrests" in a report from last June. Even President Biden,
 in his speech last night said, ‚ÄúAs a result of the executive action I took, border encounters have dropped over 50%. In fact, there are fewer border crossings today than when Donald Trump left office.‚Äù Not necessarily misinformation, but confounding ‚Äúborder encounters‚Äù with ‚Äúborder crossings.‚Äù I have added these examples to the pdf, as well as the following "emotional summary:" It is straightforward. The yearly unauthorized entries at the border are about 1/2 a million. Meanwhile, about a million people overstay their authorized entry into the US. Another 1/2 a million people become legal residents in the US because of family ties. The number of ‚Äúencounters‚Äù last year was 2 and a half million, but encounters are not unauthorized entries into the country! No one talks about Spanish tourists being a problem, one of the worst groups overstaying their visas, or the many US citizens' family members who become legal residents too easily. But there is an outcry about the inflated number of poor brown people risking their lives to cross the desert to sustain the American economy. Why? Because disinformation about a border invasion creates fear and uncertainty and ultimately votes for anyone promising to fix the non-existing problem. Thanks again. Hope we can counter the disinformation on the issue!

Content: It's so hard to pick just one favorite moment from night 1.  I loved all the speeches.  The Reproductive Rights segment was so powerful.  And when Joe got mad and said "Who the HELL does he think he is?!" about Trump was amazing.

Content: Senator Warnock's speech last night was an important statement of where we should all stand. Not voting isn't a political statement, a third of the eligible population did not vote in 2016 - how did that help our country? Politicians listen to voters.

Content: I agree there were so many uplifting just plain wonderful moments. Hillary's speech, especially the part about telling her grandchildren "I was here!" AOC, of course! I loved the union support, cried at the abortion horror stories and really liked the mayors, so many smart, eloquent and strong women. But, for me, the moments that touched my heart profoundly were when the camera went to Kamala and we could see on her face the emotions she was feeling.  She is so real, beautiful  outside and inside. And then there was the final moment when she and Joe touched each other and looked at each other and had a private conversation. Whatever the words were we didn't need to hear. It was all again on their faces, the love, the respect, the shared sadness at his going and the joy of her starting.

Content: Damage, indeed! I think there is "Trump amnesia syndrome" in the country as whole --- and not surprising really from what we know about common responses to trauma. There's tremendous research on Trump's inaction & misinformation causing hundreds of thousands of covid deaths: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2021/02/11/trumps-policies-resulted-in-the-unnecessary-deaths-of-hundreds-of-thousands-of-americans-lancet-report/   https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-misinformation.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EU4.RhJQ.sN9XpwdTjaEf&smid=url-share https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10684792/ He conjectured about "injecting" bleach [not "ingesting" as many claim], but people DID ingest bleach after his comment https://www.poison.med.wayne.edu/updates-content/kstytapp2qfstf0pkacdxmz943u1hs -- Have been posting this info on twitter today to correct falsehoods.

Content: Am always inspired by the young woman who got pregnant by her step-dad at 12 -- and I know she'll be a voice for others who went through her form of hell AND face a greater hell from abortion bans. Got lots of energy from the women on fire- AOC & Hillary. I tweeted in real time during DNC as right wingers posted clips & comments within seconds. I monitor: End Wokeness, MAGA War Room, RNC Research, Trump War Room, Collin Rugg & Heritage Foundation.  One post had clips of UAW Pres taking off jacket to reveal Trump Is a Scab & then Hulk Hogan ripping off his shirt at RNC, with the question: "DNC vs RNC. Choose your fighter." I replied "Sure, that's easy, I'll choose the one fighting for workers every day, and not the one who thinks ripping off his shirt makes him a real man."  üòé

Content: All of the speakers were amazing!  Biden's really got to me. When they were chanting 'We love Joe' they really showed him the love. I bet he's never had that happen in 50 years but now people are paying closer attention to our politics and representatives because we can't have a democracy on autopilot anymore. When he teared up I felt that. Very genuine.

Content: Okay, everyone, I'll be on all evening. Convention night two...we get the ceremonial role call for Kamala as VP nominee. This should be exciting.

üßäToday‚Äôs Icebreaker üßä
What was your favorite moment from the convention last night?

Can we all agree that Jasmine Crockett with that whole thing about the resume and rap sheet was on point? Also, as a PA resident, you know I loved seeing Lt. Governor Austin Davis on that stage last night.

Content: I think a recurring theme/objection we will hear about Harris, is Inflation. I think it is important to put Inflation into perspective. In late 2021, 2022, everyone was expecting a recession. Flash foward to where we are today, it seems the recession has been avoided, and inflation is closer to being in check. 

Here is a timeline of related events.

**2021:**
Strong post-pandemic recovery but supply chain disruptions arise.
Inflation begins rising, initially seen as "transitory."
Fed signals tapering of bond-buying as inflation persists.

**2022:**
Russia-Ukraine war escalates inflation due to energy and food supply disruptions.
Fed and other central banks begin aggressive interest rate hikes.
Recession fears grow as yield curve inverts, signaling potential economic slowdown.
Mixed economic signals with slowing growth but resilient labor market.

**2023:**
Recession predictions emerge, but data is mixed; strong labor market persists.
Hopes for a "soft landing" increase as inflation eases slightly.
Fed moderates rate hikes to avoid a severe recession.
Global economic risks continue, but severe recession seems less likely.

**2024:**
Debate over mild recession vs. economic slowdown continues.
Central banks consider pausing rate hikes to balance inflation control and economic stability.

Currently seems like we're on track for a "soft landing"
Biden: We're going to have a soft landing on inflation

Monthly U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) development 1973-2024
Published by 
Raynor de Best
, Aug 1, 2024
The US dollar index of the summer of 2023 was lower than that of the second half of 2022, although it was still relatively high compared to previous years. The index ‚Äì often referred to with the code DXY, or USDX ‚Äì measures the value of the U.S. dollars compared to six other foreign currencies at the same time. These include the euro, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, and the Swedish kr√≥na. It originated in 1973, with the arrival of the petrodollar and the dissolution of the Bretton Woods Agreement. As the index has only been updated once ‚Äì when the euro arrived in 1999 ‚Äì some argue this composition is not accurate to the current state of the world. The price development of the U.S. dollar affects many things, including commodity prices in general.

"We‚Äôre from Jersey, baby ‚Äì and you‚Äôre not! In the great Garden State, we care about protecting women‚Äôs rights and lifting up vulnerable communities. That‚Äôs what we mean when we say the great Garden State.‚Äù

Americans want the hope of giving birth through IVF not the fear it might be taken away. Americans with LGBTQ kids don‚Äôt want them facing crimination at school because the state sanctioned it. Americans want to go to their neighborhood grocery store and not have to worry about some random guy open carrying an AR-15.

Content: I loved all the speeches!! Laughing again today at Barack's joke about Walz: "I love this guy. Tim‚Äôs the kind of person who should be in politics ‚Äî somebody who was born in a small town, served his country, taught kids, coached football, and took care of his neighbors. He knows who he is and what‚Äôs important. You can tell those flannel shirts he wears don‚Äôt come from some consultant, they come from his closet, and they‚Äôve been through some stuff." MAGA is going bonkers nuts about the humor, joy & women who laugh. Pushing back on twitter on the notion that Kamala is a secret Nazi because she has a slogan "Strength Through Joy" [not true], which was the name of the Nazi "workers' rights" movement. Our humor & joy is a winning way -- see attached piece by evidence-based messaging guru Anat Shenker-Osorio

Content: Good lord, people blame every bad thing that insurance companies do on the ACA instead of understanding that the ACA was meant to protect us from insurance companies. It actually succeeds at doing so in a big way for women, as well as people in poverty and people with disabilities and preexisting conditions like diabetes and asthma!

Content: From my time online I've found that it can often be important to just accept that the person you're talking to is too far gone. A decent percentage of the online right is at a point where they simply cannot be convinced otherwise. They have thought terminating cliches and memes they use to avoid actually engaging with you. They claim that any evidence against their points is either fake, wrong, or misinterpreted.

They've stopped believing the things they do because of logic. And you can't logic someone out of an argument they didn't logic themselves into.

Content: Hi Jim - Several reports are like this one from Newsweek: "Netanyahu's office denied that the call took place. In a statement quoted by The Times of Israel, a spokesperson said: "Contrary to media reports, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not speak yesterday with former President Trump"". Reports are contradictory on what Trump said, if anything. Some say he supported the ceasefire and some say the opposite  "Axios cited one source as saying that Trump's alleged call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the ceasefire deal that was on the table. However, the unnamed source told the outlet that they did not know what the actual conversation was." People might be referring to what Trump said to Prime Min. in July in FL: end the war fast [but did not mention of the ceasefire] https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248

Tim Walz said, ‚ÄúWe can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried (as a member of the military) COMMA in war is the only place those weapons are at.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say HE CARRIED A WEAPON IN WAR, he said, in war is the only place military weapons should be found. 

The only thing I‚Äôve heard from the campaign is that Gov. Walz ‚Äúmisspoke.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt. Republicans are mishearing. PLEASE address this issue, head-on.

Content: It's fair for them to characterize him as misspeaking there because his phrasing does leave room for confusion. But I agree that clarifying what he actually said, and what he meant by that, is important too.

Content: A couple things here (just in general - hopefully this is ok) 

1) Try as best you can not to become jaded by the encounters you may have that are negative or even frustrating. There are a lot of bots and spammers out there and the accounts blend pretty well so it may not really even be a US Voter. I've been an online moderator for almost 20 years and in that time you get an eye for bots etc as you will see trends in the "talking points" that get repeated almost verbatim. Also, sometimes its not about that specific person but the potential thousands that may read their comments and never say a word. You may not reach that person, but you could reach someone else that is undecided or reading and sees your well reasoned points or appreciates the tone of your answers.

2) People are influenced quite often by online traffic/trends. So if things seem to flow online in one direction, then people assume that must be right and DJT has managed to control the narrative and direct it where he wants it to go well and to full effect. If you read something enough times, you assume its true and I think he relies on people having zero time to look all this up and trusting on faith. IMHO he is abusing their trust. 

3) I find that sometimes asking questions is the best way to go in cases like that. Ask why they feel as they do or for more information on their views. If its a bot, they tend to stop replying or engaging and if its a person then you tend to show interest and the convo may go different and worst case scenario, anyone reading sees you are showing interest/care.

That said, always good to know when to say when (I sometimes admit to failing miserably on this so definitely easier said than done) but do the best you can. (PS Also feel free to completely ignore me too. I've never volunteered ever so not an expert on this by any means - just talking from my general work experience.) No matter what, only ever engage anyone as much as you feel comfortable. Its best for your own mental health. (Just as a general rule of online)

Content: Again, speakers last night gave speeches of a lifetime! Loved them! I am focused right now on the Israel-Hamas war & what's happening at DNC. In Michigan, 100,000 voted uncommitted in Feb & many have not committed to vote in Nov.  Here is the DNC speech by the parents of hostage Hersh Polin https://x.com/martinlieberman/status/1826411913741226016 In interview today on MSNBC [clip not posted yet], they said the hostage return now depends on the Hamas leader & Bibi. [Kamala was on the call this wk between Biden & Bibi - have not looked at read out] The parents expected  a neutral or hostile response from DNC but the love they got moved them to tears. I'll send later my doc on Kamala's positions, & progressives & resisters' responses & some talking points. Here is how the MI Demcast leader responded to DNC sit-in https://x.com/WhitchMI/status/1826456122355585128 Many still affected by AOC's April interview https://www.thewrap.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-biden-gaza-war/

Content: I've been enjoying the convention so far. The speeches have been good especially Jaime Raskin, AOC, Hilary Clinton and Bill did well too. Of course Michelle and Barak Obama. They're always good speech makers. Biden's was ok and Tim Walz's was very similar to his stump speech so I wished he'd said a few different things but all the same, his was short and sweet.

I like the energy and the Roll Call house party is the way to do it going forward

Content: I have been wondering why Trump meeting with Netanyahu and Orban at Mar-A-Lago is not the same violation. Trump is not a member of the government. Is it because it specifically refers to 'influencing disputes'?

Tim and Gwen and their two kids are what the promise of America really is. They are  citizen politicians. Not big money, not Corporate influence, not party darlings - just regular people trying to make the lives of others better.

Content: Can I just report that the dissent that I see online is about a couple of things: 1. Gaza...people think a Palestinian American should be allowed to speak at the convention. 2. Big business...lots of reports that Harris' staff is courting big business including Dimon for Treasury, per some news reports.  I don't know how to respond as these are progressives but highly critical. I suspect some of them just want to be angry.

Content: Interesting ... I grew up 9 miles from the largest Muslim community (Dearborn, MI) in the USA and most of them understand the difference to their issues between Trump and Harris.  They overwhelming support the latter.  To the others I would reinforce that under Trump there was a Muslim ban and he unequivacally supports the thug Netanyahu (birds of a feather).  Under Harris you have a path to persue your cause.

Content: Here is an excerpt from an August 7 PBS interview with the Mayor of Dearborn, MI

Amna Nawaz:

Mr. Mayor, as you have seen, amid all the discontent, the frustration with the Biden administration's policy in Israel and towards Gaza, we have seen the Trump team conducting a lot of outreach in Michigan.

We know his former Cabinet official Richard Grenell, for example, has been on the ground and others. Is any of that outreach working? Is there an opportunity there for the Trump/Vance ticket?

Abdullah Hammoud: (mayor of Dearborn MI)

There is no opportunity whatsoever.

They have certainly reached out to some members, but the individuals they have spoken with don't represent or speak on behalf of the community in any regard. I can tell you that nobody who I have spoken with, even some of the conservative constituents that I represent, have also expressed great disdain for the Trump/Vance ticket, because they understand what a Trump presidency represents.

This is an individual who is vocal about wanting to bring back a Muslim ban in new fashion and new order. This is the president who moved the embassy to Jerusalem, who eliminated all humanitarian aid relief toward Palestinians in the budget that he passed during his time.

This is somebody that recognized the annexation of the Golan Heights and the annexation of illegal settlements. This is somebody that armed Saudi Arabia that killed 30,000 people in Yemen. And so we very much understand what Trump represents as a president and that is not something anybody wants to see this November.

Content: Some of the protestors are not and will likely never be democrats, and are instead part of the ‚Äòfar left‚Äô (for lack of a better term). Though it is a very small and splintered segment of people, there are people who identify as various kinds of socialists and communists and who cluster in various overlapping ways around political parties like the Worker‚Äôs World Party, but also the Democratic Socialists of America. These groups are extremely rigid, and to remain in them one has to adhere to certain positions. AOC, for example, was backed by the DSA, who have now washed their hands of her (in a dumb move on their part) because she wouldn‚Äôt refer to the situation in Gaza as ‚Äògenocide‚Äô.

I‚Äôll only comment now specifically to the WWP and that mentality because I used to affiliate with them in 2002-2003 when I lived in DC. The WWP uses hot-button issues like Gaza to recruit activists and then proceeds to radicalize the activists around a revolutionary socialist agenda. In my day they used the War in Iraq and those huge rallies we had to try and prevent the war were organized in part by the activist front groups of the WWP. Not that a large percentage of the people protesting knew that or would have cared. We were all sincerely against the war. Just‚Ä¶ the difference between liberal democratic resistance and the far left resistance to the War in Iraq was one of persuading people to start voting democratic and support anti-war democratic candidates in primaries and generals. In the far left circles I used to move in, we saw both political parties as faces of capitalism and the main goal was to work to overthrow capitalism and use anti-war sentiment to radicalize people for that purpose. 

It sounds way out there. But it‚Äôs true. We had public activist meetings where leaders from the WWP regularly spoke and over time slowly amped up the anti-capitalist rhetoric. Meanwhile, behind the scenes for folks like me who were already essentially old school communists, we had reading groups and read things like *The State and Revolution* by Lenin, or stuff from Trotsky, and we‚Äôd strategize around the longer term goal of anti-capitalism.

The WWP is still around and one can go to their website. They are doing the same thing with Gaza that they did with the Iraq War. 

Many protesters, I assume, are not ‚Äòhard left‚Äô like this, and those who aren‚Äôt will, I strongly suspect, will come home. Those who are hard left kinda need to be dealt with the same one would engage MAGAists‚Ä¶

For me‚Ä¶ I ‚Äòleft‚Äô the Democratic party in the late 90s, but then I came back in 2008, then truly came back (changed my registration from I to D) in 2016. Obama, then Bernie + the Clinton general election campaign brought me back.

In short. Don‚Äôt sweat the pro-palestinian protestors. I hope Harris/Walz address it, but I trust their judgment.

Content: I suspect I am bumping into some of the far left "anti-capitalist/socialist/communist" folks online. Engaging with them is not recommended. But they are the most vocal in many online communities. I hope the campaign finds a way to acknowledge those who are sincere about the issue. The people who honestly care just want to be seen.

Content: Thanks Dan ... for people who are not engaged but bring this up, I use the short response I gave to CarolC.  Michigan has come a long way -- so proud!  We have to stay postive and emphasize the common sense, decency, and dignity route to solving our problems.  I feel so good about our future if Harris and Walz wins.  We can accomplish anything if we do it together.  Unfortunely there will always be those we can't reach, but they are getting fewer and fewer with Harris/Walz!

Content: I‚Äôm glad to be back. In 2008 I donated for the first time to political campaigns (Obama and several senate campaigns plus the DCCC). Bernie‚Äôs first primary run and everything after convinced me that there was room for Western European style democratic socialism in the democratic party (so like what our center left and left leaning parties are like here in the Netherlands). So I changed my registration so I can participate in Democratic primaries.

This is the first campaign where I‚Äôm volunteering too. It won‚Äôt be a lot of time I can give, but I‚Äôm giving some‚Äîand gladly!

Content: On the topic of "stolen valor"-- can we get an infographic with Trump's quote from his Asheboro rally:

Talking about his plan to create the largest peacetime Recruitment and Retention drive:

"We're gonna make it so hot that I'm gonna want to resign and join the military. I don't know what rank I'd start at. I guess I'd start at Private. I don't know. What rank would I have to start at General? I have to start pretty low. He said you'll start at the top. All right then I'll stay in. That's very good."

Content: Hi Caroline - Thanks for the full interview! A part of it shows how empathy & support for resisters helps to bring them on board, as the mayor said: "it was the first time in a long time that me and the community felt an individual such as the vice president humanized Palestinians, recognized the suffering and even brought forth that Palestinians deserve the right to self-determination.  And then, most recently, as we have also seen with her V.P. pick with . . . this is a governor who may be the only governor in the country who when the uncommitted vote sprung up in his state as well, he congratulated the uncommitted voters.  . . .And he recognized the situation in Gaza is intolerable, that the party should be listening & . . . that we should course-correct  . . "  Your message to activists is very positive & reassuring --  I want to keep reaching out. Am concerned that if  20,000 of the 100,000 stay home, which is progress, it could still make Trump president. So I start with deep empathy & our common ground with resisters -- 'My heart breaks also at the deaths of Palestinians & the destruction of Gaza. I fear every day I'll see more bodies, men, women and babies. I have deep, deep anger & sadness that I also sense in you. I hope every day our demands for a ceasefire & humanitarian aid are met - NOW.  War crimes have been committed by Israel from the start.   I want to keep my power with a president I can influence so I'll vote for Kamala - with her, we will live in democracy, not dictatorship"  I know people who've gone from not voting to a vote for Harris by listening to AOC : ‚ÄúI would rather, even in places of stark disagreement, I would rather be organizing under the conditions of Biden as an opponent on an issue than Trump, who is not‚Ä¶ he seeks to dismantle American democracy.‚Äù Under Trump "we will not be able to organize for any movement towards anything if we are facing the jailing of dissidents.

Content: Hello my fellow online engagers! Been building my repertoire of Facebook groups, trying to observe how they operate and what sort of engagement would be the best for that particular group! Don't want to overwhelm myself or others, and also stay on topic as to not get kicked. Worked on a community map, to narrow in where I think I would garner the most support. As always, trying to educate about where we're standing in history and combat misinformation across apps. So excited to join in on night 4 of the DNC tonight, I CANNOT wait to hear what VP Kamala Harris has to say, and I hear rumors of a surprise guest celebrity appearance!

I was interviewed and featured in a Swiss newspaper with my prediction that Obama would win!  üôÇ   Living over there was eye-opener.  We could learn a lot from them.

Content: Hi friends! Asking for help on FB Group Descriptions and Rules sections--In the Indiana chat we decided to create Hoosiers for Harris and I recently created a FB Group for it. I'm looking around examples of other groups I am in and I might just ask ChatGPT to help me draft it as well, but does anyone have any "must haves" that they might have included in their own groups that have been beneficial in creating a respectful and enjoyable FB space? Looking forward to your thoughts, thanks in advance!!

Content: Hi Malik - First, it's difficult for any president to influence inflation, and a major underlying factor - gas prices.  [this is not effective message], second Biden/Harris have done a LOT to control inflation-- and the rate of inflation is down last few month & wages have grown at a higher rate for a while. In the attached see how investment in child & elder care reduce inflation.  Third, Kamala will go a step further than Biden for example to fight corporate greed that is a major inflation driver.   See the summary of her recent speech -- she will have more detailed plans soon  https://www.epi.org/blog/debunking-5-top-inflation-myths/ https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/kamala-harris-economy.html

Content: I'm glad to see Harris/Walz adding incentives to the building side, not just subsidizing demand. There's def a segment of disaffected urbanists this will help inspire -- I look forward to seeing if we can push these platform points out via the YIMBY social circuit.

Content: Esp with how presumed rent factors into CPI (and thus inflation), some supply side subsidization that breaks rental cost upticks should make the top line numbers (as well as peoples' subjective experience!) a lot better.

But also -- any tax breaks available at the federal level are still valid incentives.

Content: Is it possible to get ads like this one being shown at the dnc so that we don‚Äôt have to post them from Twitter? I haven‚Äôt been able to find any of the dnc ads on reach but somehow people on Twitter are finding them. https://x.com/pettylupone/status/1826752612685021671?s=46&t=gTT_zOWWOS9U3RWfKyB6rQ

Content: It‚Äôs too bad because the content is perfect for touting democrats‚Äô and Harris‚Äôs accomplishments, which is exactly what undecided voters would want to see. I will share on Twitter and other ways as much as I can.

Content: Many ads are distributed only in swing states, so their voters see ads first.  If you're on the campaign's email list though, their emails are linking ads that aren't public on YouTube (I don't know why they're not public and not on Reach.)

Content: My state's channel was unaware there was even a FB Group, which is why we went ahead and created one without knowing there was already a group made. But I guess what I had in mind was having a big IN group, separate chats for counties, and then the party or precinct people could coordinate with nearby towns or counties in those chats or the big group overall in case they wanted to do joint events for something. Or gather students to volunteer on college campuses. Do you know if they do similar things for your state's FB group(s)?

I also want a great clip of VP Harris with that stern ‚Äúprosecutor‚Äù face - making the case!  Most importantly, we desperately need video messages that speak to rural and ‚Äúrust belt‚Äù communities!!!  We want to include everyone - leaving no one behind!  Thank you!

Content: Hi - I check with YouTube to see if speeches are there. If I want clips I use Realplayer or other software. If the speech is on C-Span they have a clipping feature. For rural voters there is none better than Tim Walz --  the coach who worked on grandparents farm in summer. Go beyond his speeches to include photos like the one in tee shirt holding a pig & the video of him with daughter at state fair.  Short policy statements can be added. I found Gov Shapiro''s full speech in seconds and guess others will be there too May your work be filled with joy & laughter .https://youtu.be/HZRXjOBeJIA

Content: I'm Gen X and I haven't felt this amount of hopefulness since Obama...and back then it wasn't even nearly as dark. The contrast between 2008 and how Bush handled the transition of power vs J6. That contrast makes the choice for Harris and Walz shines even brighter.

Content: Yesterday, Trump invited the loved ones of murder victims to speak out near the border. He's in AZ and NV today, probably with similar message. Here is a version of a reply I sent last night with the best studies I could find. "Murders by undocumented immigrants are heartbreaking tragedies. Victims‚Äô loved ones need much support & perpetrators must be held accountable. Fortunately, such murders are very rare &  undocumented persons murder at a lower rate than those born in the U.S. Also, immigration is not tied to terrorism. A study of all 50 states found that an increase in undocumented immigration over 14 years was NOT linked to terrorist attacks, radicalization, or terrorism prosecutions." https://bit.ly/4diXQ7H https://bit.ly/3WGnKf7 https://bit.ly/3U5eC3g

Content: Hello all! A little about myself: I learned how to work the Twitter algorithm this year and I currently run a Twitter account with 16m impressions. I spend most of my day on Twitter while I work my full time job and go to school full time as well for Sociology. I attempt to use compassion and tact to pacify the verbal violence I encounter and my ultimate goal is to decrease the toxicity from the gaming community that led me down this path. MAGA abuse is my focus currently.

If anybody needs any Twitter tips, feel free to message~

What don't I do? I mean, I do OE, I'm on text team, I'm a facilitator for Vote Team, I mod on Discord, I work with one grassroots organization on voter registration and I'm on the foundation board for two more.  What I don't do? It seems I don't sleep.

Content: He demonizes migrants because of his stupidity. 45 thinks that people ‚Äúseeking asylum‚Äù are coming here from other country‚Äôs ‚Äúinsane asylums‚Äù. He is THAT vapid, to not know the difference. It is why he tells the Hannibal Lecter story. He is equating cannibalism and insane people from ‚Äúasylums‚Äù.

Content: There's so much to unpack here. Also, to use illegals as a reason for the issues today is just a modern day form of scapegoating if anyone thinks about it. Another thing to think about is this: In a lot of cities, violent crime is going down. For instance, I saw a report on the local news here that said that homiacides in Philadelphia have decreased in the last year. What was that thing four years ago about "bad things happening" in Philadelphia that Trump said about? UGH!

Content: Reddit seems to be suppressing this. Gotta get it voted up and talk about how RFK was always Trump...funded by Trump loyalists.

Content: Hi DJ - "illegal human being" --yes,  not your grandfather & not anyone else! Amen! Sad to hear yuou had a Trumper go ballistic on you [and congratulations on going 20 minutes üòé ] Glad to see this discussion on migrants. Have been learning that autocrats -- Mussolini, Hitler, Orban, Trump -- use fear of migrants as winning message -- and now even many democrats are turning against immigrants. MAGA also bash "sanctuary cities".  Here is one way I have posted on them: "SANCTUARY CITIES ARE SAFE Trump continues to rail against ‚Äúsanctuary cities.‚Äù His Agenda 47 will block federal grants to them. Yet, ‚Äúsanctuary communities‚Äù are as safe as other communities, with no difference in rates of violent crime, rape, or property crime. They are likely to decrease crime because immigrant victims are much more willing to call the police. They do NOT shield immigrants from deportation. Murders by undocumented immigrants are heartbreaking tragedies but, fortunately, are rare. Such murders in Houston, Athens, GA, Grand Rapids MI & Poweshiek County IA, were not in ‚Äòsanctuary‚Äô locations. https://bit.ly/4f2kFyl  https://bit.ly/4f7NjOs   https://bit.ly/3LXowPN

Content: Yes yes yes Thank you for this link. I will be posting! This really hits me hard. As the granddaughter of an immigrant and a descendent of the enslaved on both sides of my family. I am unusually emotional about this! Kamala has to win by a landslide. And we have to debunk the immigration demonization! White women don‚Äôt vote for Democrats because they have white men in their lives, telling them to fear US! We need to educate our white sisters!

Content: My parents immigrated to America from Vietnam, and then they had me. They sacrificed everything that they had to give me a better life and I couldn‚Äôt have been more thankful for them. They have worked super hard to achieve the American dream, have always paid their taxes and contributed to society in other ways. America is called a melting pot for a reason; whether you‚Äôre white, black, Asian, etc‚Ä¶ we are all human beings who just deserve to live in a country where we can be free to be ourselves with no hatred.

Content: When Trump was elected, I used photos of families coming north to US as a way to humanize them -- I sent them to Ivanka thinking she'd have more sympathy -- can't find those photos but am sure you all can find some good ones -- in the following message I try to humanize immigrants & describe Kamala's role: "Contrary to reports that Kamala Harris was in charge of border enforcement, she was assigned to work with 3 Central American countries, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, to reduce the underlying causes of migration to the U.S.  She built on her experience as a DA and Attorney General in California, where she worked closely with CA police & prosecutors & their Mexican counterparts to bring drug smugglers & human traffickers to justice.
Migrants make the tough choice to leave their homes & homeland to make the arduous & dangerous journey to the U.S. in order to escape extreme poverty, gang violence & corruption. 
Harris helped send more $4 billion in U.S. aid to those countries, including COVID vaccines. She obtained the involvement of over 50 companies that have invested $5.2 billion & created more than 70,000 jobs. Columbia Sportswear, Nespresso, auto-parts manufacturer Yazaki North America & others created thousands of factory & farming jobs.
Her efforts were stymied by entrenched gang violence & corruption. Nonetheless, migration from the 3 countries during the Biden-Harris administration has fallen 35 percent, to a level lower than it was in 2019 under Trump. While encouraging, it‚Äôs hard to know if her work on these long-term solutions helped produce this decline. https://wapo.st/3ABKjtI https://ampr.gs/3WNFHIt https://bit.ly/46SZmeA

Content: "Sure and I have swampland in New Jersey" always works for me but that's because I'm a Jersey girl by birth. For anyone else, I'd point out how Trump has had people connected to him who are a part of the group that authored it and how his Agenda 47 has a lot of what Project 2025 does. Also this photo is proof that Trump may claim to back down but he still has his fingerprints all over it. He's in this photo with the president of The Heritage Foundation which are the authors of Project 2025.

Content: I've built a following on @Threads called "Old White Women for Harris". It started as a joke, but when one post got 33K hits, stuff got serious. I post a few times a day, giving them tools to take action. Today I reminded them to plan to vote early so they could be available on election day to either volunteer or work the polls.

Content: I have a person reporting that there was a denial for a Palestinian American speaker at the DNC. The denial has caused the group, Muslim Women for Harris, to pull support?! I am not sure if this is true or how to handle this issue. The person wants an answer.

Content: Here is what I commented:
"As someone who also lived in the East Bay and also depended on chosen family for love and support for many years, hearing her name all the people there who helped raise her was really beautiful. I donated, and volunteered, and I'm going to volunteer more. This isn't just a campaign, it's a movement. Let's win this thing!"

Content: dont know if you've solved this but its also good to point out that trump is a habitual liar, and willing to continually do so if it gets him an electoral victory. he lied about stormy daniels, he lied about his father being arrested at a kkk rally, etc. he will do whatever it takes to get back into office. CNN has identified at least 140 former advisers from the Trump administration who are involved with Project 2025, including six of his former cabinet secretaries, 4 appointed ambassadors, and his chief of staff. these are the people trump has worked with and is working with for his presidency. what he says has little value over what he does. "talk is cheap", as the saying goes

Content: Yes, Thomas W E, I was on a phone bank today and reached someone who's whole family votes Democrat but this year they are so angry at Biden for supporting Israel that they will vote Republican. I pointed out that US military aid was only about 1/8 of the Israeli defense budget and that stopping that aid would make no difference. I also agreed with him that Netanyahu has to go but I fear that we have lost this family.

Content: The fact of the matter is - they are trying to hold the democrat party hostage in a situation where there are multiple ... nefarious actors, and multiple nations involved propping up a side. There is no easy solution. Pulling arms leads to more chaos. But a lot of people will not recognize that.

Content: One suggestion I havent see here yet is to tell people what our candidate, in particular, has to offer as a solution. Just saying that the other guy is worse is not a compelling argument for a lot of people and does not communicate to people what your candidates ideas actually are, just not what they are not.

Content: It's the Israeli extremists and Netanyahu who create this issue. American has been supporting Israel since we helped found it post WW2. Like James said above. It is complicated.

Content: Agreed, that would be my response‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry I did not make it clear. üò¨. ‚Äúan abusive father would never receive the love and admiration from his special needs child that Coach Walz received from Gus during his speech, that child would always be in fear and would only cower.‚Äù  I like what you said and think it would be great to add to that. ‚ÄúWhat I saw was a father, now after that speech,  who realizes he has to protect his son from the media at all costs.‚Äù

Content: Absolutely. We won't get them all. Don't be disheartened folks. I love my palestinian friends and wish for the best of the region. There will be some folks who sit this election out. Maybe even in key areas, but remember - basically 1/3rd of America didn't vote last election. Many many millions of those are in the center. To go to the left, we lose them completely. And for... sadly, sadly, a .05% of our population.

Content: Yes I just started downloading the assets to my phone to share.  It‚Äôs faster, I can download multiple & gives me more flexibility too with sharing with family & friends, multiple groups etc.   I am disappointed that we haven‚Äôt seen videos from Kamala‚Äôs speech and the other speakers from last night to share either.  Maybe they are having trouble too but the selection updates today have not been there

Content: Yeah that‚Äôs what I do‚Ä¶ just download.  I go in a couple-3 times a day and see if anything new to share, download it to my asset folder for use at some point  and then go back to sharing.  It just takes too much time not have it readily available if you are in a thread or conversation and have the opportunity to share it on the spot.

Content: also: BEACUSE she met with him she's being labeled a zionist a murderer a genocider, etc. Uncommitted really needs to take a step back and study Civil Rights history and strategies because what they brought to the DNC such as ultimatums they're not in a position to make, aren't going to help Palestinians.

Content: I wish Ruwa Romman would have been able to speak but who knows of the circumstances. The Tennesee Three (the two Justins and Gloria Johnson) were cut last-minute from the lineup. I was hoping Rep. Romman would have been put in the slot.

Content: I'm super late to the the Palestine conversation. I just wanted to throw in a vaguely educated response to why things are the way they are. Hi. I'm Evren. I have a master's degree in international affairs (foreign policy) from Pitt. I am NOT a middle east expert by any stretch, but I do know a few relevant things that people need to keep in mind. 

1. Foreign relationships are very complicated (as someone else said). We have treaties, agreements, and obligations that we have to honor unless we meet very VERY strict guidelines for doing otherwise. 

2. We have military bases in Israel. We will not just abandon them. This is a strategic ally when dealing with the Middle East. Be aware: Caliphates are not prone to human rights. At all. It is not a bad thing to keep an eye on things. Look up the Ottoman Empire. Muslims have overrun Europe before. DO NOT assume they are all keen to just keep to themselves. 

3. Mind you, they also kill LGBT folk in their own countries and even young adults that marry against their parents' wishes (honor killings). Muslims here are not the same as Muslims there in all cases (not trying to vilify "all" anyone, just this liberal bias towards Muslim protection will not be afforded to you necessarily). 

4. Civilian damage should absolutely be minimized in any war. There is no excuse for what BeBe has done here. He saw this as the perfect opportunity to wipe Palestinians out. He's a garbage extremist and so is some of his cabinet. We have to try to get a ceasefire deal. Period.

5. We are not able to "remove him" or take over. That is not however the world works. We cannot declare war or any such nonsense. Whether or not anyone thinks Israel should exist, it does (I am not a zionist, but I accept that this is where we are). We have to deal with it now as it is.

Content: speaking of online-engagement, I was SO frustrated with Uncommitted at the DNC. So many missteps. And online, especially TikTok, things exploded when MVP stared down the hecklers. I was going to say protesters, but that was just straight-up heckling. Next time, they'll know.

Content: Well put Thomas! I tried making that point a couple days ago [8-22 3:09 PM] - As you probably know, messaging gurus, such as those who teach deep canvassing, say we need to start with empathy & a search for common ground - there's a great video of David Hogg going to a gun range & how he built a relationship with a gun owner. Here is part of what I wrote: I want to keep reaching out. Am concerned that if  20,000 of the 100,000 stay home [in MI], which is progress, it could still make Trump president. So I start with deep empathy & our common ground with resisters -- 'My heart breaks also at the deaths of Palestinians & the destruction of Gaza. I fear every day I'll see more bodies, men, women and babies. I have deep, deep anger & sadness that I also sense in you. I hope every day our demands for a ceasefire & humanitarian aid are met - NOW.  War crimes have been committed by Israel from the start.   I want to keep my power with a president I can influence so I'll vote for Kamala - with her, we will live in democracy, not dictatorship"

Content: I'm so tired of the TikTok myopic bs. They latched onto this like a badge of honor as if there won't be equivalent deaths of women in our own country from a national abortion ban. One can be against war crime and against deaths of women at the same time.

Content: in this case though (e.g. online engagement and scapegoating Black voters), this is a longstanding issue of vote-suppression. Trying to get Black voters -in particular- to sit out a vote or shame us into not voting, etc. has a very long history in the US. Some of our precints STILL have to deal with 8-hour lines and violent conservative vigilantes patrolling polling places.

Content: We 100% need to stop the gerrymandering in favor of the right and have a fair system that has NOTHING to do with making 50/50 of a state when 20% of the voters buy their bs. We need enfranchisement of all voters, and good education for yt ones (yeah, I said it).

Content: point is, in this country, if you're Black, they would shoot to unalive you for trying to vote, will burn down your entire neighborhood for trying to vote, and put up all manner of legal and legislative barriers to stop you from voting. My parents were newlyweds in 1965. This is recent history for us.

Content: Hi Zuny -- here is the MSNBC interview with Ruwa Romman. She says she does not know why she was not allowed to speak. The speech did not call for an arms embargo & did not use the term "genocide". It included an endorsement of Harris. From what I know so far, really too bad she could not give the speech. https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/palestinian-american-lawmaker-denied-opportunity-to-speak-at-dnc-shares-what-she-would-ve-said-217900101846

Content: That's funny!  I will ask that too.  But I am also asking what will their life look like when Cheeto Jesus(I say Trump while talking to voters) makes drastic cuts to social security and takes away their healthcare and eliminates the ability to get overtime pay.  The impact to their quaity of life will be massive.  That is waking a lot of people up out of the trance.  I'll never forget the teacher in Wisconsin who was intererviewed after Scott Walker took away the right to collective bargaining for public workers.  She was a religious fundamentalist who had voted on only one issue - abortion.  She did not consider that she would lose the only pathway for wage increases and wage equality and her bottom line was, in the end, the most important issue to her.  Many people will be poorer if Trump wins.

Content: Glad there was a good discussion but we must focus on the fact that there are only Muslim bans and solidarity with Netanyahu on the Republican side -- Obeidallah, Mehdi and Velshi all agree that the choice is clear that we must elect Kamala and now let's pour 100% of our energy into getting that done.

Content: I'm having good luck contacting old friends on linkedin.  This is a platform that was well-used in the St. Louis area where I spent a good part of my career.  I use social media to set up personal contact to do solid ASKS for the campaign.  I'm also enjoying checking in with old friends.  I like relational organizing in the digital space and face-to-face because we can move people into this campaign.  It's ALL HANDS ON DECK.  No time for policy discussions leading no where.  Now, it's finding our PEEPS and getting them into action for Kamala, Tim and other dems.

Content: My 2 posts of supporters and the plane at the Detroit rally was reported to FB as false info twice. I was also reported for "fraud & trying to take $" for replying Thank you! to Gretchen Whitmer's post about free community college. So now my account is at risk, can't get it to work, and not sure what to do about that.

Content: Hey all! I found this old psa from 1947 and it feels very relevant to current events, especially project 2025, and might be helpful in starting conversations with potential voters, friends and family. TW: the video does contain topics of fascism and ww2 and some outdated language, it's not very graphic but please be advised when watching. https://youtu.be/vGAqYNFQdZ4?si=pRKfFa0qpzar9b2-

Content: At first, this may sound far fetched, but how about consulting primary sources? You don't have to believe what someone wrote about Kamala's speech--go listen to the speech yourself on YouTube. Want to know what Congress is up to? Look at current legislative activities at congress.gov  . Election results are published online by each Town Clerk (or at least they are in MA). Etc. Etc. I realize this isn't always a practical strategy, but if there's an issue you care about, you can usually find a primary source.

Content: I am going to say, ouch and was it really hers to do want whatever she wanted to do with it until we, had you? We have never been stronger divided. It takes us all together working as one. The goals of the other side have always been to drive us apart. I could have never expected to spark such an amazing respond to this difficult subject for us all to bear. You have all been amazing in helping me understand so much more clearly. I do apologize for my internet speed. I do try my very best to keep up. From what I understand, Ruwa Romman was not the only speaker that was cut from the timeline. Thank you. I think they overbooked because no one could possibly anticipate the incredible response the Harris Walz team would bring. But it is just one small opinion. Thank you, so much for your help. üíô

Content: Does anyone have tips for organizing who you follow on IG? I'm middle-aged lol so my social media peaks at Twitter and Facebook. I feel like it's easier to find like-mindeds on Twitter because you can search by hashtag etc. but IG I basically find myself clicking on the comments and following accounts that seem Dem-leaning. It's so much easier to do this on Twitter IMO but I feel IG may be more important! Idk. Anyone have any tips?

Content: I hope when Kamala Harris gives her first sit down interview it isn't with someone like Dana Bash, Jake Tapper, Jim Acosta, Lester Holt, George Stephanopolous. 
These people all participated in attacking President Biden CONSTANTLY for weeks. While they gave Dumpty Trumpty a total pass for all his lies & complete insanity! They give him free media, just like they did in 2016, to rant. Whatever these things are they ARE NOT press conferences or interviews!
If Trump gets back in it's going to be because our mainstream media treated him as if he's just a normal candidate when they KNOW he is not!
I would like to recommend that she do her first sit down interview with Ben Meisalas of the MeidasTouch Network. Almost 3 million people now subscribe to that channel & that's where we get our news. It is NOT a Democrat or Republican or left or right wing outlet. MeidasTouch is THE PRO-DEMOCRACY NETWORK! 
I'm quite sure Ben would do a fair, respectful interview.  He has interviewed President Biden in the recent past.
Our media needs to learn that until they start being fair & reporting the ABSOLUTE TRUTH (which includes NOT allowing other to use their platform to spread lies & propaganda) they certainly don't DESERVE to be rewarded with interviews or press conferences that they DEMAND! 
I know she doesn't need my advice but I think when she sits down to talk it should be with someone who actually cares about the truth & being fair. MeidasTouch doesn't say they are "fair & balanced" lol, they simply say "MeidasTouch because the TRUTH is GOLDEN!"
I hope someone on her campaign sees this.
Thanks.

Content: I agree that mainstream media does not call out lies and outright crap spewed by Agent Orange; however, pissing them off doesn't improve the situation,  Kamala and her team will decide what to do.  She's one clever politician.  In the meantime, forget about that and get to your peeps to engage this campaign and to vote.  We win with our vote and we don't have time wasting energy on the opposition and their stupidity.

Content: Hi Dillon - I'm glad you are focusing on this topic. 700,000 voted "uncommitted" in primaries in MI WI MN PA & other states. Biden won by only 43,000 votes in 3 states. I am preparing a document that has Kamala's positions, the voices of uncommitted resisters & the words of progressives that can help open dialogue.  Kamala and Joe have worked together on the ceasefire, hostage release & humanitarian aid. She has some daylight from but not much - she callled for ceasefire a little earlier for example & she's had more dialogue with resisters. Resisters liked her call for Palestinian self-determination in  DNC speech but understandably did not like her referencing sexual assault of Israelis but not Gazans. She gives MUCH more policy detail in her 8-25 statement -- I posted on this channel.  Most resisters are long-time Democrats who know very well the threat of Trump & reminders may not help & may be insulting [see CNN focus gp with uncommitted]. I will not create words to point out the down side of 1 issue voting but use the words of AOC [see my earlier post of her video], Bernie Sanders & others.  Dialogue obviously works. A prime example -  Kamala's conversion with the Dearborn mayor won him over. The refusal to have a vetted Palestinian speaker at the DNC who would have endorsed Kamala, may have cost Kamala tens of thousands of votes or more, e.g. Muslim Women for Kamala disbanded & will no longer back her. I suggest Kamala try hard to repair the damage- perhaps a major national event with Ruwa Romman giving her speech, hearing from the Dearborn mayor etc. -- basically for her to say what she did to protesters in AZ - I hear you and I see you.

Content: RFK JR has pushed out a mind-boggling number of harmful falsehoods over the years! He did some worthwhile environmental work early in his career and some young people are drawn to him for that reason. He has a lot to say about children‚Äôs health and many parents may not be able to sort fact from falsehoods.
Here are some fact-check articles and a John Oliver video to help you spread the facts and debunk the myths.  If you need a half hour of laughter with John Oliver & more than you want to know about RFK Jr,  watch the video - Dan https://youtu.be/1gUP_43J7wY

Content: I‚Äôm going to be honest and say when it comes to the Israel and Palestine stuff in my experience I‚Äôve found that most of the time it‚Äôs either someone you can reason with pretty quickly into understanding or someone who will immediately jump to bad faith arguments and name calling to shut the discussion down because they have their belief and they *wont* listen to others on it. It sucks, but in the last couple of weeks it‚Äôs basically come to not being worth my energy to bring it up unless the other person genuinely wants to have an actual discussion on it.

Content: I do think that a lot of the issue right now is figuring out how to get people to step outside the ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù of watching this from the media sources that offer commentary or frame it how they want you to see things. When you watch her speeches without any added flavor she does an impressive job of selling herself, it‚Äôs just up to us to get that through to people and so far it‚Äôs been working in our favor.

Content: Just had a wonderfully informative training session on online engagement!!! If you guys haven't taken the two part training yet, I really suggest it!! We covered how to approach an audience, with examples, along with how to use Reach to inform others, and how to recognize when an invitation to volunteer may be welcomed! So helpful and covered many of my questions!

Content: This is happening on YouTube as well. Some of it seems to be actual MAGA and some of it is almost certainly bots (just judging from account history/timelines/etc., some common grammar mistakes, no profile pic, etc.)

So I'd guess there is some kind of hybrid campaign going on (especially with the Ukraine offensive happening) by Russian assets to both provoke people into stating specific misinformation and stoke leftist infighting.

On YouTube they are targeting anything that comes up in the "In the News" section, so I'd be curious as to the contours of the targets on TT and reddit, if you have any sense of it.

I've been reporting accounts a lot but other than that the only thing I could think to do is apply some kind of counter resources. Kind of difficult to do, though.

Report, amplify the people fighting back, respond quickly if you can, note where it was, a general sense of what was said, and how much there was.

We might be able to get some investigative journalist on it as election interference stuff but I'm not sure how that would go trying to get Google to cooperate (a nonstarter with TT and reddit, I would imagine)

Content: It is definitely similar to stuff I saw back during 2016 with wikileaks and emailgate or whatever, but they don't have a viral story (yet).

Content: It's extremely similar to what I experienced in 2016, but with even more of a focus on leftist infighting than pro MAGA. "Vote third party" "democrats bad!! Jill Stein 4 President" type of rhetoric. I see it across every state subreddit I checked, especially when those subreddits allow for partisan conversation. I also see this infighting promotion a lot in comment sections of people who I follow who talk a lot about American politics, particularly women and gender non conforming people along with men of color. I see more pro MAGA stuff in comment sections on white men's posts. It's also quite noticeable when you come across someone who's an uncommitted voter. It's about 85% trolls when I start clicking on profiles, a really low number of profiles that seem genuine. Many don't have bios, or they have some weird profile picture and name, along with some other distinctive tells.

Content: When it comes to someone who is arguing in bad faith, or being aggressive, it's best to just tell them to have a nice day, or ghost them. We only have so much energy as individuals and it's better to spend our energy on people who want to be persuaded or informed than people who don't want it. I know it's not always easy to tell right up front, but when you feel like you're not getting anywhere, it's best to move on to someone who wants to hear the message. Best of luck to you friend!

Content: I‚Äôve had so much luck just using the DNC speeches from day four to push undecideds that generally lean towards biting their lip and voting republican to see that there is a lot of common ground. It‚Äôs been equally helpful to just side by side a trump speech next to bits from the DNC. Got one trump leaning voter to just watch it and he‚Äôs now in undecided territory strictly from the point that trump just‚Ä¶*rambles* for an hour or two and yells at people

Content: I've noticed that mentioning that Trump will be worse for Palestine doesn't resonate with the uncommitted, since from their perspective it can't get any worse, on top of the fact that the damage is happening right now. I think another way to go about it is emphasizing the need to not sabotage one's own capacity to advocate for them. 

If Harris wins, those protesting for Palestine will still be fighting for them.
If Trump wins, they won't. They'll be too busy fighting for their own survival here to dedicate any time or resources to what's going on there.

Content: Hi this is actually really odd for me to be involved in a campaign because I‚Äôm REALLY far left most of the time. The main drive behind this is that back in November an overarching feeling of accelerationist thinking kinda took hold in a lot of leftist circles of ‚Äúif both parties suck on the response to this then screw it nobody should be in charge‚Äù which I noticed gave a pretty big opening for some extremely divisive ideas to take hold. 

Personally, Palestine and Israel is a topic I rarely touch because I agree with a lot of what is being said but I‚Äôm also realistic enough to know that not voting and handing the keys to a lunatic who would rather see the Middle East a new parking lot and me dead is‚Ä¶unhelpful for everyone. So I‚Äôm here now. lol.

Content: How quickly people who were otherwise on the left reached for anti-Semitic rhetoric and started chanting ‚Äúfrom the River to the Sea‚Äù when it suited them just proves why the nation of Israel needs to exist. Every side of a political aisle will have anti-Semites. It was true from the days of the Crusades to the fifties until now.

Kamala‚Äôs position‚Äî Israel has a right to defend itself, but it needs to knock it off with the collateral damage to civilians ‚Äî is a *balanced and reasonable* take. 

‚ÄúPalestinians are Islamic and therefore enemies to our way of life‚Äù is *not.*

Content: being in a lot of full on leftist spaces is weird because you get some reasonable people like this and then you have anti-electorist tankies who basically say to not vote because "both sides are the same" like yeah both sides serve the same capitalist system that is legitimately harming a lot of people, but on the other hand one side is calling queer people like me groomers and p*dos so i dont want them in power

Content: Sometimes it seems there is a central Source Control/GitHub/SVN repository used to rapidly iterate on messaging and imagery.

That way, folks attached to it can update from it at least daily, and march back into the fray.

Setting something like that up isn't too labor intensive for someone who is relatively technology-savvy (i.e. one person can do the set up); it gets hectic in terms of change management for an organization of any size to ensure message consistency.

Content: 104 years ago today, the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote was certified by the US Secretary of State at 4am after receiving confirmation that Tennessee had become the 36th state to ratify the amendment.

The 19th Amendment had passed the Tennessee House 50-48 when 24-year-old Republican Harry Burn changed his vote after receiving a note from his mother.

That note, charted the course of history for women‚Äôs rights all the way up to this present day. The fundamental rights written in the Constitution, was not a given for women. Our ancestors, even as close as our Great-Grandparents were the champions of change that allowed us to have the liberties we do today. Fight for women everywhere. Fight for the future ones & the courage of those in the past. #WereNotGoingBack

Content: One of my all time favorite ways to unwind is to go to see indi music played at an indi music hall, because it's so intimate, it forces you to unplug from the external pressures we suffer from during the week, and reconnect to friends we haven't been able to really spend time with while working!

Content: I had an unusual experience on Facebook. When I told folks there that I would be volunteering for Harris, my brother-in-law gave me some pushback that ended with him abruptly refusing to discuss anything. In the last two days his wife has begun to post pro Harris-Walz memes. what a surprise!

For example, if I am speaking with a Trump supporter that is not aware of what Trump has said about the constitution, I could share a video of that. Is there something like that? I think it would be a really helpful resource to help get clarity and facts around important issues.

Content: There is a lot of video content on Reach. Also, I keep my eye on <#1252676126698897429> , where the campaign posts tons of video, including of the other side saying ridiculous things.

Content: Are there good resources for taking clips from the DNC and stitching it together?

I have people sharing misinformation about things not being covered at the DNC, and I know it was. I've been finding the timestamps for what I need, I'm just not sure what the best thing to use is for taking the clips. This content is not on Reach

Content: Colten from the Online Engagement Team suggested I post here. I wrote a comment on the New Yorker Facebook page a couple of mornings ago about how my life mirrored JD Vance‚Äôs,  but I became a Democrat, and why. Even though it‚Äôs a long comment, so far, it has received 545 positive reactions and lots of amazing comments. I am going to turn it into an essay, but want to make it and my story available to the campaign. I just need guidance as to what to do.

Content: (Colten is staff, and I'm not.)  I suggest joining [Republicans For Harris](http://bit.ly/RepublicansForHarris).  It's an official coalition of the campaign, and most are no longer registered Republicans.  You can contribute to its story bank, which it'll share to encourage others that it's ok to abandon the GOP.

Content: <@791857656897732648>  my story (part 1):
J.D. Vance‚Äôs life story, as told in ‚ÄúHillbilly Elegy,‚Äù resonated with me when I first read it. I was a product of generational poverty, with deep roots in the Deep South. I was a teenage mom, kicked out of high school, surrounded by all the social ills described by Vance. I was regularly told, by family, acquaintances, and society, that I would never, and could never, amount to anything. 

I almost believed it, but not quite. While still a teenager, I created a plan of escape. I started spending time with people who lived stable lives full of purpose. I earned my GED. I went to community college, where I became Student Senate President. I worked tirelessly to improve conditions for the 40,000 students I served. I did this while also a full-time mama, a full-time honors student and mama, and working part-time.

Content: <@791857656897732648> (part 2) I then earned a spot at one of the country‚Äôs ‚ÄúPublic Ivy‚Äôs,‚Äù
UW-Madison. After 12 years as a full-time college student, I graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs, master‚Äôs, and Ph.D. For the next 15 years, I worked in higher education, helping students like myself get the education they needed to create the lives they wanted. 

Unlike Vance, that journey I took from a girl preoccupied with day-to-day survival, to the young woman who found power and purpose in serving, to the woman I am now, determined to do what is best for my country and ALL its people, ensured I became a Democrat. 

Perhaps the difference is Vance is a lawyer, while I am a social scientist. Being a woman, and thus, the target of antiquated and misogynistic attitudes like Vance‚Äôs, also helped.

I know that every American, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, deserves a comfortable, secure, fulfilling life, and they can achieve it with hard work, support, respect, and HOPE. 

That is what the Democratic Party is all about. We are the party that rewards hard work, not inherited wealth. We support education and jobs that enable all Americans to create the life they want. We respect the choices our neighbors make- what they read, who they love, how they identify themselves, and what they do with their own bodies. The Democratic Party is the party of hope, because we are the party for all who believe in a good, loving, fair, and just America. We got your back. Now let‚Äôs win this thing, together!

Most said it was lie by the democrats and that he did not say that. I know I don‚Äôt let the negative one stop me I think it‚Äôs more important for those that said like, how do u deal with that

Plus I can see this becoming another media talking point when it has built up streams - similar to Obama vibes!

I am on Mastodon and the folks there have been asking for ways to amplify the official Kamala Harris accounts on that platform. Would it be possible for @kamalahq account on Threads to be federated so that we can amplify content on Mastodon?

Content: Have you guys checked out KamalaResume.com ?

People are starting to drop in comments when MAGAs start to question Kamala Harris‚Äôs qualifications or what has she ever done.

This is a living document that gets updated almost daily and it was created by a TikToker named Rachel Coyle @rachelcoyleohio

Content: Swifties for Harris -- if you are a Swiftie & cray-cray for Tay-Tay (who isn't!!) sign up for the big call at https://actionnetwork.org/events/swifties-for-kamala-kickoff-call  August 27 at 7 PM. Please send the link to Swifties you know or suspect are. For Joe Biden i& Kamala Harris in 2020 she did not endorse them until Oct. 7 saying "Under their leadership, I believe America has a chance to start the healing process it so desperately needs,"  In 2019 with Trump as president, she said  "The thing I can't get over right now is gaslighting the American public into being like... 'If you hate the president, you hate America.' We're a democracy‚Äîat least, we're supposed to be‚Äîwhere you're allowed to disagree, dissent, debate. I really think that he thinks this is an autocracy." In response to a comment Trump made about the George Floyd protests in 2020 she posted back to him " "After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? We will vote you out in November. @realdonaldtrump."  Wonder about reusing quotes like this?? see more in this recent article     https://www.newsweek.com/taylor-swift-donald-trump-kamala-harris-joe-biden-2024-election-1938982

Content: The amount of negativity I am getting from my post on Ss and Medicare it‚Äôs a very hot topic, mostly they are saying there is no agenda post, I already know that the agenda is being made and will be closed soon which will greatly help me. However, my problem is all of this negativity. I know I‚Äôm not upset by the negativity. It‚Äôs not lashing out at me per se. I take these ridiculous negativity and just bypass it things like shut up you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Lie lie lie oh and then my post on the right for a woman to choose not as hot but some good and mostly negative telling me to shut the hell up I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about and then someone put a meme up that has all these things about the person being responsible for creating life because they were irresponsible in protecting themselves, quite a conundrum there my biggest issue with this is OK you want no abortion who is going to take care of all these children that you‚Äôre saying must be through complete birth like being raped or having incest I just can‚Äôt believe people are not. I know I tried IV for a while and unfortunately didn‚Äôt get any results but we‚Äôve decided to be pets mom and dad. Is there any posting that shows trump saying that the dept of education is to be dismantled, thanks oh I would want to spend my time with the time lord Tom baker

Content: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Many Americans still don‚Äôt know the truth.

üçïP/zzagate was a conspiracy manufactured to cover up Trump‚Äôs crimes against young girls.

üíî It was a decoy operation: Epstein kidnapped a young girl named Maria from a pizza parlor (Nash‚Äôs pizza), whom Rump allegedly raped.

The entire psyops was created to shield Rump from being exposed.

The worst part is that they fooled everyone. 

We deserve to know the truth: https://www.justice-integrity.org/1445-welcome-to-waterbury-the-city-that-holds-secrets-that-could-bring-down-trump

Content: Yea, due to my political post on a community page there is complaints about, right now there is a vote going on for yes to political posting or no posting boy did I open a can of worms. Good thing is the yes‚Äôs are at 91% while no is at 77%. I am just awed that one person with one post would cause all of this attention. I am glad to get my community up and thinking I get reply‚Äôs everyday, and now I have a link to the 2024 platform, this really help people are reading all 92 pages of it. This may be a funny reply from my supporting Women‚Äôs right to make their own decisions about their body. This one from a young man, asking hy I support it because I am a man, needless to I reply that I have family members very.  concerned about this for their daughters, so I posed a reverse ?  Would they get a vasectomy if told by government men had to do this, he said yes and I was a puppet from the mainline news fake news like cnn, nbc and so on, just wow, so embedded with Trump I really see this as a big deal, on how the general public think, as this one is brainwashed totally for Trump no persuading this man so I stop.

Content: Thanks much for these talking points Tamilu! I saw this was from July 24. We can add points from her detailed econ policy from her speech 10 days ago. https://youtu.be/qR4eehb5Kw8 Regarding disappointment that more progressive proposals were not realized -- we need to say clearly that MAGA Republicans blocked most of them. For example, Republicans blocked the John Lewis Voting Rights Act & related legislation, MAGA justices blocked most student debt relief, yesterday a court blocked a Biden-Harris order that said undocumented spouses of US citizens could move toward citizenship without first leaving the country. Just got the attached beautifully written talking points from Bernie S that opens with "The so-called "radical" and ‚Äúfar left‚Äù agenda that we are fighting for is, in poll after poll, far more popular than Donald Trump, more popular than the Republican Party, and it is supported by a strong majority of the American people, including Republicans and Independents."

Content: Kamala cooking: hope you've seen this delightful video of Kamala cooking with Mindy Kaling. Republicans use it to say it proves she is "Indian" and nothing else, and that she has a cackling weird laugh. Democrats say "Did you see her attack that onion with a knife??

Content: No‚Ä¶.its probably unfortunately organic. A lot of leftists that are in the single issue Palestine camp have latched onto her lately after oddly drifting off of RFK. 

I‚Äôm all for more political engagement but trying to point out that Jill is pretty much all but certainly a Russian backed spoiler just tends to shove their mindset further in the direction we *dont* want to push them. For what it‚Äôs worth I do my best when I see it come up to educate on her background and the fact she literally took photos in Moscow with Putin, but it‚Äôs mixed on that as far as response goes.

Content: <@1271152855646081185> this argument comes directly from Project 2025 .. just like Board of Education, ROE, Chevron, Immunity ... use the courts to circumvent We Thee People and institute Draconian measures that are NOT wanted in these United States 
Trump said it out loud.
Project 2025 outlined in black in white.
Congress is attempting to get it through while We Thee People are distracted
The CON is ON!

Content: Yes, I just posted it a couple of hours ago on my Facebook. Also found the link for cooking for Kamala on one of my friends posts. I will be attending Thursday. Thank-you, anything else you can share would be greatly appreciated. I think it‚Äôs best to reach as many groups as possible and some don‚Äôt allow political posts.

Content: It's just so stupid. Today's Republicans are the types of people who came up with nonsensical race science, ridiculous one-drop rules, and paranoiac Racial Integrity laws...and the xenophobic immigration policies to back them up. So no wonder they're confused that one person can be more than one thing at one time. So dishonest. üòí

Content: I was wondering if anyone has good replies or discussion points to try and dispel the notion that because grocery prices are high that the economy is doing bad and its Biden / Harris's fault. I understand clearly our economy is doing great if you look at all the other factors but a lot of people only wanna focus on grocery prices because that is the thing right in front of them affecting them the most.  Any tips on would be much appreciated for helping to talk to neighbors as well as people online. I see it a lot in my FB groups and such.

Content: Well I have had a very important eye opening experience about my own community group. I posed a question and started a firestorm. I asked about Ss and Medicare I had  over 180 replies and still getting them. What happen is 1 it was an uncensored group with a rule that stated if you don‚Äôt like it by pass it, well  apparently they are censored and are voting to ban all political posts. As national elections have no place in a community and only local and Trump and magna  post don‚Äôt count. I learned a valuable lesson here choose wisely what u post. There was no political propaganda if you call links to the democratic agenda or even to the republican agenda that is now considered propaganda. I have chosen to leave the group along since it after discovering it manly trumpers. So I switched my posting and are now taking zoom calling phone bank training. Even a lot of post supporting me and the right to post as it does have and effect on community who ever wins. I left.

The best part for our purposes is that creator for these videos *isn‚Äôt* Democrat per se. It‚Äôs a pro-Union page, independent of political party. (Corporatist Dems also get trawled.) It should be more palatable than a main stream media source.

Content: I would also point out that bodegas and the like charge cost+. When Tyson hikes the price of chicken without paying farmers or packers more (gouging) that filters into the local store because it paid more for the product. A ban on gouging (if written properly) would hit Tyson, not the bodega. Similarly, big chains can negotiate for lower prices from suppliers in ways small grocery stores cannot. Failing to pass those savings onto the consumer or laborer (in the form of wages and benefits) is also a form of gouging.

Content: Right-leaning people are picturing a  gouging bill that exclusively targets retailers rather than suppliers and caps the overall cost rather than the margin. Corporate chains can absorb such a rule and small grocers cannot. (Such a bill would further solidify the corporate monopolies.)

Content: I‚Äôve got about 700 friends on Facebook.  They‚Äôre mostly Democrats, so I very seldom get a bad reply or post.  I post approx 6-12 images & shorts per day.  My response rate has drastically increased.  (You know ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù can give you stats!). I‚Äôm trying to attend campaign classes, but I‚Äôm busy!!!  I text messaged an old donations page for my cousin.  I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll pass it on.  Haven‚Äôt found one online, so I‚Äôll look for a graphic with a link to Act Blue for texting.  That will help control who sees the ad.  I‚Äôll ask for a text msg ad in another spot.  Have a great day!

Content: It seems the RWM (Right Wing Media) has resurrected an old story about Joey Piscitelli and DA Harris and how she refused to cooperate with sexual abuse victims of priests in the Catholic Church. My friend was incensed. I found several RWM stories about it and only 2 that explained her position. Sometimes I feel like I'm playing whack-a-mole.  I sent him the links to the 2 stories, pointed out her history with prosecuting child abuse cases for 3 years and asked him if he's read anything about Project 2025. I told him that Project 2025 was what I was afraid of, not something that happened decades ago. I haven't heard back from him.

Content: I have so many favorite songs depending on my mood.  Recently I had the pleasure of seeing Lucie Arnaz in a cabaret setting. She is in her 70's but still gorgeous and much more talented than I ever thought. She sings a song called "The Music in Your Heart" that I can't get out of my head.

Content: Kamala Cooks Bacon-Fried Applies: I posted this video for you yesterday without viewing the whole thing [sloppy of me]. The last 3 minutes brought me near tears. Kamala is door-knocking for Obama in Iowa. An 80-something woman says with a sullen face, "They're not going to let him win." Kamala decides to converse at length. I urge you to watch this -- starts at minute 4:10.  Kamala tells the lesson learned -"When we believe that it's possible, even when it's against the odds . . . "  A 3 minute clip and the quotes would be great for posting -- does that request go here or another channel?

Content: Inflation is a global concern that's been going on for a while, and it‚Äôs worth noting that Harris has been working to curb it since before her run. As of August 14, 2024, the inflation rate in the United States was 2.9% for the 12 months ending July 2024. This is the smallest 12-month increase since March 2021, when prices rose 2.6%. Also, keep in mind that it‚Äôs in the best interest of billionaire CEOs to keep prices high. ALSO, and this is a key point, remember that for decades,  the US economy has performed better when the president of the United States is a Democrat rather than a Republican, almost regardless of how one measures performance. There is a pronounced Democratic advantage in nearly every measure of macroeconomic performance.

Content: ‚ÄúAnother common answer is that unprecedented levels of government spending had a hand to play. But historically, economists have largely agreed that the link between government spending and inflation remains weak.

A full half of today‚Äôs inflation, they discovered, stems from ongoing supply chain issues as producers struggle to push out enough goods to meet demand. The war in Ukraine and resulting energy shortage, alongside a turbulent housing market, have also contributed to inflation, pushing up prices from several directions at once.‚Äù - https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/08/25/does-government-spending-cause-inflation/

Content: Kamala's Handling of Priest Child Sexual Abuse Cases. Thanks for raising this Barb.  I've read several articles [can't find all of them now]. I believe her stance was that she could not legally release records in civil cases when informal requests were made by victims & she could not criminally prosecute.    You probably found these articles from this month - one on her toughness with cases generally & one totally trashing her. If you're up for it, would love to have from you a few sentences to that pushback -- I can use on twitter  https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/08/22/kamala-harris-sex-crimes-prosecutor-00175347  https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/08/22/kamala-harris-covered-sexual-abuse-allegations-prosecutor-claiming-fight-victims-dnc/

Content: Gas being up 46.6% doesn't seem right though...and it doesn't say compared to when? This year? Last four years? I feel like the meme itself is deceptive (but how I feel is irrelevant) so Im curious if it "is" deceptive. Also I feel like a meme refuting the info would be good if it is infact incorrect or deceptive or at least something that clarifies the numbers.

Content: Imagine RFK, Jr. as Secretary of Health & Human Services, the man who claimed the Covid-19 vaccination campaign was intended to ‚Äúmake you a slave.‚Äù He looks like an ideal choice for a Trump II, given Trump‚Äôs dabbling in disinfectants and horse pills to cure Covid while hundreds of thousands of Americans died. Voters should consider the reflections of Trump‚Äôs own Covid Task Force Coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx.

Content: Here is one article I posted to my friend that made some sense to me. It's in keeping with then DA Harris, and now VP Harris' respect and integrity for the law.  She has never interpreted the law according to her desire for what it should be. She works with what it is. But she has also been concerned for victims and the accused. Her supporters call her pragmatic.  Corey Cook, a political scientist and provost at St. Mary's College, and a longtime observer of San Francisco politics said, "She's [Harris} not an ideologue,, she tends to focus on specific problems. 
"The idea that she would have consistent positions on issues informed by ideology isn't who she is," said Cook.  And   ... Harris' focus on the victims of abuse and exploitation continued after she was elected as San Francisco's District Attorney. "I don't know what the term 'teenage prostitute' means. I have never met a 'teenage prostitute.' I have met exploited kids."  Harris then ordered her prosecutors not to use the term in court. A year later, Harris sponsored a bill putting the crime of human trafficking into the state criminal code.  For me, I see her position in the Catholic priest issue as very consistent with her ability to make hard decisions and do unpopular things because it's the right thing to do. https://www.factcheck.org/2024/08/trumps-false-and-misleading-claims-about-harris-record-on-crime/   https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/the-real-kamala-harris-what-her-california-years-19579143.php

Content: In re: Energy Policy and/or Energy Pricing

I am including a data-driven site that was suggested to me by someone who is an expert in such things.

This site includes maps, charts, and energy-related topics, which may be helpful in the event you find yourself in the weeds or want to fact-check what you are hearing/reading:

Content: You are absolutely right to be skeptical. Often, it's sufficient to just reply with something like what you wrote: "I don't know but these numbers seem off. And over what time period is this? Do you have a source for this information?" Make them do the work. What they will find is that there is no source b/c it's fiction --or a mish-mosh of half truths, at best. If you're interested,  you can compare gas prices here: gasprices.aaa.com

Content: Additionally, some energy and pricing bullet points to consider:
- Energy is a global market and POTUS has limited impact/influence in global pricing
- Fuel prices were down in 2020 because countries world-wide were locking down/shutting down and thus decreased demand; OPEC cut oil production.
- Once countries began to "return to normal", demand returned to roughly what it was BUT OPEC kept oil production roughly the same
- The US has never been energy-independent; we have more permits/leases and are pumping more but we are still running at an energy-deficit

Content: I have filled out my online engagement map. My engagements range from 4 in my family to 12,300 followers on Twitter. I have to figure out how to do this on Twitter b/c my followers expect programming comments, not political. But this is too important not to leverage that audience. Can't wait for Part 2.

Content: Hi Jesse:

Consider where your flavor and sector of programming might touch or overlap policy or recent Hot Topics.

Examples might be:
- Section 230
- Cybersecurity
- Consumer & Data Privacyl (e.g. GDPR and CCPA)
- Quants and trading
- "The TikTok Ban"

Content: I've been imagining RFK JR as head of DHHS or CDC or FDA way too much! As I learn more about him, though, it's possible Trump will appoint him as Director of the U.S. Forest Service. He conscientiously removed a large animal carcass from a roadway & we know he has a chainsaw, which he likes to use for cutting off the heads of dead animals for his "research"  üòé  Jerry - the video of Birx is terrific -thanks! Here's an article with good quotes of her's https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/04/25/former-trump-covid-official--response-was-a--tragedy-on-many-levels-  MAGA  like to post on twitter that more people died of Covid under Biden - My response: "Though more died during Biden's term, Trump's inaction & disinformation likely had a delayed effect. Research shows Trump caused 450K unnecessary deaths & was the greatest driver of disinformation! A medical journal called his response "appalling.""

Content: I want to query leaders about the use of Randy Rainbow videos on online sites, especially his latest one which is about six minutes and titled, "The Lawyer and the Conman."  Do you think such a video is effective in changing people's minds? I posted the link in a thread of NextDoor.com called "Local Liberals."  I got positive response from folks on that thread, but what really surpised me was that I received a congratulatory message from NextDoor.com administrators two days later telling me that my post had been viewed by 640 people. I was astonished.

Supposed to get 25 points per share so I should have 50 points, but I have 0. It‚Äôs not like I need those points to pay the rent but I‚Äôd like the credit due. So, any idea if I did it wrong?

Content: Hi Courtney - good questions -- young people are concerned about prices like never before - gas, groceries, and unable to buy a house, etc.. I posted videos that address inflation at 2:25 yesterday. I am sure you can find written comments from Warren & Reich, too.  Here is one fact-check article on Kamala's capital gains proposal  https://www.axios.com/2024/08/23/kamala-harris-unrealized-capital-gains-tax . Others on this channel with econ expertise beyond have discussed this. I can almost always find fact checks on any issue with a Google search like: "fact check Kamala Harris [then whatever the issue is]"

Content: Keep in mind a few things:

1. inflation: The FED targets 2% inflation. The expectation in a growth economy is that "normal" price increases are always going to be 2%-3%. Too low, is bad for economic growth. Too high, is bad for all of us consumers. Different sectors of the economy have different historical inflation rates (housing vs medical vs college vs food/groceries).
2. Vice President isn't really capable of controlling inflation. President has more control over that, but it's largely a function of Federal Reserve policy. I also like to speak to friends about U.S. inflation versus other advanced economic countries - U.S. brought down inflation much faster than every other country in the world. 
3. Tariffs passed during 2016-2020 also drove inflation for years to come on numerous products. A bike I bought my son at REI in 2017 was about 30% more expensive just 9 months later after Trump instittuted tarrifs targeted at China. We can agree or disagree with the purpose of tariffs - but they absolutely get passed on to the consumer. Trump wants even higher tariffs if he's elected in 2024. 
4. Harris is campaigning on combating price gouging - this is not the same as price controls. 

These talk points are only used with my social media community - i don't get into this while phone or text banking, and keep it much higher level. But, if you're trying to engage people who are listening in good faith -  you can google some of what I said above and find plenty of stories and data to reference. The bike story for me is really personal because i couldn't believe how much more it was when I went to buy another one for my younger child. The impact was quite swift.

Content: Others are providing great talking points. I'd also like to say that you do not have to be a policy expert. None of us do. Heck, half the time, even the experts don't agree on this stuff. What has been working for me is to empathize/"meet people were they are," and steer the convo towards common sense/what people see with their own eyes. (Personally, I've seen prices starting to come down in the grocery store and elsewhere.) I also re-posted a meme that might be useful for summing up some of this: https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1265762143559618624/1278734838492434433

Content: Speaking of Swifties for Kamala ‚Äì here is a video of the call  https://youtu.be/r9lQlWzQLPQ Two hours, 34,000 were on the call, raising $122,000.
Speakers & The Minute They Appear on the Video [missing some regional organizers near the end]:
Sen. Elizabeth Warren 11:58
Rep. Becca Balint ‚Äì VT 16:00
Rep. Chris Deluzio PA 20:50
Carole King 28:00
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand NY 34:35
Kim McMurray from Indivisible explains ‚ÄúNeighbor to Neighbor‚Äù Program 41:18
Sen Ed Markey MA 45:38
Representative from ‚ÄúVote from Abroad‚Äù 1:16:30
Every one of the speakers is a committed Swiftie [including 78-year-old Ed Markey} & could discuss favorite Swift songs & albums. Carole King talked about her friendship with Taylor & sees herself as Taylor‚Äôs grandmother.  Would be lovely to have one 4-5 minute video of some key speakers talking about their love for her music. One of several summaries of the event is here.
 ‚ÄúIn their ‚Äòvoting era,‚Äô Swifties for Kamala organize to register voters for Harris - More than 34,000 people joined a Zoom call Tuesday led by the group Swifties for Kamala‚Äù  - Justine McDaniel, August 28, 2024 https://wapo.st/3T6NRL0
In the article: The voting bloc that could decide the US election: Swifties ‚Äì Sherman. 3-13-24 https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/13/taylor-swift-us-election-politics-joe-biden-donald-trump we learn that just over half of her fans are Democrats, 23% are Republicans, and another 23% are independents. Given her unprecedented popularity, Swifties seem to be a key group to reach.

Content: Message for Swifties?? I drafted this message after reading the Newsweek article I posted a few days ago that covers everything Taylor has said about Trump. What do you think of this -
Taylor is pretty quiet when it comes to politics. But did you know she‚Äôs had some things to say about Donald Trump?  In response to a comment Trump made during the George Floyd protests in 2020, she posted: "After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? We will vote you out in November."

Content: Hey everyone. I‚Äôve been reading news stories today about republican governors purging voter rolls in their states . Greg Abbott bragged about removing over a million registered voters over the past 3 years . Youngkin in Virginia just used executive order to purge nearly 300,000 voters . We know they‚Äôre doing this in Ohio and today I‚Äôm discovering it‚Äôs happening in every red and swing state that has a republican governor to oversee it and make it happen. You can search these articles yourself and I am STRONGLY URGING EVERY AMERICAN TO CHECK THEIR VOTER REGISTRATION ‚ÄºÔ∏è

Content: Do we have any explicit plans to boost good takes/parts of the interview today and thumbs down, suppress, and otherwise avoid engaging with negative or frankly asinine takes?

I'm probably going to simultaneously watch, like, and post/repost/boost on youtube and tiktok, myself.

Content: The comments section of the clip that was put out (by CNN) is flooded with pure spam bots and MAGA.

I'm not sure if we care about that (or if YouTube comments is even a relevant place to try to win), but a lot of it is reportable.

Content: Here is an article on ways Kamala's positions have evolved: "In a statement, her campaign said her current positions have been shaped by ‚Äúthree years of effective governance‚Äù and reflect her ‚Äúpragmatic approach, focusing on common-sense solutions for the sake of progress.""  https://www.kcci.com/article/harris-reintroduces-herself-with-evolved-policy-positions/61966072 She seems to have moderated on green new deal, healthcare etc. Was NEVER border czar or supported defunding police or ICE.  Attached is my latest list of fact-check articles.

Content: Yikes! The comments section on the first video is brutal. I left a positive comment, üëç the video and üëé as many negative comments as I could.

Content: It's pretty clear that the comments are coming from people who already have their minds made up. I heard this clip earlier and thought yes!!  She is somebody who values (that I agree with) haven't changed. To have a President who will try and work with the problem as it is today and find a solution is what we need. I, too, just left a positive message.

Content: Yeah just fyi for people; on youtube the thing that üëé do is actually bury the comment lower and lower when you have your comments set to "sort by: top comments"  which is the default. So you don't get immediate feedback like on reddit, but it is doing something!

Content: My wife and I host whiskey tastings 2 or 3 times a year and our next one on 9/6 will be a Kamala Tim fundraiser.  We currently have over $5K in money in or pledges for this Open House.  I used this tasting as a way to engage my email networks and encourage relational organizing in the digital sphere for the campaign.  It produced many fruitful conversations and has moved a lot of my friends into action.

Content: So far, I've reported almost each individual contact and post online to the campaign via REACH.  I am proud to say that I was the July leader and am certainly in the lead in August.  I will leave that alone at this point.  I will now submit reports only to share effective ways of creating conversations and moving people into action.  This will double my real outreach (won't need to do so much reporting on REACH) and produce more effective connections/conversations with my friends and family.  I have a real self-interest.  Not only am I pushing important information about the campaign to friends/family, I'm actually re-connecting with a lot of people.  As a retired person, I have the time for this and it's f*ing awesome.

Content: You Can‚Äôt Believe Trump‚Äôs Campaign Promises: In 2016, Trump promised that he would protect Social Security or Medicare. Guess what? Every year he was President, Trump proposed cuts to Social Security and Medicare.

Trump Didn‚Äôt Say He Would Vote for Florida‚Äôs Pro-Abortion Access Referendum: Under pressure from the anti-abortion activists in the party, Trump immediately walked back his statement. His spokesperson put out a statement saying that Trump didn‚Äôt mean to suggest how he would vote in Florida this fall. He wants to keep his position fuzzy. Since Trump‚Äôs position is that abortion is up to the states, we should assume he is voting to uphold Florida‚Äôs state ban until he explicitly says otherwise.

Trump Doesn‚Äôt Support Protecting IVF: Trump has refused to support, and his running mate voted against, efforts to enshrine protections for IVF.

Content: RE Trump Paying for IVF -- one commentator said he's tied to RNC platform that opposes IVF, BUT the opposite is true: "4. Republicans Will Protect and Defend a Vote of the People, from within the States, on the Issue of Life
"We proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments)."        You can see how they have moderated. Best tact perhaps is to show him being proud of getting judges who overturned Roe that then allowed AL Supreme Court to ban IVF

Content: Thank you! I edited the comment above although that talking point also hedged with the word "could." I like the idea of using his pride in overturning Roe that led to AL ban on IVF.

Content: ‚ÄúLeave it up to the states‚Äù seems like a ‚Äúwink wink‚Äù to me. What is he going to hold over the states to get them to do what he wants. This is a classic example of saying something that sounds reasonable but in reality puts these ‚Äúrights‚Äù in the hands of a man who can then quid pro quo with states while hiding behind it being their decision. I can just hear it now, ‚Äúyou want this federal funding for your schools, well not until you change (insert law of choice).‚Äù
I removes the obvious blame but not the control. We all know his over developed sense of grievance and revenge, the only way to protect the states from manipulation is to have the right protected at the federal level.

Content: Good points. Am loving what Ruth Marcus said this week "Why should anyone believe Trump on this question? After all, he just chose a vice-presidential nominee who said in 2022 that he ‚Äúcertainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.‚Äù
Now comes Arkansas with more evidence that the ‚Äúleave it to the states‚Äù argument is a crock"  https://wapo.st/3Xl9EkK  Several Dems in the last week have made strong statements -- with the existing state bans women are suffering and have almost died [see DNC speeches of women & partners suffering]. Also women in a banned state going to other states put a huge burden on those clinics -- also burden on women in the south is great because they must travel hundreds or thousands of miles https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html?smid=url-share  [gift articles]

Content: Hmm has anyone noticed on YT - that if they post comments in support of Harris, folks will report them as bots and get the comments removed? 

I've had several comments today in support of Harris just disappear off of YT. Shows in my post history, but not on the video.

Content: Hey y'all - I'm going to look into this a bit more at a more reasonable hour, but I just got back from seeing some old friends I haven't seen in years - center to right politics

No one tried to be rude or "catch" me in anything, it was all respectful, just at the end of the night we wound up having like an hour long parking lot conversation about politics

Claims that I tried my best to wade through while very tired:
 - Biden is currently mentally unfit for office if Harris is stepping in, and the whole thing is shady
 - It's ironic that Harris is supporting a "border wall" (I'd never heard of this and just said she supports the bipartisan bill)
 - Protections against price gouging and fixing "did not go well in some other countries" ie it's communist and will ruin the country - I do not know enough about the policies or economics to speak to this, though of course it's not what I think
 - There's nothing to stop people buying and selling homes to raise the price of homes another 25k if they know someone is going to be getting it
 - Something about the child tax credit being $6000 one year, then half of that the next, then half the year after or gone?

My friend said that his source for some of this is campaign materials. There isn't a policy page on the website. May I ask where I can go for policy resources? May I ask if anyone knows about any of these things or has a good way to respond?

Thank you!

You can search in the upper right search window with terms like "border" and "gouging." Also this article might help: https://www.politico.com/interactives/2024/kamala-harris-tim-walz-policy-2024-election/

I am looking forward to being able to amplify policy platform to the most degree possible, emphasizing the reasons people should vote FOR Harris and Walz in addition to the reasons to vote against Trump.

Content: I am getting comments from my friend/family Trump supporters about Biden and Harris not going to Arlington and that they never reached out to Gold Star families. Brother-in-law keeps saying Biden preferred to be on vacation. Everything I see online verifies that, although most sources are Fox News or similar. How are we responding to this?

Content: This was the third anniversary of the Kabul airport attack. Did T mark the anniversary the first or second time? Both Harris and Biden offered official statements. I do not think it is customary for the president or vp to visit Arlington to mark these types of occasions? If I, the daughter of veterans, were responding, I might also add that T is a rapist, fraudster, traitor and convicted felon and that he is despicably using our fallen heroes for his own political gain.

Content: Biden has gone to Arlington on Memorial Day  [probably every year]--- announcement this year: WASHINGTON ‚Äì "The nation‚Äôs 155th National Memorial Day Wreath-Laying and Observance Program to honor America‚Äôs fallen will be live-streamed from Arlington National Cemetery beginning at 11 a.m. EDT, Monday, May 29.  The U.S. Army Military District of Washington will conduct a Presidential Armed Forces Full Honors Wreath-Laying Ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, followed by an observance program in the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery. A prelude by the U.S. Navy Band and Sea Chanters will begin in the amphitheater at 10:15 a.m. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will lay the wreath at the ceremony hosted by Maj. Gen. Allan M. Pepin, commanding general of Joint Task Force-National Capital Region and the U.S. Army Military District of Washington. Attendance at the wreath-laying ceremony will be limited to official participants only."    Biden this year went to a military cemetery in Europe that Trump refused to go to. Here is an article on that & one on Harris vs Trump on military

Content: This sounds like a coordinated reporting campaign by (most likely) a "combined arms" team of people and bots.

Wish we had a space and tools to collect data on this to give it to several journalistic outlets. This is the kind of suppression that goes along with the misinformation campaigns that it's hard to even notice (because most people aren't checking).

Content: What are we doing about Pennsylvania?  I'm hearing there are no yard signs for Harris/Walz, but tons for trump/vance.  Polls are showing she's still struggling there. What can we do to help? I think she needs more time there. Besides the suburbs of Philly, where else can she eke out votes. Pittsburgh, Allentown, Reading, Scranton...none of these towns are growing. Her middle class/labor message might resonate if we can find a way to reach them.

Content: Right. The polls are basically all within the margin of error. But PA is pretty critical, and there are other signs that it's going slowly. I prefer to call it concern, not panic. And I'd rather be concerned now instead of after the election.

Content: <@&1252689433208291358> -  I am in the REACH Action Feed trying to download the video about Kamala being for working people (for my Facebook timeline), but when I try to download the video on my MacBook Pro, it tries to download it in my Windows Parallels virtual machine and says it fails. But, when I look in my Mac download folder, the video file  DOES show up. When I upload the video to my Facebook timeline, Facebook tells me it will take a while to upload because it is a 17MB file.  Why not simply provide a Youtube link instead of a uploading large video files at each social media platform? Is there a Youtube repository with all the links. It would be a lot faster. Please advise.

Content: Where can I find all Harris Walz campaign video ads (including associated TV ads from other non campaign orgs and PACs)? They are not easy to find in the REACH library. It seems that we should prominently display YouTube links to all related video ads. Thanks.

Content: This gave me an idea for a new section, sort of a preamble about jow to orient yourself when you get slapped with these masses of comments and huge upvote numbers. So thanks! You already helped. üòÉ

Feel free to DM me and I can run an early draft by you whenever I finish it or if you have more ideas you can just lay them on me. I don't really have another public platform (it's all distributed pseudonyms), so I'll have to create a publicly facing identity under which to post whatever we end up making.

Anyone else interested in this. Also feel free to DM me!

Content: To echo what Bobby B. said above: Encouraging them to elaborate ("Go on") or asking them to clarify are good options to try to suss out the difference between a bot, someone who is trolling/being disingenuous, or a person who might be some sort of True Believer.

Take heart. The first two are far, far more common and they're trying to bait you into some sort of emotional reaction. As for the rare last person, be cautious, don't let them take over the conversation with their rhetoric, and find a way to end the contact. Sometimes, people are just not ready to hear anything that isn't confirmed by their world view.

As for the rhetoric itself, I've been hearing/reading similar for twenty (and more) online years. They have been emboldened and are saying the quieter parts out loud.

Content: Get your friend connected with PA Dems. They have phonebanks and more. Also while signs don't vote, local field offices are the best place to look. I'll tell you right now, there wasn't a bunch of signs in very purple Bucks County where I live in 2022 but it didn't matter. Also, don't look at those polls. 2016 is a great example on why.

Content: I can understand the need to worry about Pennsylvania. Democrats are struggling not just in the polls, but also in the ground game as Scott Presler's team has been narrowing the voter registration gap between our side and the Republicans. Nonetheless, I do hold hope that Kamala will be able to reverse the tide once she and Walz return to the state and rally their voters there.

Content: Winning either PA or NC is really important because (assuming we win Nevada or Arizona in the case of NC) it makes the Georgia election czars and their bogus rules moot, and we‚Äôre much more likely to with PA than NC even if NC is realistic and on the table. In other words, PA is the most important state on the map without a fairly clear winner. You win PA, you are extremely likely to win the whole thing.

That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so much anxiety around it. Because those 19 electoral votes will determine a winner in a lot of scenarios.

Content: PA & Polling: Hi - I am also concerned about PA, given that voting starts soon & seeing results of the most reliable polling. I am writing postcards to PA with Activate America for house races that should get people out for Kamala. I might add phone banking. Right now, the 538 poll averages [adjusted for sample size, poll quality, party lean, etc.] show Harris: WI +3.2 MI +2.4 PA +1.2 NV + 0.7 GA +0.5 AZ +0.3 NC -.04.  Attached is a handout on forecasting that has helped guide my efforts

Content: I know that I look at polls too much. Keep in mind, things are going extraordinarily well for the Harris-Walz campaign. At some point there will be a bump in the road or something out of our control. The best way to deal with that nervous energy is get out there, listen to voters, make a connection and just be authentic about why we support this ticket. You don't need to mimic talking points or know all the nuances of public policy...just be one person connecting with another. 

Now, let's go win this thing!!

Content: I have an admin in a local FB group page in my voting district posting a meme from DJT stating Kamala Harris never worked at McDonalds, she lies about everything. I have no control of it. The information is out there. And now it gets worse as I scroll down they are telling people to take notes on who is talking and take notes.

Content: My ex  worked for McDonald's. I thought I remembered this correctly. They only have to keep employment records for 1-3 years. If it was a franchise store the owner could delete records and a lot of them didn't bother keeping the kids who worked there.

Content: <@1199911282623664181>  So based on Snopes and Barbara's excellent info there is no proof for them to say Harris didn't work there. She said she did and so theirs is just a baseless accusation.  Obviously this hits a nerve and they want it not to be true. As far as them taking notes, what are they planning on doing with them? I am hoping not, but sounding like Stazi in East Germany  getting people to report on others. Sounds scary, but it would be good to question the intent, if possible.

Content: I used to work for McDonalds. They do not keep the records long, but yes the owners may remember her, her parents, her friends, a photo, her word. it is from the mouth of the man himself, so I assume it is a lie and projection of some sorts, just another distraction for keeping me from doing my own work and helping us flip blue. They are afraid of me.

Content: Honestly the McDonalds debate seems so silly to me. I am in my upper 40s (so younger than Harris). As a teen I worked at both McDs and Burger King. Neither ever showed ‚Äúin my resumes‚Äù cuz why would they? The jobs didn‚Äôt apply to anything I was applying for and honestly HRs etc tend to by and large ignore those first jobs and back in the day we were generally told not to bother putting them on unless for some reason they apply to what you‚Äôre trying to do or you can show them somehow applying. 

In addition, the McDs I worked at closed so - no records. The Burger King is still there but I can guarantee that 30+ years later - they aren‚Äôt gonna have the records of that teen that worked there for 6 months lol

The only person who knows I worked there and that still talk to would maybe confirm it, but would you wanna be in the middle of this political circus and become a target just to confirm someone else worked at McDs 30 years ago

Content: They are trying to distract us from the real issues again. Post information from reach on the subject at least three times. You can block negative comments so don't respond. I live next door to MTG's district so I understand your concern. But if we allow them to win. We will be in even more trouble because they will have permission to persecute us.

Content: Most everyday people will know the narrative is silly and also - completely irrelevant to her candidacy too. There isn‚Äôt a real reason for her to lie about it. She has other regular jobs she could also point to. Their campaign is only making a big deal because DJT has exactly zero everyday people experience or jobs that weren‚Äôt given through nepotism

Ok if single speaker but with two people in the video you only see an empty frame. It is also bad if there are words that need to be read in the rectangle only half shows up on the post. It‚Äôs great content but looks pretty bad. Can someone pass this along to the creator group

Content: The volume (both in the amount and how loud it can be) can be overwhelming. It's like lifting up a large rock only to find a bunch of things crawling around down there. Kinda gross, maybe a little weird, but relatively harmless. üòÜ 

I am glad you took a break and regroupped. Those will be some of your strongest tools when engaging with the public and your local communities.

I have had some success redirecting the conversation by asking where/who/how/when a person or a group got the information "so I can look it up later" and then changing or re-engaging on a facet of the conversation or a safer talking point.

You are not alone and you got this!

Content: Hi all, I just finished watching on Amazon Prime: #Unfit: The Psychology of Donald Trump. It was very insightful and helped me understand why anyone would follow Donald Trump from a psychological perspective. If you haven't seen it, I suggest watching it. Now the question is...how do we suggest to Trump supporters to watch it too?

Content: So., we need a resource that just provides direct responses to the common b.s.,  like "McDonald's doesn't have a record of her".  It's ridiculous to have every individual Democrat have to generate a brand new response every time someone sees that (or others) old trope.  Would save millions of man hours to just have a template to work from, on these  common ones.

Content: More often than not - responding to misinformation does nothing but amplify it even louder given the nature of algorithms! We recommend that we do not respond to attacks or false info online - rather we make sure we amplify the things that are true to drown out the noise!

Content: Does anyone know what the turnaround time for videos on Reach is? I watched the Pittsburgh event from clips by Aaron Rupar on Twitter, went to Reach to share, searched for Pittsburgh and found nothing. I realize it takes more time to post something polished but I really liked her closer and how passionate she was about opportunity. I don‚Äôt really understand why people says she‚Äôs vague other than deliberately misunderstanding what she‚Äôs saying.

Content: This essentially has to be dealt with by journalists . Unless someone comes up with a bot campaign to fight disinfo on youtube, it's too much effort for volunteers to fight a couple of computers working arounf the clock to disseminate garbage. I've been working on a guide for collecting data to hand over to them as evidence of a coordinated disinfo campaign so they have less work to do to write an effective story.

Content: For YouTube, you want:
- how you navigated to the page including what dection it was under if it was labeled. (This is for how they are targeting)
- how long the video has been up
- how many views it has
- how many likes
- how many comments (just the number, you don't need to count the bot ones manually that's too much work)
- screenshots of the comments

As you're doing this you can report everything if you'd like. Again, the point is to collect data, not fight the fire yourself, but it always makes me feel better to do some reporting. xD

I'm putting a guide together with examples but I don't yet have a place to put it.

Last note: important to remember they have to do this because they don't actually have people naturally commenting on these videos, so it's a sign of electoral weakness.

Content: <@&1250537336639586325> I was on both (parts 1 and 2) training calls for Online Engagement over a week ago and I never received the slides and all the links that were dropped in the chat. I ALWAYS check spam and junk folders as well as Apple Mail blocked addresses and phone numbers. Why am I not getting the post-training e-mails? My guess is that the campaign itself blocked my e-mail ( joecarrtexas@comcast.net ) sometime in the past...maybe in response to me trying to limit dozens of e-mails each day from past Biden Harris e-mails. Can somebody go unblock my e-mail so that I can get the slides and links that are promised to me after I attend a training session? Thanks!

Content: I've been in technology for the majority of my life (I'm 57 and have been involved with tech since I was 10, so that should give you an idea). When Obama ran for President, I told people he was going to win, and win big, because not only did he have a better message, but because he recognized early on how to use social media to his advantage. I think that in 2016, Trump won because he figured it out and utilized it better than Hillary did. This year, I am BLOWN AWAY at how the Harris campaign is taking it to new heights by getting all of us involved. Trump is a social media organization of one (two if you count Elon). For fun, I went to the volunteer sites for both campaigns. The difference, like everything else, is stark and, like Obama, beyond having a better message, we are kicking *ss when it comes to social media engagement - and that's what's going to give us our first female President! This campaign is definitely where joy comes to live.

Content: Thanks for the suggestion, but getting to the mobilize settings screen requires using a my Google/gmail account, my Facebook account or a magic link sent to my e-mail, BUT... 1) The magic link never appears in my joecarrtexas@comcast.net inbox or spam folder, 2) using the Facebook account does NOT work, and 3) my main e-mail is my Comcast e-mail, not my Google gmail. My Discord account is my Comcast e-mail. Do I have to somehow create a whole new Mobilize account using my Comcast e-mail? Maybe my Mobilize acct was set up years ago with my Google gmail.

Content: <@1184187512491618404> Yes, I heard that it amplifies and raises the creators engagement in the algorithm. Can you confirm which  is best if it  is your own YT or TT? 
  1. Counter the information in your comments to your video. I heard it increases your algorithm so your video is shown to more people.

 2. block or delete suspected bad actors, trolls, bots? 

 3. Or are you better to leave the misinformation alone.so it does not amplify, no matter what, even if it is applying in the thousands?

Content: Collecting this data could also be used once Harris & Walz are in office to inform policy in re: Data Privacy, Cyber Security, and the refinement of Section 230. Kinda need to know the topography/landscape beyond corporations handwaving and asking to regulate themselves.

To get a feel for the disconnect between where we are vs. what these companies are telling us vs. policy, I invite anyone to read Ch. 7 of P2025 (the section on Cyber and Intelligence) and download the text of the TikTok Ban bills, which didn't pass.

Anyone in tech and with a grasp of the basics, both are like badly written Bond Novels with consolidation of power under Trump.

Content: For TT,
1) works 
2) not sure 
3) definitely don't comment on or watch or reply to or repost disinfo videos. You want to tap-hold and choose "report" then choose "misinformation". If it's just dumb talking points but not disinfo, you can pick "not interested" instead.

<@1270181490227155029> this was supposed to be a reply, sorry.

Content: For YT:
1) I have no evidence this does anything. (If someone else does lmk)
2) Yes, this is effective on your own videos. For other people's videos, you want to thumbs down and report any comments on their vids (ideally after collecting data). For disinfo videos you want to make sure you don't watch more than 20 seconds of the video, report. But don't thumbs down the video (that's engagement)
3) Leaving it alone is a solid option if you don't have time or are exhausted. Collecting the url of the video would be helpful.

Content: This is likely a coordinated disinfo attack. Literally everything is not just false but ridiculously so. Unfortunately some of MAGA are too far gone and actually believe this kind of stuff.

I wouldn't be surprised if this was meant simultaneously to distract us, make us mad at our fellow citizens, and activate the worst and most corrupted of MAGA.

Mostly, my advice is: just don't panic. And, if you really want to do something, take some screenshots and send them to a disinformation/IT/security reporter.

Content: Hi Skye - Thanks for the suggestion about trying to subscribe to Mobilize, but Mobilize does not show me a "subscribe" option. Here is what I did: I first opened Mobilize in my browser and it already had me logged in on my gmail account. I then logged out of Mobilize so I could look for a subscribe button or option so I could set up an account using my Comcast e-mail account, BUT there was no subscribe button or option. Somehow when I take a training session in Mobilize, I never get an e-mail in either e-mail account... not even in my gmail-based Mobilize account which has settings set for me to receive e-mails via gmail after events. This has been really frustrating. Also for some reason, when I sign up for a Mobilize event, I only get the links by text and NEVER by e-mail.

Content: Thanks. Guide sounds interesting. If you're suggesting that I supply some data on clips I've watched, to help your effort along, LMK. Couldn't tell, but would be happy to pull together a spreadsheet. Mainly I watch livestreams, preferring PBS as it turns comments off. But for local events it varies, and I like to post Likes on duplicates, mostly for the optics.

Content: Hello,

Can anyone direct me to a person I can speak to regarding: cyber bullying

Content: this is so ridiculous it's one of those funny, not funny moments.  It is purposefully written like a stump speech so that it's like swatting at flies.  My dad use to say, don't stay so busy swatting at flies that you miss the alligator snapping at your ankle.   In the combatting misinformation training... a quick overview... use the ABC method...Acknowledge the Fear..... (There is a lot of stoking the flames of fear here but seems the central theme is around Illegal Immigrants),  B bridge the concern....C Counter message  " I understand Illegal immigration and border safety and control is important and it is concerning to all Americans including the democrats.  (B) What's important to remember  (C) is that a bill to protect the boarders had bi-partisan support and only recently failed in congress because Former President Trump reached out to his supporters and instructed them to vote no so that it would help his campaign. This ultimately put the country at risk for political gain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   There is also material in the reach app that you can use to support this.   on a funnier note....demrats eat magats üòÇ  gotta laugh to keep from crying

Content: <@398213142188130305> <@1277032945290580102> The thing about Whatsapp is that it's super widespread among Indian, European, and some Hispanic communities. Especially if they've immigrated to the US only within the last decade or so.

Content: Those long posts are long intentionally. The length usually fills up the whole chat window  or a cell phone screen and are usually used to intentionally derail a conversation.  You can't win by arguing with those head on, so I suggest either responding with a meme mocking the poster -or- posting something that's either more "shocking" or funnier to derail that post.

- Puts them on notice
- Puts them on blast
- Calls them a child
- Implies that they should be banned from the chat for being that childish/stupid

Content: Also keep in mind that meme is a very tame PG version of what is possible to respond with. If they start really going at it in chat trying to derail everything, I strongly suggest going significantly raunchier (within reason, of course).

Like "how would Austin Powers respond to this".

Content: What gets lost in the shuffle is there was heavy defense investment during The Space Race of the 1960s + the Cold War, specifically with launching things into orbit and how to maintain comms should then-traditional means be interrupted.

This thing we're using to organize was an old DARPA/ARPA answer to those questions.

Content: BIG OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE MODERATES
I could use help engaging with people on Lex Fridman‚Äôs Youtube podcasts page to politely push back on Lex‚Äôs interview with Donald Trump. Lex has 4.17 MILLION subscribers, 1.64 MILLION views of his interview with Trump and over 34,000 comments on this episode on Youtube since the interview was posted 9 hours ago. Lex's audience has MANY moderates, although most of the comments so far are supportive of the Trump interview. The moderate viewers who regularly watch or listen to Lex are probably a bit shy to comment against the Trump interview, so I think it would be helpful if volunteers from our online engagement team chime in on the Youtube page for this episode to politely criticize Lex for failing to push back on some of Trump‚Äôs major lies and to educate people commenting on the interview.

Here is the link: https://youtu.be/qCbfTN-caFI

To see my comments, look for my @joec143 Google handle. I politely criticized Lex for his failure to push back more aggressively on these topics:

- Trump suggestion that Hillary Clinton should have been sent to prison.

- Trump calling the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù.

- No push back on Trump saying he knew nothing about Project 2025.

- No push back on Trump blaming Biden for the messed up withdrawal from Afghanistan, ignoring Trump‚Äôs role in that mess.

- No push back on Trump killing the bipartisan immigration bill because he needed to use the wedge issue to get votes.

- No probing on Trump‚Äôs Dec 2020-Jan 2021 conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.

 Lex also wants to interview Kamala Harris, which I think would be good.

Content: I see a few of you are having issues with posting content from Reach to Threads. Let me help. This is a screenshot from the Windows app but this applies to any version of Reach. Look for the download icon, click/tap it and save the content to your device. Then you're going to go into the platform in question (X, Threads, FB) and use the same features you would use to upload a photo or a video. Hope this helps.

Content: GA‚Äôs Deadly School Shooting. Another tragedy today ‚Äì We have a chance to start posting now about Kamala's incredible work on school safety and gun violence.  Attached is a summary I made from a long policy statement from the White House.  Republicans are likely to repeat ‚Äòprayers and thoughts‚Äô and that it‚Äôs too early to talk policy ‚Äì look for likely David Hogg's statement and parents of victims saying this IS the time to talk policy.
Also, Dr. on msnbc this hour says GA has very poor gun laws. Everytown says GA is a "national failure" https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/

Content: All this disinfo stuff is coming to another early crest. New CNN report that we're getting official announcements from the government soon on an RT disinfo campaign.

I don't think it's worth posting since the announcement is coming later today and we'll have more and better reporting then.

There is, predictably, a Russian disinfo firehose directed at the video, which I found amusing.

As you receive our thoughts & prayers, let's also take a hard look at our laws. GA has no safe storage or red flag laws. These can save lives. As head of the WH Office of Gun Violence Prevention, Kamala Harris is working hard to encourage such laws. With Biden, she has implemented many policies & policy recommendations to help keep our students safe. https://bit.ly/4ec32KY https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/

Content: For today's icebreaker (posted in <#1250551051002839131> ): What is your favorite part of Fall? 

My favorite part of Fall is the change of the season that can be felt with the crisp coldness in the air in the mornings, the warm smell of pumpkin pie spice in coffee shops, etc.

Content: Cool story this morning! I live in a neighborhood where a lot of Trump supporters proudly fly their MAGA flags. I took a risk by openly supporting Kamala Harris, both online and by displaying political statements at my house. Today, after dropping my kid off at school, a neighbor I‚Äôd never spoken to pulled me aside and said, ‚ÄòWe LOVE your Kamala Harris flags!‚Äô

That moment reminded me‚Äîit only takes ONE person to stand up for what they believe in. Many of us feel the same way but are afraid to speak up. Today, I got confirmation that I will NEVER stay silent. Let‚Äôs get it done! üíôüá∫üá∏üí™üèΩ

Content: I had a long conversation with my daughter-in-law. She lives in a deep, deep Trump country area in PA.  She is a thoughtful, kind person who is no longer listening to anything abut either candidate. She said she hates the negativity of Trump and wants someone who has positive solutions to offer. But when I asked if she watched anything about Kamala, she said no and she won't because both parties are liars. It's this attitude that worries me the most.

Content: Actually I listened to her and found out that much of their former support for Trump and I fear still, even though she says she won't vote for either, is that my son is a 50 yo white male who has worked for DOD for 0ver 30 years after spending 10 years in the Navy. She said, in tears, that he has been passed over for promotions 5-6 times in the last 6 years and the jobs went to unqualified DEI candidates. She said he feels totally void of all value. Her pain was real .We love each other very much and have agreed that politics will not change that. She and I have always validated each other's feelings.  Feelings aren't right or wrong, they just are. There's nothing I can do to convince her. It's just that I wonder how many others there are like her. And because she is the only one in the family who supports Trump that is willing to talk to me genuinely, I now have a better understanding of some of the Trump folks.

Content: I am excited about the small business platform plank. I have been wondering how Democrats  could win back the rural voters. Small town America wants our downtowns to have small businesses, medical care available and internet services. I think the Harris campaign is caring about all three.

Content: Try engaging with the community you want to post it in for a couple of days by commenting, upvoting (or downvoting) and otherwise doing community things. It should remove the bot-ness the (ironically probably) bot-mods are applying to your account. Often there are karma and other requirements for specific communities in addition to account level ones for reddit automoderation.

I don't have any other ideas for places that might get traction with long form content.

Content: That's my real sadness. That she's so turned off by the whole thing that she won't even give Kamala a chance. However, their entire group of friends are Trumpers. I posted a meme about all the things Trump did before the Afghanistan withdrawal with 2 backup sources and said these were the facts. Their best friend came back with "Not facts!!"  What can I do? Move on to someone that might have an open mind.

Content: Hey everyone, I‚Äôd like to introduce myself! I‚Äôm DC Shepard and I run the channel History Flights Productions with 1303 TikTok followers and 28 YouTube subscribers. I mostly post about video games but also do political content, collated in this playlist for everyone to see. My highest viewed TikTok video accurately predicting the 2022 midterms got 70k views on TikTok and a video talking about the global ramifications of the election when Biden was still in got 952 views. I plan on making a livestream this weekend inside of Microsoft Flight Simulator talking about the dizzying amount of historical events in this race at a high level between July and now before the debate, and would appreciate any technical advice on simulcasting to TikTok, Twitch and YouTube.

Content: I went to the training say this, not that. They suggest you reach them w a positive emotional appeal and avoid proving them wrong. I think they're right about that. There's something called the backfire effect when you prove someone wrong.  They recommend we give up on Trumpers. We can't help them.

Content: Just wanted to share a tactic that I've seen work and had work with the whole Walz family endorsing trump thing.  You respond by saying how this just shows how Walz is even more like the rest of us in America.  Many have lost friends and family and have been divided because of a man who tries to overthrow our government once and will do it again in a heartbeat.   Then share your story about friends or family you've lost due to Trump.  It's really impactful and flips the script.

Content: Once you start highlighting the things and the reasons for the division and emphasize how it was the GOP who caused that division by putting the very existence of fellow Americans against each other because of who they are and the impact it has had on you and your family really seems to hit home.

Content: Here's why relational organizing in the digital sphere is important.  We need to counter the false narrative of the opposition and we do so with our trusted voice with the folks in our networks.  I'm from Western PA.  If we vote, we win.  Our people hold the key and we need to be engaged and ready to get out the vote.  That means constant contact for the next 60 days.  I've had friends say that I'm posting too much political stuff, and ten times as many friends have countered this claim with encouragement to do even more posting.  We also need to engage our friends in conversation and get them engaged.  I've now had over 500 conversations with people in my network confirming their vote and encouraging them to download REACH and get to work.  So far, over 30 of my friends have downloaded the app and are doing organizing for the campaign.  I am reaching out in my neighborhood, in my faith groups, in my social groups, and in my political groups.  I will leave no stone unturned in my networks.  We are the ones we've been waiting for.  If we don't want Agent Orange in the White House destroying democracy and threatening our children's future and our present, the time for engagement is NOW.  Let's get our friends and family on REACH and help them to use their voice in the digital sphere and in face-to-face conversations with their friends.

Content: It may be that the other friends seeing your post with facts will take notice and do a little research.  Outspoken MAGA are too invested at this point to change, no one wants to feel like they were foolish enough to be scammed, but their friends will also see your posts.  It's actually easier to reply with empathy when you know and care about the person, as you do.

Content: Thanks. Someone told me once I was too condescending, so I do try and have a different approach now. The funny thing is while I don't get any likes or comments on my posts  friends in GA, FL and AZ have started reposting my posts.

Content: I have wondered since 2010 who is in control of making decisions in Shelby County is it Steve Cohen or Mayor Strickland and I wonder if Steve Cohen ever supported Donald Trump as well for things to go so sour and for our physical beings to feel like after a affliction or trauma that we are to continue to struggle and suffer and to withhold necessary benefits and information for the personal individual to move to move forward...it's open because for him to donate 300,000 towards victims but for the withheld information to not be considered for the individual victims to have the perpetrator apprehended and the material such as police cameras to not be considered or even looked upon and then have a timeline to were nothing can be identified is a inside job...

Also don't see how I post something new on IG (so that I could c&p the image).  The + said "New Highlight" which doesn't appear to get me to a new post.

Content: I wrote an article on Medium about how people can help Kamala and Democrats win this November, but it won't do any good unless it gets read!  I don't write a whole lot, so I don't have many followers or anything like that.  I just found all this information and compiled it in a way that I thought people would find inspiring and approachable.  Can I get some help to promote this?  I'm hoping if people read it it will bring in money and volunteers for the campaigns.  https://medium.com/@peterst28/getting-democrats-elected-when-we-fight-we-win-11f92f57af40

Content: I need some help. I took the training where we talked about acknowledge, bridge and counter. I need suggestions on how. I posted about Trump and Project 2025 and got a response "Trump is NOT supporting Project 2025." Just that. I started with saying to her I understand there are millions who agree with you. And I know that all of us are concerned  about the future of our country. Now I'm stuck on what to say next to do the bridge part. Any ideas?

Content: When I post stuff to facebook or linkedin or x or my email groups, I'm looking for friends to have a conversation with.  Sometimes, its a message conversation on fb or linkedin or an email where a person confirms their support.  When I confirm their support, I want to encourage them to do online organizing using REACH and DISCORD, really mostly REACH.  As I assess my networks, I'm especially looking for people who have extensive personal networks, and are active on the platform.  These are folks who can amplify messages and encourage others to get engaged.  My goal is to get folks to participate.  As Michelle Obama said, "DO SOMETHING."  We have to do this NOW as there is no time to waste.  The opposition has a strong foothold in PA (where I'm doing my organizing) and we need to find those people and networks in our strongholds of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and especially surrounding suburbs in these two urban areas.  We're told that those suburbs hold the key to victory.  Let's find our peeps there and move them into action.

Content: I'm a whiskey drinker and tonight, we will have a Whiskey Sip 'n Share Fundraiser for Kamala and Tim.  We have $5K in and counting.  Those who show up will have their pick of 22 beautiful whiskies from around the world:  bourbons from Kentucky, Whiskies from the center of the Whisky Universe - Islay, exquisite Japanese and Irish Whiskies, and specially crafted stuff from Australia.  This event was a part of my "relational organizing" process.  I needed to have something folks could rally around in my community and my emails/contacts of this group (especially those who stepped up to be hosts at higher giving levels) are now my targets for more engagement online.  Many have downloaded REACH.  I will get more to do so tonight.

Content: YouTube has a playlist of [Reach tutorials](https://www.reach.vote/knowledge-base/category/guides/video-guides/).  People who have completed a Reach training are familiar with the first two parts of the playlist.  Part 5 is relational organizing, which is what you're doing.  If your contacts do the same relational organizing, then Reach's user base will expand to your contacts' networks.

Content: Exactly.  I have not yet organized a personal REACH training but I've been thinking about doing so for my immediate friends, neighbors and contacts in Pittsburgh.  I also have groups of folks who might be interested.  Sometimes, it's hard to get folks motivated to attend the campaign's trainings.  I might be able to make it a bit easier for them to get on board.

Content: I spoke with an amazing Democrat in Nevada. His family had the misfortune of being stiffed by Trump in the building of Trump's short lived Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. He is a blue dot in an extremely red area. HIs neighbors, including many seniors, are very anti-government and for that reason, even against their own self interest, support Trump. HIS MESSAGING SUGGESTION: We need to address this anti-government sentiment if we ever want to break through to these people. Those who benefit/depend on Social Security, Medicare if they are older or approaching retirement. Those that used the GI Bill for service members to go to college, like Coach Walz and JD Vance. Those that receive food assistance. FEMA and the National Guard to help recover from disasters and rebiuld communities, etc.

Content: My dad worked a construction job that had ties to Trump and he said about the same things. Also, I have a friend from college who is from Atlantic City and he told me a lot about Trump that was very negative. I only wish these messages got through to others.

Content: As do I. Maybe using Coach Walz recitation of the policies Trump would enact and Walz's question, "Who asked for this?"  would help to get through to anti-government people.

Content: I have a pretty small network (introvert, what can I say?) but I've been posting snippets here and there from whatever campaign volunteering I'm doing and have had three different people reach out to me privately asking for more info on how they can get involved too. Every little bit helps and you don't know when you're going to reach someone at the right moment.

Content: Looking forward to the Online Lead Interest Meeting later this afternoon. Not sure if I can post the Zoom link here, so I will just include the email for now. If you have any questions, you can email digitalorganizing@dnc.org. Hopefully, there will be multiple sessions. I think this is my first post in this channel, so by way of introduction, I post content in an official group FB Harris for Texas as mod, and in LGBT for Harris, an unofficial group, as a member.

The biggest gap is 208k plus which isn‚Äôt exactly middle income hehe

Content: The author's point is that these ads need to be countered directly by reliable sources. Just saying Trump did something similar won't help (imo) because people are already overloaded with hearing about all the awful things he has done, is doing, and will do if he can.

Content: Even the NYTimes is pointing out Trump's continued connection to Project 2025: "Former President Donald J. Trump vowed to vastly reshape the federal bureaucracy on Saturday in a wide-ranging, often unfocused speech at a rally in Wisconsin.

He pledged to ultimately eliminate the Department of Education, redirect the efforts of the Justice Department and fire civil servants charged with carrying out Biden administration policies that he disagreed with.

[***]

Many of the proposals in Mr. Trump‚Äôs speech align with plans reported by The New York Times to conduct a broad expansion of presidential power over government, and to effectively concentrate more authority within the White House, if he wins in November.

And many of his pledges dovetailed with the stated goals and proposals of Project 2025, an effort by a group of conservative organizations to develop policies for the next Republican president. "

Content: Hi all: there's someone on this Reddit thread asking "what can I do to help?" after pointing out that swing states are getting lots of outreach. I didn't take the online engagement training for various reasons so apologies if responding to such comments is out of scope, but I didn't want to respond if there's boilerplate for situations like these (also, I'm only a Reddit reader).  https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fc32z8/comment/lm59gih/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

Content: Hi again, well after arguing that attacking Trump on this kind of thing wouldn't help, somebody went out and dug up a bunch of highly relevant information. I stand corrected! Trump has let all kinds of crazed criminals back into society, only to have them commit more crimes! Here is the article - hopefully this information can be shared far and wide! https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/9/8/2268629/-Let-s-Turn-the-Tables-on-Trump-s-Willie-Horton-Style-Attacks-on-Kamala?pm_campaign=front_page&pm_source=trending&pm_medium=web

Content: RE: Covering daily rants: "Fox News" used to cover his events full coverage, since they started cutting away someone (on, I think it was MSNBC) wondered if their news network should start covering them, and let people hear.  I think those are probably more deserving of coverage , than the shouting into the void he has been doing on Twitter for over a dozen years. I did not think we think we should platform him then, when he said he teased he would shortly have an important announcement; and what was then revealed regarding the whole birth certificate thing did not seem like enough of a major announcement.  They do read his rants occasionly on Morning Joe on MSNBC . Who still watches network news, (aside from retired persons, some who may not even know there is an election), with CBS benching Nora O'Donnell, according to Katie Couric? I don't know about local news. I'd be surprised if they showed him in context, changing the subject to tarrifs and inanity such as "Child care is child care ."  However CNN, and MSNBC devoted time to this & the "weave", the same week as the Harrisburg Town Hall on Hannity.

Content: They recently posted a contact us on the official Kamala-Walz site. See if maybe we could send them some feedback to counter this type of ad?

Content: <@188697047153508353> They have a contact us section on their official website, with a category listed as "feedback." I think for us as something we can do, we can send a message to them asking to keep their advertisement team ontop of ads such as this one, and how critical it was to Bush's victory back in the year 200. Al Gore was just 500 votes short of winning Florida, and his failure in this was likely due to ads like the one mentioned above.

Content: I haven't seen anything that saucy from the official Harris-Walz resources. Demcast is independent. And While it's not a great joke,  I think the joke is meant to make people feel seen rather than called out.

Content: To all online engagers;

There is going to be an unreasonable amount of misinformation relating to the debate.

During the DNC, Elon Musk ran ads calling Kamala a communist with a radical agenda. He will do the same with the debate, and that‚Äôs the tip of the iceberg.

Let‚Äôs kick it into overdrive for the next few days in particular

Content: <@&1250537336639586325> Kamala HQ posted a great new video ad on X recently, but shouldn't I be able to find it on YouTube or Reach? I can't find it. I don't want to post the X link on Facebook because Facebook would not show the graphic representing the video (it just shows an "X.com" link). Why wouldn't the Kamala Harris YouTube page show ALL video ads including those from The Lincoln Project and other supporting groups? Please advise how I can find a simple link that shows a graphic. Thank you!  Here is the X link. Can somebody point me to a Youtube link? https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1833137013240848687

Content: Have you seen this? Are you aware of this activity? I myself have responded to somebody who challenged me online and I did receive one citation for hate speech immediately after and I assure you I never use hate speech; and I once reposted a liberal creators content and received another warning for violation of content which I now think might have been a bot also. So there may be some truth to this and we should all be aware. We cannot afford to lose our online presence this close to the election. Please be careful!

Content: Thanks for the heads up, CricketMom!

It's not just you. Some of the more popular lives and progressive-leaning creators are being mass reported. For example, The Meidas Touch Network's official TT page was just restored via community outreach and behind-the-scenes legal scuffling.

The Good News: Should you receive a CGV, you can appeal and, more often than not, the content will be restored.

The Meh News: Even the best of us might forget to use softer/alternate language for "adult" themes or subjects in the heat of the moment. Examples of alternative language can include: Unaliving, the skull emoji, the water gun emoji or pew-pew, self-deletion, pig latin, and/or smooshing syllables.

Lastly, take heart! The candidate campaign has had at least 18-months to prepare for the run so it may seem overwhelming or more organized (SPOILER: They're not); compare that with what we've cobbled together in a handful of weeks.

We got this! We keep going.

Content: Hi! I‚Äôm excited about President Harris! But want to make sure my online efforts are helpful!

I join many Tik Tok Lives and join panels  encouraging people to vote for her and debating her policies. 

Many people are just trolling. But some people say we have changed their minds. Obviously, who knows whats true. 

Many questions are:
Is there in data that shows how TT can be impactful in elections?

If so, how?

What age is the most difficult from the campaign to reach?

Content: i honestly worry/pity him. knowing what i know from seeing what i've seen, there was a time he was a jovial, happy child. now he seems hollow, like a puppet that repeats what it hears. i think as he grew up, that happy child was reduced down to what we see now, which is a man that struggles to connect to the world around him and fixates on what he knows -- an old 50's image of a 'traditional nuclear family' that doesn't really exist.

Content: How are we responding to Trump saying it is "CHEATING" to use podium steps/lifts? This obviously seems like an attempt by Trump to control a narrative that Kamala is a cheater so if they appear to be the same height from the outset of the debate his followers will already be engaged in a lie with him. This seems like an appropriate thing to call out and get ahead of. Is there any place to find the oofficial campaign messaging on this topic? I also cannot see it mentioned anywhere on the ABC website so I am assuming this was not an agreed upon rule.

Content: Haitians in Springfield OH: Thanks for the posts and fact checks. I pushed back on a Heritage Foundation post today that said Kamala brought Haitians here illegally. Here are my responses: Here's some good news - it turns out that reports of crimes by Haitians in Springfield are not true. Deputy Dir of Public Safety says: I think it's sad that some people are using this as an opportunity to spread hate or spread fear. We get these reports 'the Haitians are killing ducks in a lot of our parks' or 'the Haitians are eating vegetables right out of the aisle at the grocery store'. And we haven't really seen any of that. It's really frustrating. As a community, it's not helpful as we try to move forward. https://npr.org/2024/08/12/nx-s1-5055784/immigration-vance-trump-migration-president-migrants-election-ohio

Hi @Heritage - here's some info you might want to think about. Amidst the challenges of accommodating so many new neighbors, some Republicans think the GOP messaging on immigration & jobs is "way off base." Republican CEO of a Springfield plant says: "I think this whole notion of migrants taking American jobs is hogwash. That's spoken like a true person that has never made a payroll or tried to, you know, run a business.‚Äù His company was profoundly affected by labor shortages & 30 new Haitian workers were vital to filling the gap. ‚ÄúI mean, the fact of the matter is, without the Haitian associates that we have, we had trouble filling these positions.‚Äùhttps://npr.org/2024/08/12/nx-s1-5055784/immigration-vance-trump-migration-president-migrants-election-ohio

Content: Here is another response I gave today --[ note that most people don't know unauthorized migrants pay lots in taxes without getting the benefits]:   The Feds used U.S. law (Code ¬ß1254a) to give non-criminal Haitians Temporary Protected Status (TPS). DHS determined in 2021: ‚ÄúHaiti is currently experiencing serious security concerns, social unrest, an increase in human rights abuses, crippling poverty & lack of basic resources.‚Äù TPS was extended because Haiti is ruled by violent gangs. I hope you'll find compassion for the people of Haiti.  As for being a burden, migrants help our economy mightily ‚Äì doing work unwanted by others & paying billions in taxes each year.  https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1254a&num=0&edition=prelim  https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024/#:~:text=Key%20Findings,to%20state%20and%20local%20governments

Content: Hey everybody. I have an intuition about how to win this thing and it's real simple. 

STOP SAYING T***P. DON'T SAY HIS NAME. EVER. JUST DON'T.  Call him Donald, Donny, Don, the former president, 45, the sex convict, the distinguished felon from New York, the man who's name sounds like plump,... whatever, just do not ever say his name. 

It's a brand created by grandpa Drumpf. He puts it on everything. It's on the top of buildings written in our skylines. It is his ego writ large and the most important thing to him. 

You and I have the power to take that away from him by refusing to speak it. Attention is the currency of our age and everytime you say his name you are paying him.

If we all stop using the T word, he will go nuts and make a mistake. The algorithms will suddenly stop promoting him as much if the name drops in usage. It won't come up as much in search if no one is saying it. 

He has reduced politics to a simple name recognition contest. Take that name away and he's nothing. 

I guarantee if Kamala doesn't say the T word once in the debate, she wins, and he will be visibly shaken. 

Your voice is your power. His name is his power. Use your silence to end his violence. 
Never say T....

Content: Connie Shultz, the wife of our Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, reposted a piece on Facebook by David Dewitt writer for the Ohio Capital Journal about Vance and Springfield and the Haitians. It's a wonderful take down of Vance and his lies.

Content: Has anyone (on Twitter) noticed that they are being followed by fake accounts? I‚Äôve had at least one a day follow me. 
They‚Äôre all made to look like young women. 
But the only posts they share are pictures of women in thongs and bikinis. 

I was going to block them, but I thought I‚Äôd ask here if anyone else had this experience and how they handled it.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to reshare items on Mastodon. So far I've arrived at a combo of screenshots and links, like in this post: https://mastodon.social/@kzeta/113113897203227864

Go ahead and block them.

It is more than likely these are some combination of bots and romance scam accounts.

Content: Hi CMoney!

This is a good opportunity to ask some follow up questions and figure out what is important to the responder.

For example: Ask them in what ways their life has been more difficult under the Biden/Harris administration. Don't be afraid to ask them to get specific about policy.

Sometimes, they'll list off a bunch of things right off the bat (or try to steam roll you). Another technique is to ask them which is the most important or to take the points one at a time.

From there, apply the ABCs (Acknowledge their concern, Bridge with facts, Connect with a story of your own).

Lastly, you may find that folks are a little fuzzy on how our government works and what the VP is consitutionally empowered to do.

Good Luck!

Content: Speaking with someone online who was spouting off about the ‚ÄúHaitian immigrant crisis in Springfield Ohio‚Äù posting easily refuted information. Tried to dispute everything they said with easily verifiable facts and got hit with ‚ÄúWhy do you keep parroting leftist msm talking points‚Äù. Which on one hand makes me laugh that they are back door admitting to indisputable fact being a ‚Äútalking point‚Äù. But also really makes me realize how much this election means and how hard we will have to fight to get the message out to the very few people left who can see reason and be swayed.

Content: NGL: It can be exhausting having these conversations and witnessing the disconnect in (or near) real time. It can feel like a broken record or running on a treadmill (and not getting anywhere).

More often than not, these are teachable moments to those who are reading along or watching silently in the background. If nothing else, the exchange provides a counter-example of a behavior no one wants.

What helps me is to remember I am speaking to someone who is scared and when we're scared, it's really tough to take a beat and think things through.

Depending upon who it is, I have had some success getting really granular and breadcrumbing those steps away from fear to something a little more balanced.

It's a dance between outreach and protecting your peace.

I get by with frequent breaks and lots of snacks

Content: It‚Äôs so exhausting. It often doesn‚Äôt help I purposely ‚Äúwade into the deep end‚Äù as it were with the folks I choose to engage with online. But they are the loudest and my hope is like you said. Going after the most extreme seems to be the loudest way to be heard. And hopefully someone else who reads or listens to what I‚Äôm saying hears something they need to. It‚Äôs just unfortunate that it seems you have to engage with the biggest extremes to try and actually have any reach in what you say.

Content: Honestly it helps that I used to be the kind of person who loved to start/jump into an internet flame war and just go in hard and fast. Definitely modified my approach as I‚Äôve gotten smarter about politics and the internet. But that ability/drive to go in at any time helps me keep up the drive to try and spread the word far and wide.

Content: yep, same. after some good mental health development, i realized that a lot of shouting doesn't really teach anyone anything, but being calm when someone else is screaming is _also_ surprisingly ineffective

but every once in a while you find someone who's wanting to listen, but might be too afraid to ask. or might be politically illiterate (as is most people i'd imagine). i found my best success with those who had a specific concern/minority and addressing that to get them interested.

Content: Hey, not to go all California hippie woo woo on everyone, but can I suggest that we all here try today to reflect and refract positive energy and put that out as what VP Harris has as the psychic force to counter the (yes exhausting) negging of the other side? Or you could call it a prayer if that's more your thing. But maybe just until the debate is over we could have conversations about joy and loving our country? From a physics perspective, you want to amplify a message by adding sound waves tovether. So we want her to have positive messages that she's amplifying to the rest of the country. We know who he is. Maybe they don't know who she is. We can talk about difficulty after the debate (I don't want to minimize reality). But for now, she can preach to the choir, we amplify her message. We can sing, she can amplify our voice. Maybe people could add a prayer or a joyous positive message?

Content: And now they are using their made up problem to point attention to "the Haitian Immigrant Problem" that they want to offer solutions to as well: https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/local/dewine-pledges-funding-law-enforcement-to-address-springfield-haitian-immigrant-influx/KX2GV33R7JBYZLGE3M5NMPNFEI/ That would be our Republican Governor (DeWine)

That said, if not enough resources are being given, that would be on the Republican Party here for not addressing the issue and Ohio is a Republican Trifecta state (meaning the Governor, Ohio House Majority, and Ohio Senate Majority are ALL under Republican Control) So if there is a problem, they created it by not assessing and taking care of the problem previous to this.

Content: I don‚Äôt even know how to use discord but saw an amazing idea in a group that I shared in all my dem groups and on my personal page:

Just saw a FANTASTIC idea for a debate game that can make a REAL impact in saving our democracy and wanted to share. IF you‚Äôre able, commit to donating $1 (even $0.01 per lie would add up) to either Kamala‚Äôs or any Democratic campaign for EVERY SINGLE lie trump tells tonight. If you‚Äôre not able to donate monetarily, maybe commit to 30 minutes of time helping Democratic campaigns per lie - just #dosomething! We will NOT go back! Let‚Äôs do this, y‚Äôall! üíôüíô

Content: There are some nice new additions to the store but only one thing that says ‚ÄúNot Going Back‚Äù and that is a men‚Äôs muscle shirt. I‚Äôm a 70 yrs old woman. I would settle for sticker with it but you don‚Äôt have that, so I give up. I will go make my donation and not buy anything. I have a Biden-Harris shirt and a Harris-Walz shirt. Really wanted something with ‚Äúnot going back‚Äù cause this is my 2nd time around fighting for o women‚Äôs rights to health care.  So thank you for the new additions but if they are gonna add more please add NOT GOING BACK.
Thanks. ü§çü©∑üíô

Content: I‚Äôll post here too in case anyone isn‚Äôt looking in the community notes channel.
If you are having conversations with folks talking about ‚Äúear piece earring feeding Kamala answers‚Äù.
She was wearing a pair of Tiffany and Co that she has worn many times in the past. NOT some high tech earpiece gizmo earrings. Here is an image of the pair she was wearing:

Content: Taylor Swift: I joined 34,000 others on the 2-hour Swifties for Kamala National Call 2 weeks ago. When asked if I'm a Swiftie, I simply say isn't everyone cray-cray for Tay-Tay?!
Here is a video of the call  https://youtu.be/r9lQlWzQLPQ  
Speakers & The Minute They Appear on the Video [missing some regional organizers near end]
Sen. Elizabeth Warren 11:58
Rep. Becca Balint ‚Äì VT 16:00
Rep. Chris Deluzio PA 20:50
Carole King 28:00
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand NY 34:35
Kim McMurray from Indivisible explains ‚ÄúNeighbor to Neighbor‚Äù Program 41:18
Sen Ed Markey MA 45:38
Representative from ‚ÄúVote from Abroad‚Äù 1:16:30

Every one of the speakers is a committed Swiftie [including 78-year-old Ed Markey}. They each shared their favorite Swift songs and albums. 
Carole King talked about her friendship with Taylor & called herself Taylor‚Äôs grandmother.  I think a powerful video would be a compilation of 5-6 speakers telling about their Swiftie song favorites. Moderators -- please send this idea to Content Creators

Content: Not sure if this is where to ask for help but my friend is actively protesting against the genocide of Palestine and considers Harris a no-go for the issue. I know this is common thinking but today she called her a ‚Äúcop funded by Israel and will keep sending bombs to them for the genocide of the Palestinian people‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know how to engage with her on this. My biggest concern is that she won‚Äôt vote for anyone which will benefit Trump due to how our current system is structured and funded. Any tips on how to engage welcome!  I tried searching the chat but it just brought up Jill Stein stuff which isn‚Äôt relevant here. Thanks

Content: I definitely want to leave the floor open to other volunteers who I know are navigating similar conversations to share their tips and experiences, but I can offer a few thoughts! In general, keep in mind that our goal is to engage people who are unsure, need more information, or lean towards supporting Kamala and Democrats. It's okay to not engage here if you don't feel like the conversation will be productive. If you do choose to engage, I'd focus on sharing your personal reasons for supporting Kamala and emphasizing her dedication to moving our country forward -- opening up the opportunity for dialogue across international and domestic issues in a way that Trump has made clear will not happen if he's elected to a second term.

Content: Thanks. I guess I feel this approach won‚Äôt help because she hates trump and has zero interest to vote for him. And maybe that is enough? Maybe the third party / non vote for protest will not matter?

Content: If I may step in here because I'm rather worried about things. While this page has nothing about the Palestine issue, I do think everyone here should make themselves acquainted with the newly rolled out issues page on the campaign's website because it might help you with talking to friends about things. Also, watch some of the recaps of the debate and clips online and use what she said as talking points.

Content: I texted w/ my dad the entire debate. Mom and dad (80 yo) usually cancel out each other's vote. This year is different. Also, our oldest is ready to vote and is engaged...had their second debate watch party of the year last night with friends. So our little pocket of 4 voters (really just +2 for dem) just grew to 5 and all are aboard the Harris/Walz train!

I also texted a friend "who never votes" and said "Are you watching? We need you. NC is in play this year."

They were! And they are voting!

‚ÄúEven if they weren‚Äôt headphones she was still wearing $800 designer earrings. How can the average middle class American vote for someone who has the money to waste on such expensive jewlery‚Äù
The clapback:
‚ÄúWho can Americans relate to more. A late stage career professional wearing jewelry to the most important event in their life so far? Or a billionaire who lives in a country club mansion and owner of skyscrapers?‚Äù

Content: Answer to this: We didn't demand a rematch. We simply said we'd do it again if Trump is up for it. We need more light on you and your policies. That's why Harris invited the nation to attend YOUR rallies (hint: they'll leave early too).

Content: This is from my neighbor. Quite encouraging.

From my brother, a high school teacher in Pennsylvania...
I teach a Junior senior section of American government at 8 AM, and I had one student ask me how to register to vote, so I sent them the link and got 25 more asking for it.

I decided to innocently ask what their motivation was, and it was cross between the debate but mostly Taylor Swift got their attention.

Content: Good discussion on Reddit now:

https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/1fctszi/us_harris_voters_who_previously_voted_for_trump/

My fave comment there:
"Did you know that she bought the house next door to her so that secret service could be more comfortable and bring faMy fave mily? (cheatolini charged secret service in Trump Tower and when they couldn't afford it anymore they ended up in an RV on the street. Or how about how she used her leftover campaign money to provide healthcare for all the people who were suddenly out of a job (because she lost) The media made her out to be the wicked witch of the west when all she really was /is is often the smartest, most experienced person in the room."

^^^need to hear more of these ancedotes^^^

Content: Tell your friend it is either Harris or Trump. Sitting out means they DONT CARE AT ALL about Palestine. Then ask them to do their research and figure out which candidate's policies will ease global tensions so peace can be acheived. Which candidate unilaterally supports (the criminal) Benjamin Netanyahu's terror campaign? (hint: Trump. Biden and Harris admonished him)

Content: Hi Lorena!

May I suggest encouraging your friend to vote down ballot?

I also have some folks among my circles who are firm on a POTUS vote, but who are uncomfortable with not voting at all. I have had some traction explaining that a down ballot vote is a way to develop the next set of candidates while holding the current ones accountable.

Good Luck!

Content: These are conversations I‚Äôve struggled a lot with, too. In my social circles IRL and online, a LOT of my fellow left-leaning folks sneer ‚Äúboth parties are the same‚Äù and ‚Äúoh, so you‚Äôre just fine with xyz [insert objectionable policy]‚Äù when I explain why I‚Äôm 1000% committed to electing this ticket.  There‚Äôs that great quote about how our vote is an essential tool and not a love letter that has sort of resonated for some. I also try to just lay it out about how we have no choice but to operate in reality. We need to do what we can to help the greatest number of people possible, especially the most vulnerable, with our actions in this election. Always interested in tactics others have used, too!

Content: Taylor Swift:  Most Swifties may not know that Taylor endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in 2020. And they probably don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs said about Donald Trump.
I posted this on X-Twitter a couple weeks ago:  Hey @Swifties4 Kamala, you know Tay-Tay does not talk politics much. Do you know her talk of Trump? Trump stoked violence online during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. She responded: "After stoking the fires of white supremacy & racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? We will vote you out in November."  https://linktr.ee/swifties4kamala  https://bit.ly/3X3XFXy

Content: This is something that I thought maybe I should talk to you guys about since we are the ones that are working a lot with getting information out there online. But has anybody ever notice how it seems that people don't have this damn about how a bill becomes law? Reason why I'm saying this is because if you notice during the debate when Trump said to Harris about going down the Washington and getting joe to sign a thing to shut the border and what not which theoretically he could do with an executive order people think that that's all it takes to solve anything it's just for the president to sign a piece of paper when we all know that a large majority of the time you can't do anything without Congress. I was thinking about this because I just finished the phone bank for about an outreach group that I'm on the board of and a lady brought up about how a lot of people don't realize that with a lot of these laws and a lot of these bills and whatnot it takes Congress to approve them before the president signs off on them.

Content: I don't know any explicit messaging from the campaign on that, but he did have 4 years to pull out of Afghanistan and left it for Biden... and then used it as a political cudgel.

Harris said something during the debate yesterday: "And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century."

The fact that he lifted the Obama era restrictions on civilian casualties basically in every single case and almost started a hot war with Iran seem like good points to form a message around. Not sure how to form that beyond the mere facts. Data on additional civilian deaths I guess?

This Vox article might be helpful for anyone interested in crafting a message.

Content: This article brings up a lot of great points. I‚Äôve been thinking specifically about how Trump sent more trooos into Afghanistan, increased civilian casualties by 300%, increased drone strikes, pulled us out of Iran deal. It‚Äôs just easier to message these things if I had a graphic I could post on social media.

Content: In the first training I took today, we were encouraged to map our online communities.  Mine are mostly about gaming.  On Facebook and Reddit. These communities are vastly male, like me.  Unlike me, they are also vastly reactionary.  

If I go to the Reach library and just start bombing these groups with pro-Harris images, I will just get myself banned.

Clearly, that's not how it's done.  

I want to learn how, though. 

Can you offer me any particular guidance?

Content: You can keep an ear open when you see a blatant lie use Reach to find a counter argument. Additionally I've created a burner (account I don't care about) to retweet posts that are put out in the twitter community notes room (try to use hashtags when doing so)

Are they organizign themselves on a Discord channel?

Content: We prioritize our attention on engaging people/communities that are unsure, need more information, or lean towards supporting Kamala and Democrats in general. It protects your time, energy, and joy, and we know that we have the best chance of welcoming, informing, and persuading those individuals into supporting the Harris-Walz campaign. We don't want you to waste your energy going back and forth with trolls -- we're moving forward and we want to exemplify that with all the interactions we have <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Content: Good Day All ‚òÄÔ∏è
Last night debate was good! Trump showed his true self and when someone shows you who they are, BELIEVE IT. BELIEVE THEM. We all know our assignment. Vote BLUE all the way to the ballot box üó≥Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üíô

Trump never answered the debate questions. He didn't speak on his policies/plans for the future.  What he did do was attack America with fear, (crime, illegal border crossing, racism, division, discord, chaos, economy collapse, people eating dogs and cats, etc...). 
The world üåé will not collapse. America üá∫üá∏ will NOT fall apart as Trump spoke. Trump attacked America, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and others. Not one good thing did he speak on how to make America great. 
When we fight we Win!

Content: Oh really?. Cool! I found on the reach website on windows it's easier to take a partial screenshot with the snip it tool than it is to download the photo and then save it and then upload it to social media.  With the partial screenshot you just take a shot of the photo you need and then just paste it right to social media.  I've had a much easier time once I figured this out!

When there‚Äôs a once in a generation pandemic you have to let the processes process. Yall really out here about to let the increased price of a McMuffin cause you to vote for the worst President in history of democracy whose economic plans, or should I say his concepts of a plan, would REIGNITE INFLATION‚Ä¶. RELAX Biden and Kamala got us üòâüíô

Content: Periodic reminder while you're out there boosting content: mass amounts of negative comments that have seemingly too many upvotes too quickly on any platform means MAGA are scared, weak, and outnumbered, causing them to have directed a bot attack against that particular piece of media.

Don't lose hope and don't get distracted.

Content: I'm focusing my messaging on getting men to talk to each other as a strategy. In particular about Kamala and in particular about being proud to be a courageous hero who can use their vote to protect women's freedoms. Too cheesy? What do you think?

Content: My favorite online group for promoting Kamala Harris is Donald Trump Jail Tracker. (Facebook) They let me quickly post memes without having to add a descriptions. I can post directly from Reach without it having to be approved by their administrators, and best of all they let me post campaign donate media which I find on Kamala‚Äôs Facebook page.

Content: I think it's worth noting that the last time there was a gov't shutdown during an election season was during the Reagan administration, and the tables are completely turned from then.  It didn't work out well for Congress then, and I don't think it's going to work out for them now, either.

Content: Help from Mark Cuban on the tariff conversation. 
Please understand - Trump keeps saying he made billions off of China with the tariffs. That‚Äôs wrong, because the company in the US that imports the goods pays the tariff, not China. 
Anyway, here‚Äôs the post.

Content: Friend, the national polls don't matter. Only swing states do.  But in the last 2 elections, 2020 and 2022, the polls were wrong in swing states anywhere from 2-9% per NYTimes.  Anything could happen in this election. Anything. We have to work like we're behind 10%. Because no one knows. That's the truth.

Content: I have to say, the rhetoric around the Haitian community from this party is absolutely disgusting and simply racist ‚Äî it needs to be rebuffed and not normalized. I get it, it sounds ‚Äúfunny‚Äù. But it‚Äôs not to Haitians; a people who were systematically targeted for genocide in DR barely less than 70 years ago, even though they were the backbone of the sugar cane industry and allowed to work there. This is what Trump and his people do‚Äî They are the bullies

Content: looking at their site alone they're legitimate, but the text claiming to void state data isn't something a PAC can do.

not just block, i'd find a way to report that. it's misleading at best to claim power over someone's voter registration status then give a donation link like that's the only way to keep it.

Content: That message you received looks suspicious, especially with the urgent language and unfamiliar links. It's often a good idea to avoid clicking on any links or providing personal information in texts like that. Scammers sometimes use tactics like this to trick people into sharing private information.

You might want to report the text and block the number. If you're ever unsure about a message, reaching out directly to trusted sources or organizations can help verify its legitimacy.

Content: It‚Äôs not social media related, but I my neighbor brought this (Springfield) up at the apartment complex garbage can. Showed her the actual tweet and gave her the facts; she was not impressed (‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just a rumor!‚Äù) the presidential candidate spread that in a national debate. Gives me hope he may end up more hurt by this with undecideds than helped.

Content: Penzey's Spices is a great place to buy spices in bulk and they have trial sizes if trying something new.

Cooking is something I enjoy and I've been purchasing from them for years. Good quality. Fun recipes. Gift ideas for any holiday.

This is also a reminder to me to order their cocoa and cider packs now that the weather is starting to turn.

Content: My coffee or tea order.  Earl grey with cream and no sugar is Captain Picard's. I do like it. I sometimes order a Chai late in a cafe, however I usually go for either a mocha or a late. Usually a mocha, if I have not had their mocha yet. (I like to try to try coffee mochas at small indy coffeehouses, or order a Chai late there if I can't?) However, perhaps it is Latees , that is my most common  order.  ‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï

Content: Hi Eric!

I am sorry there are people in your comment sections being disingenuous and worse.

My suggestion is to resubmit and to take a screenshot of the comment. Be sure to include the date(s) and time(s). Same goes for your initial report.

Try resubmitting the report again with the screenshots.

After taking the screenshots and resubmitting, delete the comment to protect your peace.

While my personal preference is to keep such things/not to dirty delete, I understand that deleting and moving on is sometimes the better option in the long run.

Good Luck!

Content: **Strict Fundraising Rules (it‚Äôs the law):**
We can only fundraise on behalf of: Democratic National Committee, Harris Victory Fund or Harris for President directly. 
We can recruit for "non-official events" that are hosted by partner organizations or volunteers in ‚Å†non-official-events-only. We can recruit into anything that is listed on events.democrats.org or a state democratic party's mobilize.
Rule 3 Note > Relevance: Do not post links to petitions or other calls to action that haven‚Äôt been approved by Staff. This forum is not intended for debates. Additionally, do not attempt to raise funds or share fundraising links for any entity besides the Democratic National Committee. Using this server to raise funds for yourself, another candidate, or another organization violates campaign finance law and is strictly prohibited. Anyone who violates the rules is subject to removal or time out.

Content: Take screen shots. 

Keep submitting reports to FB. 

If it‚Äôs super threatening, call your local police. If you have the person‚Äôs phone number or address, they might call them and let them know they‚Äôve made (whatever the threat amounts to) and could be charged now, but they usually give a warning.  If you don‚Äôt know the person, the police will take a report, but won‚Äôt likely do anything about it.

Also, feel free to reach out to me privately for how to lock down your FB to only friends and family.

‚ÄúWe Can Stand Together‚Äù
By Bruce & Michelle Marshall ¬† ¬©2024
"When some turn a blind eye to justice, and bury their heads in the sand;
We could squander this opportunity don't let it slip through our hands.
Now I'm feeling a sea change upon us, I ask is it pre-ordained?
If we don't take action and face all the facts, we could be forever changed.
CHORUS
We can¬†stand together,¬†Give our future this¬†chance,.
Will we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you stand.
We can¬†stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.
Our Children will carry that mantle if given the chance.
Now some say it's part of a cycle, some say it's part of a scheme;
Some say it's fate now old mother nature is coming apart at the seams.
Now most of us want all the same things, a world without bias and strife.
The same opportunity once and for all is every American's right.
CHORUS
We can¬†stand together,¬†Give our future this¬†chance,.
Will we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you stand.
We can¬†stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.
Our children will carry that mantle if given the chance.
So go blame society,¬†go say your piece and cherish your deep held beliefs.
And all that had mattered got all torn and tattered, history always repeats.
When some turn a blind eye to justice and then quote scripture and verse;
When hypocrisy rules we call out the fools and we all take a turn for the worse.
We can¬†stand together,¬†Give our future this¬†chance;¬†
Would we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you stand?
We can¬†stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.
Our children will carry that mantle if given the chance.
We can¬†stand together¬†we can strengthen the ties.
We can't let this new found common ground get tossed by the wayside.
We can¬†stand for freedom. We can¬†stand for freedom."

Content: We need a meme of a young black woman with a cell phone advocating being part of a phone bank. I just spoke to her the other day in NC while on my phone bank. I have posted the one above on my social media pages but we need another version too. Thank you.

Content: Nope, the material in the Reach App is for you to share! ‚ò∫Ô∏è  We love fundraising and getting more volunteers, but Online Engagement is specifically focused on having conversations within each of our digital communities to inform and persuade voters. Have you had the chance to attend our Online Engagement Trainings?

Content: I have not - I signed up twice, but life got in the way - is there a recording of any of these trainings?
I asked the question because I created a meme and it was taken down because it wasn't promoting voting or fundraising.
If they thought it was lousy, I get it, but now I'm just confused.

Content: No worries, we have trainings multiple times a week so feel free to sign up for the next one that's convenient for you -- we have one tonight at 8pm ET if you're available! We also have sessions on Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday -- you can sign up and see all times here: https://events.democrats.org/event/615101/

For memes, we try to keep all of our content engaging, uplifting, and accurate. That may have been where the discrepancy was but I'm not quite sure. We also have a Meme Training you might enjoy here: https://events.democrats.org/event/684758/ !

Nope, you don't have to send the map to us -- you're welcome to share it here if you'd like to give others ideas of what their online engagement communities might be, but it's mostly for you to use as a map for the 2nd part of the training, so you can identify what communities to have what types of conversations with

Content: I posted a meme in FB that I got from Pantsuit Nation that has gotten some good conversation going. It's about how tariffs are paid by the American consumer. Someone refuted that, because technically, yes, they are not directly paid by the American consumer, but then several people pointed out how small, private businesses may have the option to not raise prices on foreign goods, publicly traded ones don't ever use that option. **70% of people believe tariffs are paid by the foreign companies/countries.** That means there are Democrats out there who believe this. Let's get out some information on tariffs for the people who think his orangeness has better economic policy than Kamala.

Content: Totally agree. It is a huge area where we can support her. He lies, she comes back with facts. She calls it the Trump tax. But I do think people need to understand tariffs. (Because I don't think he does and he keeps repeating it)

Content: Yep! A new poll from Reuters/Ipsos put numbers to this: "Some 56% of registered voters in the Sept. 11-12 poll said they were more likely to support a candidate backing a new 10% tariff, or tax, on all imports, as well as a 60% tariff on imports from China....The poll found one in three Democrats said they were more likely to vote for a candidate backing higher tariffs and steep levies on Chinese goods, compared with two-thirds who said they were less likely to do so. Independent voters mirrored the wider electorate." https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/16/donald-trump-tariffs-2024-election-poll/75246207007/

Content: <@225877156247502850> Maybe this team could brainstorm some less work-intensive, quick online content campaigns around the economy that we could scale outward...and maybe we could apply lo-fi "game" tactics like quiz questions etc. Keep it simple, you know? A few campaign-endorsed key points we wanna really hammer home, a few key myths to debunk. I'd be totally up for joining an ideation session on this, if the team leads here think the general idea makes sense/is appropriate.

Content: Oh, just to be clear I've switched the idea for now away from a game-game, to more of a "could we pull together and align around a small online engagement campaign around key economic points and assumptions, and make that content coordinated, fun, and interesting?" Could be memes, video clips, quiz questions...far simpler than my initial ambitious idea.

Content: From the Reuters/Ipsos article, I pulled out these economics issues we could work with: A) **Inflation**: whose plan will lower it best, and how; B) **Tariffs**: how they work, impact on prices and consumers; C) **Tax cuts**: who's offering which cuts (overtime, tips, corporate, etc.), and who benefits; D) **National debt**: whose plan addresses it best; E) **Overall business climate**: whose plan will best drive growth, innovation, support, and how

Content: With seven weeks till the election, we could focus on one of those five topics per week, sharing out memorable, interesting, engaging content, and leave two weeks for "wild card." Volunteers could pick their favorite topics of the group to focus on, too. Many ways to coordinate. What would be the next step here‚Äîstart with the campaign issues page, draft a list, then add some sub-points and "fun ideas to drive engagement" to each of the five topics? Please note I've done this kind of work before, and am 100% committed to producing messaging that aligns with the overall campaign and existing messaging.

Content: Yep, straight from her stump speeches and platform. I was thinking about how to message these numbers to make them "more real" to social media audiences. Like a post, asking people: "Kamala Harris wants to give Americans a $6K child tax credit...how would that benefit your family, or families you know?" People could respond, and from their answers we could collect some useful data/feedback for the campaign.

Content: This is a bit off-topic. I am designing banners to take to Trump rallies and post them outside. Simple messages such as 'Choose Country' or "Choose Democracy". I need to have a strong link to the Harris-Walz campaign on the banners. i.e. Pictures of Kamela Harris and Tim Walz. The pictures need to be high resolution (the banners will be big) and with transparent background. I am sure the campaign media / graphic design office has material like that. Can anyone here connect me?

Content: Thanks so much, Gabrielle. üôÇ I actually don't have any social media communities anymore besides LinkedIn, so whatever I add to the doc Alan created will be for him and others here to use if they want (I'll post on LI). And I'm abroad without a US phone number, so there's some friction for me in joining sessions. I have a few years of PR, comms, and comms engagement experience so I'll leverage that.

Content: During the debate, I posted this quote from Harris on Mastodon ‚Äì and it was by far the one that got the most engagement. (I only started my account in July and have about 20 followers, so getting over 30 boosts and 50 likes is a lot.)

Problem is, I didn't get her quote quite right (this is what I remembered in real time). The transcript is a lot wordier (https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542).

Can you point me to some similar quotes I could share? I want to emphasize this kind of unity message.

Content: It's mixed IMO. He says she "nailed it," but also undercuts that with comments about "the puppet master running the strings." He can't give her full credit for her accomplishments, can't bring himself to say that she, on her own, is a winner. But maybe this is the best we can ever hope for, from someone like him.

Content: Took a closer look and have drafted about a dozen social media messages focused on inflation stats and facts, including some that quote your blog post + link. Do you want to take a look? <@353287477601107988> could share the link to our G-Doc with you. As I think I noted in the news channel, we will also draft messaging on tax cuts, business climate, tariffs, and national debt. The idea is to have a ready-made place of copy-and-paste-able messaging folks can tweak and share. Would you be interested in helping with that?

Content: Thank you for sharing these. One technique I have been using is to paste good news like this to Facebook and not even mention Biden or Kamala. It gives the viewer a sense of the good economy without the sense of pushing any political message.

Content: Yes for sure. A lot of people don‚Äôt even get the chance to see positive news, especially those who watch Fox.  Hopefully it gets them to think ‚ÄúMaybe the economy isn‚Äôt that bad‚Äù on their own without being told by a political campaign. I hope it works.

Content: Trump's Health/science Record - Thanks much for the article links to Trump's record on reproductive health and healthcare generally. There are articles in professional journals I like to cite - they are rated as more objective/credible than media sources so that helps when posting community notes on twitter. Amazingly, two of the most prestigious journals are so scared about a possible Trump return that they have recently published editorials. Several journal articles in past few years give concrete evidence of Trump costing lives due to pandemic mismanagement - just one example here. Dr Francis Collins was just on msnbc saying number of lives lost needlessly was over 200,000 [clips available later]. His new book is 'The Road to Wisdom --- how to combat disinformation.'  https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2024.307737 https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vote-for-kamala-harris-to-support-science-health-and-the-environment/ https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32545-9/abstract

Content: Hey all: yesterday <@353287477601107988> and I worked in a G-Doc where we are drafting and storing social media messaging related to five nuts-and-bolts econ issues: A) inflation B) tariffs C) tax cuts D) national debt E) overall business climate. Currently DJT leads Harris on economic issues and we want to change that with clear, convincing messaging. We really have to spread the word that Harris is the strongest economic candidate‚Äîexperts say it's the issue that's keeping the election so close. Please go here and you'll find draft messaging on the first two topics, inflation and tariffs. More to come. And feel free to add your own! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bZO28R1O3qmz_TKXXzt7LC6WlomGrgqtykXcMbYTxvw/edit#heading=h.6n536cjpykdb cc <@1138245834157334599>

Content: Stepparents and Adoptive Parents for Harris - Can this be a thing? Or are there already any graphics with this theme? I just saw Sarah Huckabee Sanders' jab at Harris for not having biological children, which is just the latest comment like that from MAGA leaders. These infuriate me. My son is not biologically mine, but it is the honor of my life to raise him on behalf of my friend who died in childbirth. Women and men who step up to be parents deserve respect and support, not insults. There are so many people like me who have welcomed children into their hearts and are working every day to raise them to be the best people possible. I would love to make that part of my outreach.

Content: This great.  Will use it for sure.   What do you think about adding Immigration as an economic issue?   Or maybe add under Inflation?  Something like 40 to 50% of our agricultural workers are undocumented immigrants, and tRump wants to round them up and "send them back."   Food prices will go through the roof.

Content: In re: Energy & Fuel Prices

I have found this site useful in terms of accurate data and visuals:
https://www.eia.gov/

Public misunderstandings of the energy markets I have encountered in the wild include:
- Energy is a global market. Not all countries/continents have similar levels of resources and thus we trade.
- Who/what OPEC is and how that affects crude oil pricing
- Our refining capacity
- That our country operates at an energy deficit and while we have made strides toward energy independence, we still have room to explore and grow
- The transportation and supply demands during 2020-2021 and Trump's 2-year OPEC+ deal...
- Which in turn had disastrous effects on small-to-midsize energy companies here
- We continue to be the leading exporter of Liquid Nitrogen Gas (LNG); but fracking has negative impacts on the environment
- Under Biden/Harris, we have more leases and are pumping more crude, but we lack the capacity to refine it
- Once the pandemic was declared over, supply demands increased, but the OPEC+ deal continues to keep the global supply low

And Two pipelines: Keystone & Keystone XL
- Keystone XL was a project by TransCanada Corp/TC Energy started in 2008
- Keystone is still operating; Keystone XL was shelved in 2021 because it violated the Clean Water Act, didn't meet NEPA requirements, and crossed tribal lands (remember the protests?)
- Tar sands/tar sand oil is dirtier and more difficult to refine than crude

The ‚ÄòFoundation estimated that the Trump tariffs cost American households more than $625 annually‚Äô when he was President" -- article also says "the Trump GOP no longer has a political philosophy beyond what is in the former President‚Äôs head. The party‚Äôs economic platform is a contradictory mix of tax cutting and tariff raising" Gotta love the Wall St. Journal [sometimes :)]  https://on.wsj.com/4bViRV4

Content: I've added a bunch of social media messaging on inflation, tariffs, and "general business climate" to the economy doc‚Äîthanks to those of you who contributed!  I'll continue working tomorrow, "tax cuts" and "debt." If anyone's knowledgeable on those topics, would love the help. Again: We're doing this to debunk the myth, somehow still held by many independents and reasonable-GOP, that DJT is "Mr Business Man" who's better for the economy. We need Harris to soar ahead on this issue, it's key! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bZO28R1O3qmz_TKXXzt7LC6WlomGrgqtykXcMbYTxvw/edit

Content: I don't know of a Catholic national call -- there is a great group  Vote Common Good.  It "is inspiring, energizing, and mobilizing people of faith to make the common good their voting criteria. And, we train and support candidates to connect with Evangelical and Catholic voters" .  They have videos of national bus tour rallies and do postcards to Republicans of faith.     https://www.votecommongood.com/  Another effective group is Network Advocates for Catholic Social Justice with nuns on the bus      https://networkadvocates.org/

Content: I've asked twice to be on the content creation team. I've worked for 20 years creating content as a freelancer. I know how to do almost everything with Canva and have great proofreading skills (according to my son's college professor LOL) I'm not trying to brag here but I'm really interested in helping. I know everyone there is swamped and I have time to help with some of the load.

Content: I can work on this after I get the economic content in our G-Doc in a good state. Meantime, I would point out that hundreds of ex-GOP officials and staff (and counting) have backed Harris, including just yesterday 111 ex-GOP officials‚Äîdefense secretaries, national security leaders, etc.‚Äîwho call Trump "unfit to serve." Trump's "strategy" is to surrender to Putin and Xi. Harris noted in the debate that he's stated publicly he doesn't mind if Putin does "whatever the hell he wants" to NATO allies. Lastly, you might post this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6oQXN2WNtU

Content: Trump's tie with Putin is dangerous to America's safety. I would worry about America's safety more than WW3. 
Let Russia take Ukraine, let China take Taiwan. America will lose the status of World Leader forever. Who would dare to trust America, when America abandon its longtime ally. 
Trump is so weak to surrender to Putin. NATO is our shield against Russia's advance. Trump will not support NATO. A weak NATO will cause harm to America's safety.

Content: Hi Bre -- Very quickly you can fact check your question about CNN. Please do  that before posing such questions. Turns out that questions like that can often be the source of false rumors [Elon does that all  the time]. Please see discussion about cnn in twitter-community-notes this week. They do some great fact-checking, which I use a lot  on  twitter. take care, Dan

You‚Äôre never going to convince someone who is steadfast in their beliefs that her policies on it are good, but you can convince them that they‚Äôre not that bad and Trump‚Äôs would be worse

Content: Also as someone in that age demographic as well, I will tell you that usually its apathy 
Their idea is either ‚ÄúI live in a blue state, it‚Äôll be fine‚Äù or ‚ÄúI live in a red state and my vote won‚Äôt change that‚Äù
I usually just point out that if everyone did what they do we would be doomed lol

Content: On this point, using the state and congress levers might be an option. State govts have a lot of influence upward on the federal govt (look at where we are right now with secs of state, election process, etc.). And as skadreamer notes, the congress counts for a lot.

Content: This is a really good point, I've noticed this messaging resonating a lot with folks who are otherwise apathetic as well! It's all a part of the "A New Way Forward" -- we want the future to be equitable and just in every way so it's important to consider all of the things the position of President touches/impacts! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Content: <@1280619651029798924> I realized I had to change my response to Pluto because it was a bit off-point so I'll repeat my original comment here: I know friends who vote mainly because of the judiciary -- they don't want to see extremist, right-wing judges installed. To add to that: a lot of our rights are caught up and getting trashed in the courts. We all know about SCOTUS, but some of the circuits (especially 5th, TX/MS/LA) are being used by folks like "Leon" Musk to judge-shop and get their way.

Content: Just to wrap up my thoughts for <@708139387581497416> : state courts and govt bodies saved us a bunch of times in 2020 during the onslaught of BS lawsuits by DJT and his team to overturn the elections and the will of millions of voters nationwide. We need fair, ethical, rule-of-law judges, legislatures, and local officials every step of the way, or else our lives are going to be a LOT different. Hopefully that can get some of your friends to reconsider! üôÇ

Content: It would be nice to have there be viable third parties, that's not where we are and if the greens were serious about their policy, they would join the progressive sect of Democrats, and try to pass voter reform laws so that elections can be more competitive, but it seems as if they are more interested in self-martyrdom then actually trying to change the world that we live in

Content: On the Palestine issue, Kamala Harris has been in a tricky spot. She's the VP, not the P. And she's part of a team she didn't pick. But people act otherwise. Biden has been strongly pro-Israel for decades, regardless of the details (their govt, etc.). She cannot undermine him, especially now. I wish people were more understanding of this.

Content: The logic that people should realize is that Palestinians tend to support a two-state solution, Kamala supports the option that is most popular to Palestinians. Our choices, as far as Palestine goes, are two State solution, where Palestine gets their sovereignty but Israel also is allowed to continue to exist, or one state solution where Israel completely annexes Palestine because Donald Trump gives them the green light. People argue Non-Stop that a Harris presidency would be just as bad for Palestine as a trump presidency, those people do not understand what they are talking about at all.

Content: No, it won‚Äôt. The biggest indicators of a country‚Äôs fall into authoritarianism and/or how likely people are to be racist are income inequality and access to education (which is also scaled to income). Trump‚Äôs death won‚Äôt change either. 

Unless Democrats are willing to risk their big money campaign donations and get serious about it addressing income inequality and the suffering people are experiencing because of it, defeating Trump is nothing more than kicking the can down the road. There are plenty of potential new figureheads in the wings: DeSantis, Greene, Rogan.

Content: Income Inequality has been an issue since the 60s. However, this is about race period and until that real discussion is had than people are going to blame things that they can do something about since black women have the least access to capital but have the most education of any group in the US.

Content: I disagree, I think in terms of left-wing third parties in the US, the green party is not a good option because they are single-issue in nature. At this point in US Politics, third parties are basically just activist groups (with the exception of the Libertarians) and as activist groups go, CPUSA and DSA are way better than greens because they are anti-Russia and anticapitalist as well as being pro-environment. Of course, I say this as a socialist so I fully understand if liberals here disagree with that but I think that my perspective as a socialist is relevant in the discussion of left-wing third parties

Content: No. Income inequality is worse (https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/#:~:text=Income%20inequality%20in%20the%20U.S,greater%20than%20in%20peer%20countries). Access to college education does correlate to more liberal values, though whether that is because of exposure or because those who aren‚Äôt struggling themselves are going to be more sanguine about someone else getting a leg up is unclear. (https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/04/26/a-wider-ideological-gap-between-more-and-less-educated-adults/). And that leftists dismiss all of Trump‚Äôs rise or why working class, rural whites don‚Äôt think Democrats have their interests in mind anymore as ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just racists‚Äù plays right into the Republicans‚Äôs hands. I live in a currently Red state, and this ‚Äúbasket of d√©plorables‚Äù nonsense *turned us* from purple to red.

Content: Indeed, and it's possible to do that with cooperation and care on how words impact others.  It's clear many are passionate about addressing income inequality and systemic challenges.  This is just a reminder to ensure our work here is cooperative in nature so that we align with community goals.

Content: Hi everyone - question. What resources do we have about immigration - I‚Äôve heard a lot in my network from Latinos who immigrated 30+ years ago and are not happy that ‚Äúpeople are being given asylum, and getting housing/$‚Äù‚Ä¶.tagging it to President Biden specifically and indicating that the ‚Äúhard‚Äù stance on the republican side is attractive. Would love to engage with facts about what is actually happening

Content: You can also arrive at the same position with just basic logic, just pose the question: "why would an illegal immigrant commit crime, therefore putting themselves at high risk of deportation?" This demonstrates to people that there is very little motive for "illegals" to have high criminality

Content: Too many Americans think the economy was better under Trump than Biden-Harris, and we Democrats from top to bottom need to remind the American people of the following facts:  There was a net loss of 27 million jobs when Trump was president and Biden added 15.6 million jobs. Even if we exclude the pandemic, Biden still had a gain of 8.8 million jobs while Trump had just 6.7 million jobs.  GDP growth was 2.9% under Biden and 2.4% under Trump.  The average unemployment rate under Biden was 4.1% and under Trump it was 5%. Source:  Bureau of Labor Statistics - CNBC on June 29, 2024. Steve Rattner today, Sept. 19, on Morning Joe again pointed out that even if you exclude the pandemic, the economy was actually stronger under Biden-Harris.

Content: If Trump continues with the high tariff rates with imported goods, then even more prices are going to go up, especially gasoline. The "Trump sales tax" is going to cost average middle class families at least $6,000, meanwhile it'll give millionaire families a $300,000 tax cut

Content: my response (when trying to be brief) is "inflation and how much companies charge for goods aren't the same thing. inflation _in general_ has gone down, but how much companies are charging for things like rent or services is going up, while wages have stagnated. nothing is capping the prices that companies can charge for their goods. which is why despite the economy "getting better" and companies are making more money, we're still paying more."

it's an extremely crude explanation and not 100% accurate or detailed but it's enough for the average person to understand.

Content: Hi Claudia:

What I have discovered out here in these Social Media Streets is folks are misinformed about the difference between an asylum seeker, a refugee, migrant workers/day laborers, and folks whose visas have expired. Some of these people have documents, some don't, and some are in the process of completing their immigration.

Asylum is a legal process and I would encourage you to look up 8 USC 1158--and have that handy.
(Once someone sets foot on US soil, they can claim asylum. You don't have to go through a port of entry.)

The percentage of asylum seekers who are granted asylum in the U.S. varies depending on the specific time frame and the type of asylum case. Here are the key points:

- Overall Grant Rate: Historically, about 30-40% of asylum seekers who go through the U.S. immigration system are granted asylum. This includes both affirmative cases (where the seeker is not in removal proceedings) and defensive cases (where asylum is sought as a defense against deportation)
- Recent Trends: In recent years, the grant rate has fluctuated. For example, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, around 46% of asylum seekers were granted asylum. Defensive asylum cases, which make up a larger portion of total cases, typically see a slightly lower grant rate, closer to 39%.
- Comparison to Total Applications: While about 70% of asylum seekers may initially pass the "credible fear" screening, which allows them to stay in the U.S. while their case is processed, only about 20-30% ultimately qualify for asylum through the full legal process.

These numbers highlight the challenges faced by asylum seekers in navigating the U.S. immigration system, where a significant portion of applicants are ultimately not granted asylum despite being allowed to stay in the country temporarily during the process.

In some states/counties/cities, undocumented people are allowed to vote in those elections, which makes sense because they are living/working/paying taxes there and should have a say about what affects them day to day.

Content: In re: "Open Borders! Trump Closed It!"
1) We are and have been under 8 USC for 60 years and that included during Trump's term.

2) In 2020, Trump had the power under Title 42 to declare a public health emergency. Biden wanted to extend it in anticipation of the processing backlog, but SCOTUS ruled the request unconstitutional since the pandemic was over.

3) The comprehensive border bill authored by R-Langford was shot down in the house because Trump wanted to run on it. Harris wants that bill back on the floor and has stated she will sign it.

Content: There was a Zoom element, however, my guess is they also used YT because Zoom only let's so many people into one call.

Content: I would appreciate any Tumblr advice. Where I live I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable with a lot of my acquaintances knowing who I support. But I have a Tumblr called Madamepresidentkamala. I love the reach feature to automatically share important media. But I would appreciate any advice on what‚Äôs a good blog profile photo, if I should change the blog name, and the most effective election hashtags

Content: hi! i rarely use tumblr these days, but i still have familiarity. any icon will do but i'd personally pick one of Kamala smiling, or maybe any art that anyone might have made of her (like that lovely 'forward' poster). as far as url change, i'd remove the 'e' between madam and president, since it's not needed (but i'm being nitpicky)

other than that, as long as you have it somewhere clear on the profile that you're not actually affiliated with her campaign as an official staffer, i think all is good!

Content: not a problem! it's been a while since i did anything like that for tumblr. and it's understandable, i'm only recalling that when i saw the drone show they did before the debate they spelled it 'madam'. one of those things where English decided to make up its own rules

Content: reposting can get some negative attraction, yeah. but reblogging or tagging the original artist helps make up for it.

shadowbanning is so hard to figure out too. i have no idea how shadowbanning even works on tumblr. i'm more familiar with it on youtube, surprisingly?

Content: I looked at it and if people said something mean about it it's probably because they're one of those "not into politics" people. Maybe tell them that politics can affect your life directly so it's important to be able to cast your vote .

Content: Wow, I seldom get much other than a few likes on my fb political posts (it's just my family and friends and by now we all know where we stand), but I used the idea from here and posted this morning "What is the first presidential election about which you have even the faintest memory? What was the first presidential election you voted in?" and I am getting some dialogues going! Thanks for the ideas here! Election or not, it is nice to see something more than likes to my posts.

Content: The general advice is to block trolls and negative posters and not try to engage with them. You might encourage the person who posted the video to block trolls. Interacting with them boosts their numbers and invites more of them.

Content: Key Research Findings on Immigration & Crime - I will try to find a place to post a version with citations. I'll also summarize refutations to specific attacks on Kamala regarding immigration.
‚Ä¢    Many studies conducted over the past 150 years are quite consistent: Contrary to popular belief, both authorized and unauthorized immigrants have crime rates equal to or lower than those born in the U.S. 
‚Ä¢    Some studies focus on homicides. Immigrants, whether authorized or unauthorized, have lower homicide rates than people born in the U.S. 
‚Ä¢    In a study of all 50 states, increased unauthorized immigration over 14 years was not related to terrorist attacks, radicalization, or terrorism prosecutions. 
‚Ä¢    ‚ÄúSanctuary communities‚Äù are as safe as other communities. They are likely to decrease crime because immigrant victims are much more willing to call the police. 
‚Ä¢    Although there is no connection between crime and unauthorized immigration, the media almost always depicts immigrants as criminals. 
‚Ä¢    Despite calls to close ‚Äúopen borders,‚Äù the U.S. has not had open borders since the 1920s.  Reports indicate that the border is well fortified.
‚Ä¢    Policies during the Trump administration led to long-lasting trauma for children separated from their parents.  The Trump administration‚Äôs ‚Äúreturn to Mexico policy‚Äù forced asylum-seekers back to Mexico to await their hearings. That placed them in extreme danger. At least one in 70 people forced to return reported being victims of rape, kidnapping, assault, and other crimes in Mexico.
‚Ä¢    Policy-makers can help prevent homicides by immigrants by supporting social service and law enforcement practices that welcome immigrants. These homicides will not be prevented through deportations, further criminalizing immigrants or banning sanctuary communities. Research studies do nothing to comfort the loved ones of those brutally murdered, but they can be used to create policies that will help keep everyone safe.

Content: Texas has removed a million people from their rolls. Oklahoma has removed hundreds of thousands. We really need a messaging campaign that tells people to check their registration status NOW & a link to a site that will guide them to fix any problems. This is a serious issue that I think we can address and I know we must.

Content: The margins are too thin in too many states. We can't afford to have our voters showing up to vote only to find they've been removed from their state's rolls and they can't fix it. Only political junkies like us know this is happening.

Content: Just wanted to drop in here to share - I did 2 Online Engagement Trainings today and we have so many new volunteers joining who are so excited to be here and help contribute to the campaign!!

Watching the polls can be an anxiety-inducing and nail-biting experience, especially when we know the race is so close. But the truth is, what will determine the race isn't the polls but the people. And I'm so thankful to have the literal **thousands** of volunteers we have, each and every one of you, dedicated to getting out there and engaging your communities online, to make THE difference in this election. 

You all are doing an amazing job of welcoming, informing, and persuading voters to the campaign, and I appreciate the stellar example you all are setting for our newest incoming volunteers! We can and will win this thing, so keep fighting!!

Thank you guys for bringing the joy and doing the work. And remember -- when we fight, we win!! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> üåä

Content: !!Need Help!!  I am engaged with some youthful voters in my network and am trying to inform them on THEIR thoughts that ‚Äúthe economy was better under Trump.‚Äù

I‚Äôve done my own research and have several articles and links to share.  I‚Äôve also reviewed and used the Google Docs that have been shared.  The amount of reading they would have to do got me thinking maybe there was a TikTok/Instagram reel that may cover this topic.

1. Does anyone know of or can vouch for the creator of this reel zak.kimball given he isn‚Äôt main stream media?
2. I‚Äôve found the information in his reel to be mostly, if not very accurate and am wondering what others with more experience, think?

Content: Hi Ray!

If it is any consolation, I am hearing similar arguments from adults and I suspect younger voters/interested youth may be repeating what they hear at home.

On the one hand: We had the pandemic which caused global inflation and supply/consumer goods shortages, and had many schools and parents/guardians learning and working remotely.

On the other hand: Biden & Harris worked with congress to pass the American Rescue Plan (which put a little more money into our pockets), the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS and sciences act (which is bringing manufacturing back and creating more jobs). Of the G7, our economic recovery was the fastest.

From here, ask each other questions and encourage their media literacy learning (which may coincide with How to Cite Your Sources lessons in school).

Good Luck!

Content: Your best rule of thumb is to either find a free source with the same info or if you have a subscription, you can do a "Gift" link which means that whomever has that link will be able to view it without the worry of a paywall. Just a tip from someone who has done this for years. Also one of my friends in Hawaii does the "Gift" link a lot when he wants to share articles that he has access to but others might not.

Content: <@1265829155669545094> it's less implied solicitation than frustrating for ppl who can't access. The gift link is ideal, but I have also seen ppl excerpt part of the article and/ or screen shot

Content: It's no problem. Remember, there's always a work around. Gift links, finding the info elsewhere, screenshots...even copying the text and citing the source works.

Blast from the past! I love that the algorithm placed this gem in front of me <:kamalaharris:1269013846564012083> I wonder how many people from that crowd have stuck around and are among the Harris-Walz staff and volunteers <:bluewave3:1270555729836900453> I also love that Sen. Romney has since regarded Kamala as an ‚Äúintelligent, capable person‚Äù <:blobLoudSpeaker:1278209125448290428> <:100:1252803350026653726>

Content: Can someone help with this? I've watched many, many speeches and don't recall Kamala saying this.  It's an incredibly awkward phrase, so it would stand out. Am I missing it or is this untrue?

The quote is "what can be unburdened by what has been" - I don't mean to give the video more unnecessary views. I notice they don't include any video of her saying this.  If she had been repeating it, that would have been easy enough.

The claim is that this is Marxist code phrasing for the intention of wiping out (destroying)  everything that has come before in order to build a new society.

Do we do anything to combat this or do we ignore the misinformation?

Content: Only one problem with the screenshot thing: Unless you use alt text (ie a description of what the photo says), it will prevent some from seeing it as they have vision issues and some devices those visually impared people use don't always show photos/graphics that well. This is why a lot of people when posting graphics will either post a descriptive text with them or will inculde a short summary that will help the VI person with getting an idea of what is being shown. Learned that from a college friend who is legally blind.

Content: I've also watched nearly all of her speeches and do not recall her ever saying anything like that, either. Not even close. Weinstein is part of the Thiel/Musk/etc. axis of VC-vil. Those guys and their candidates have already shown that they're willing to make up stuff out of thin air.

Content: Hi Ray - re Economy TikTok -- Seems comprehensive and good charts. I don't repost anything that uses the F word. Seems very long -- I bet there are better ones. Also citing stats on the good economy won't reach people unless they first hear empathy about the pain they feel. Kamala does this well e,g, NC speech on the economy where she first acknowledges  gas and grocerry prices are to high and then pivots to how she'll fix that with concrete plans

Content: 100%. <@1082643965167288360> , one strategy I've seen suggested by others many times in these cases is to ask questions seeking to understand *why* they think the way they do. And from there you can unearth contradictions, gaps, assumptions. I've tried it myself with good results.

Content: üßäToday‚Äôs Icebreaker üßä
What was the first presidential election you voted in? (No shame if this is your first!)

I'm kind of embarrassed about this because I might show my age. 1996...Bill Clinton's re-election. And yes, I voted for him and no, I don't regret it. Now that I think about it, I voted Democrat in every single election I ever voted in.

Content: I've tried Canva which works pretty well. Also, if your computer has a video editor already installed (like iMovie or Clipchamp), don't underestimate them. I used iMovie to edit video for YouTube for years. I'm actually wanting to learn how to use Clipchamp since I bought a PC recently but I think I need to upgrade the laptop slightly since I don't have that big of a hard drive and the memory isn't that much.

Content: I had a friend in high school who always had something like this at her house. Theirs was cucumbers with tomatoes and a vinegarette and the crazy part is the only one in the house that really ate it was her dad and when I was over there, he always split it with me because he knew I liked it.

Also one of my favorite go-tos was always this pasta dish my sister used to make where she took any kind of pasta and combined it with olive oil, a little garlic and Italian herbs, and a lot of cheese. I still make it from time to time since it reminds me so much of my sister (she passed away four years ago).

Content: The more Trump speaks, more revelations appear about his true motivation. Many of his comments come straight from Project 2025: Charging tariffs without Congress, vote for him this time and you won‚Äôt have to vote again, lying about the legal Haitians in Springfield, freeing the January 6 insurrectionists. The playbook is already ‚Äúin play.‚Äù

Content: Yeah I couldn't vote for another Clinton. Not after NAFTA (offshored manufacturing jobs) and the repeal of the Glass Steagall act (directly caused the 2008 economic crash). I'm old enough to remember Gore losing the debate on Larry King to Perot about NAFTA. Perot was like a visitor from the future.

Content: Question: Anyone else with an Android having this weird thing where Reach is just sending them back to the start of the app after sharing the content? I shared something on X/Twitter and went to switch back to Reach (using the three lines that show you what apps you have open) and it took me back to the start of the app! It's annoying becuase I wanted to record that I shared that piece of content.

Content: I mostly voted for her because I knew for years Trump was trouble. My dad worked a job years ago that had ties to him and also I have a friend from college who lives in Atlantic City so I heard all the stories on how he did AC dirty. Sadly, no one listened to me because I still remember arguing so much with my brothers about it. They both stopped speaking to me this year, by the way.

Content: I think it‚Äôs important to mention that 45 has violated the Logan Act by making negotiations with Netanyahu to NOT end the war! (He wants toe war to be a wedge issue.) Unfortunately, the Logan Act (unauthorized private citizens negotiating with a foreign government) has never been enforced.
So if they have issues with Biden‚Äôs policies, then they should absolutely have issues with 45.

Content: Here are my thoughts and I could be dead wrong. Harris is part of an administration right now and doesn't set foreign policy. I personally believe her approach will be different than Biden's. Her words have been nuanced and she has said she supports Israel's right to defend itself. I think she is holding back for the sake of continuity and because it's her role as VP. I know this doesn't really help but, she's a woman of color, she's a moderate progressive.

Content: I also think it's critically important we elect a democratic Senate and House. Harris could be The Perfect Candidate, but -- despite djt's delusions! -- the president is not a dictator. She's got to have support from Congress to make the changes we all hope for happen.

Content: To be honest, Joel, people don't think about this and sadly that has a lot to do with gender. I agree with you on all of this and from what I'm reading and seeing, people are starting to realize exactly what you have observed. Now all we have to do is get them out to the polls to vote for her.

Content: It's not embarrassing. My dad voted for the first time in his 50s (he's 78 now). I was more the "I first voted at 18 type" because I came to age in the 90s and to me, that was a defining decade in a way.

Content: From south Jersey.  He had a reputation for bankrupting small businesses by getting them to bid no margin, asking for tons of additional work for free, then refusing to pay them, even when the work was done to contract.  He was reported to use the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bury you in legal‚Äù threats that so many big companies use. But everyone thought it might be their big break and he was so rich they didn‚Äôt believe the rumors. Suckered so many small businesses.

Content: I turned 18 in 1985. I don't think I voted in 88. In either 1992 or 1996 I protest voted for Ross Perot because I did not like Tipper Gore, Al Gore's wife. I just knew that Tipper. meddled in music and I did not like her parenting me. Also, I didn't have a television and information wasn't as easy to come by as it is now. I finally started paying more attention and voted for Kerry in 2004 and then Obama in 2008 and 2012. Voting became extremely important in 2016 when I voted for Clinton. Even moreso in 2020 when I voted for Biden. I guess I had a rough start but I feel like this is the most important election of my life.

That's why more and more Republicans are endorsing Harris.
Trump, a convicted felon, is running the GOP presidential campaign. Enough is enough. Those Republicans with clean conscience no longer support Trump. 
Cheer up. For God's sake, the Trump soap opera will end in 45 days.
Trump - Expiration Date : 2024, Hallelujah.
Harris - Madam President : 2024, Hallelujah.

Content: <@&1245831457818279986> Has anyone seen anything similar to this document but for overall general policies?  I am looking for positive highlights of both the Biden/Harris policies and for the proposed policies for the Harris/Walz campaign which I suspect I can find some of at https://kamalaharris.com/issues/. Also looking for any contrast to Trumps bad policies. Thanks

Content: Good morning from TEXAS üíôüåäüíô. I am signed up for Volunteer Texting, yet there seems to be enough volunteers for this effort and not enough work. I've taken on a personal/professional (social worker for those with disabilities) task of emailing swing state educators (Wisconsin finished, and I'm now in North Carolina) with an attached copy of Chapter 11 from Project 2025. I include bullet points that will dismantle public education and eliminate the Dept of Education. To this end, does anyone have any recommendations in terms of volunteering more with the campaign? I prefer to avoid phone banking, yet if that's what is needed, then I'll volunteer my time. We've ONLY got 6 weeks to go, and we/I can't let up because the stakes are too high! Thanks so much for enduring this long message! LOVE you all for what you're doing to save our country!!! üíô

Content: Hi <@1285227754480078853>. I double check. I think that's pretty much it. If you can share it on your other social media platforms, that will be great. Otherwise, thank you so much for creating this animation! I really like it. Looks super official!

Content: üßä  I got involved because I was already combatting mis/disinformation online and because another sent me the link to order a hard copy of P2025 once it became available and encouraged me to read it.

I have been aware of christian nationalist movements since coming out in the 1990s and watched these take root in the Central Valley, especially among fundamentalist and evangelical sects. I have watched it spread from the pews and pulpits to BBS/usenet, from BBS/usenet and torrents to social media, from social media into streaming channels. Among and from these, I watched how these organized into non-profits/charismatic churches to avoid taxes and fund the chipping away at the protections enshrined in our constitution.

As one childless and queer cat lady who was raised by a rocket scientist in Silicon Valley (yes, That Guy gets it wrong all the time), I can't do much. However, I can share what I know and work together with the people who see the danger and want to Do Something. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Content: Hello, I attended the Reach App Training, and I have a follow-up question. When I note that a friend is a strong Harris or Trump supporter, does that friend know I did that? Also, if I select "share with the democrats" next to their contact information, does my friend find out I shared their info? Thank you!

Content: I'm pretty sure NJ will stay blue since I know Andy Kim has a huge cult following...at least in South Jersey. I also know a few people who have worked on his campaign and they have told me how well received he is there.  PA has a good chance since Bob Casey is still pretty well liked but sometimes when I see those signs for McCormick, I get nervous.

Content: <@&1266883962727432304> I wanted to ask what the server rules are regarding file sharing? I wanted to share a pdf that breakdowns the risks of project 2025. It also includes a section (that I found particularly interesting) where it outlines historical parallels. I didn‚Äôt create it though, I was able to download it for free from David Pakman‚Äôs website. I was considering just sharing the url where you enter your email address and you‚Äôre sent a copy of the document, except there‚Äôs a ‚Äúsubscription - become a member‚Äù button that is in clear view at the top of his webpage. So that‚Äôs a no-go per fundraising laws, right? I‚Äôm still unsure on how that works‚Ä¶ but if I just post the pdf document on here, would that be ok?

Content: PS <@682653283252437001> - Regarding the donate button on David Pakman's site, we got clarification that news-related and activism non-profit sites are okay to share, even with a donate banner.  Still no candidate sites or political action committees though.  We get those quite a bit. üôÇ

Content: That is true, but since we allow news sites all the time, as long as the content is solid, I would include Substack as news, even though it is user-created.  Many writers are journalists and academics.

Content: üßä I remember "Real World" on MTV and used to watch "Survivor" when it first started. Me, being on any Reality TV would be a disaster and/or unintentionally funny with my gaffes and bucket of awkward!

Content: Kamala‚Äôs Digital Captains - Nevada

The Harris/Walz Campaign and Nevada Democrats seek out-of-state volunteers to make phone calls and post content online to help keep Nevada Blue. Democrats won Nevada in 2016 and 2020 by less than 3 percent. This is an opportunity to significantly contribute to electing Kamala Harris as the President of the United States.

Content: I would love some advice on how to find possibly undecided voters or potentially persuadable Trumpy voters on Threads and X. My algorithms are feeding me all blue voters for the most part. X is filled with so many trolls in the comments of any posts from right-wing news accounts that it's hard to know where to bother engaging. Do we have any data on the value of engaging on X at all?

That said, I've had some good conversations with a couple of blue voters who were posting cynical takes. I point out the need for encouraging engagement through positivity and a spirit of unity. I've also been wearing down a couple of intelligent evangelical friends on FB who don't like Trump but have been lied to about Kamala. It's amazing how effective one can be when acknowledging people's concerns rather than judging and arguing!

Sincerely pro-life people are worried about the "unintended consequences" of the harsher abortion restrictions, and it's easy to change people's minds about economics if they're not completely absorbed into the cult.

Content: I was able to share vital information pertaining to Project 2025 with my R girlfriend who was receptive. She was able to see how various states are implementing different aspects of this already. Frightening to say the least! I'm involved with an active grassroots group here in my hometown & we meet tomorrow to write more post cards! Plus our entire state is encouraging all colleges/universities to register all students who are eligible to vote & we're a part of that with our local university! Exciting times! Vote BLUE!! üíôüíô

Content: Yes, I've been through both parts. They didn't go into much detail about how to target engagement if most of your relationships and group affiliations are already pretty liberal. I feel like I'm good at these conversations and just need to get better at zeroing in on best opportunities.

Content: What I've been focused on is following the people linked to the Democrat Rolodex X account - and I just quote-tweet and use the #YesWeKam tag. At this point I think it's less about engaging with conservatives and more about amplifying the message of Democrats.

Content: A lot of the graphics are a lot to be desired but the creators are limited with the colors that we can use. I wish that they would upload meme content on Reach. I make memes the campaign which has to go through an officia review process which are separate than ones that I  make for the meme channel but the are in the supporter content channel but not in Reach.

Content: I tried to venture out. Posted on YouTube. Troll üßå galore. But I was able to reach a voter from Wisconsin. We followed each other on YouTube. She just sent me a message stating that she had just casted her absentee ballot for Harris-Walz. I guess dealing with the trolls is worth it. One voter at a time.

Content: I've been posting economics and jobs stuff on LinkedIn, ramping it up quite a bit this week to inform people who follow me (around 6K). My style is to keep posts factual, usually just sharing a quote from the article/report/video stating the core issue or takeaway fact. Engagement isn't high‚Äîone or two likes at most. If I shared some dull personal administrivia, I'd get 200 Likes within 2-3 days.  Oh well. I will keep doing this, as maybe someone will see a post that registers and they will be inspired to take action (change vote or vote at all, or share info with someone else).

Content: Some people here might find this interesting. I mod for a small meme subreddit and i started tracking how many clicks the links in our sub get so i can better gauge the effectiveness of our automod messages and stuff like that. For just the US IP addresses we have about 200 clicks for the last 2 weeks for links on how to register, vote reminders, volunteering for the Harris campaign and donating to various efforts as well as donating to a food bank in Springfield Ohio. Obviously not all of those clicks equal a a new voter, volunteer or a donation but i am sure some do.

Content: Kamala‚Äôs Digital Captain - Nevada

The Harris/Walz Campaign and Nevada Democrats seek out-of-state volunteers to make phone calls and post content online to help keep Nevada Blue. Democrats won Nevada in 2016 and 2020 by less than 3 percent. This is an opportunity to significantly contribute to electing Kamala Harris as the President of the United States.

Content: I don't see why not, I think that's a great idea! I would definitely focus on highlighting the contrast between the two administrations. Here's some COVID content we have in Reach (though there's not a ton): https://app.reach.vote/library/search?campaign=democrats and a fact sheet from the White House on the most recent measures taken to ensure public health: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/09/fact-sheet-actions-taken-by-the-biden-harris-administration-to-ensure-continued-covid-19-protections-and-surge-preparedness-after-public-health-emergency-transition/

Content: I wanted to share this with you all since I think a few of you may have requested a community note on X/Twitter regarding this. There was a post going around saying that Harris used a teleprompter during the Oprah interview. I put a comment saying, "Teleprompters are often used in video production and they're usually to keep things running smooth for the host in situations where guests are 'ad-libbing' their answers." Seems today I found this in my notifications and the Trump supporters once again showed they were lying. PS. I only went that techinal becuase I have a degree in Communication & Journalism but I took a lot of classes in video/TV production and digtal media. Of course it wasn't anything like it is today when I was at Rider, that's for sure.

Content: it's good to remind people to check their voter registration! it's true there's been added legislation to try and prevent 'fraudulent' votes which are actually doing no good for anyone. luckily, they're either being challenged (Georgia's already has been) or were rejected (Paxton's attempt in Texas failed) 

always remember to check your voters registration!

We need landing pages to help these groups organize. I‚Äôll think about whether there is something I can do. I‚Äôm already doing a bunch of media campaigns and TikTok work. I‚Äôm going to friend you <@814685350529597450> so I can find you again

Content: Thank you. I've been canvassing with a state representative and GCC is in her district and also on TikTok. I haven't been able to find a group at either if the Az GCC campuses but know several students here. I'm trying to find more to help them register to vote. I've already helped  a few students register and my kids are working on helping acquaintances at NAU register.

Content: Hi <@642970771081396224> I encourage you share about Voteriders and explain their mission. But we have to remove the link because it has a donate button which isn't going to HVF.

Content: Kamala‚Äôs Digital Captain - Nevada

The Harris/Walz Campaign and Nevada Democrats seek out-of-state volunteers to make phone calls and post content online to help keep Nevada Blue. Democrats won Nevada in 2016 and 2020 by less than 3 percent. This is an opportunity to significantly contribute to electing Kamala Harris as the President of the United States.

Content: If you have not already done so, I recommend checking your voting status via https://iwillvote.com. Not only can you check your voting status, but you can also register to vote and check the status of your ballot since the website is hosted by the Democratic National Committee (DNC). 

You can also use https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote to figure out how and where to go vote from your state or local election authority.

Content: Sometimes the simple content is what gets the most engagement. We asked one of our neighbors if he could hook us up with some Harris Walz yard signs. He brought enough for all who asked. And he put them in our yards yesterday afternoon. When I got home from work I took a picture after I walked my dog. Posted the picture with a little commentary and the likes have been coming in all day. Up to 2,100+ right now. 
What makes this significant is a lot of women in ‚Äúred areas‚Äù of Michigan are stating their concerns on putting up yard signs in their red areas. Some have put them up just to have them stolen or defaced. Others have found other creative decorations. The idea of posting is to encourage not having fear of your convictions. Detroit is a blue area. So if we have to do the primary Harris Walz shout out, we will. When WE fight, WE WIN!!!

My advice is to contact their campaign directly. Good luck, and thank you for everything that you're doing to support Democrats!

Content: I recently posted in a few Hydrocephalus support groups about being worried about the ACA being overturned, and I asked if anyone else was worried about that. Most people either were worried, or were from other countries and appalled by our healthcare system. I also recently made a video talking about my experience with Hydrocephalus, and one of the things I talked about was the Affordable Care Act. In the video, I‚Äôm crocheting a wall hanging that tells the story of my Hydrocephalus journey. Feel free to share it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YOT8wHfP9I

Content: For replying to news & social media about Kamala in AZ today...

HOW BIDEN & HARRIS HAVE FOUGHT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

CALIFORNIA. As California AG, Kamala Harris went after drug gangs, human traffickers and cartels that smuggled guns, drugs, and human beings across the US-Mexico border.

CENTRAL AMERICA ROOT CUASES. In 2021, VP Harris led the effort to address root causes of illegal immigration to the US from Central America, negotiating $4B in direct assistance and over $5.2B in US private-public investment. With economic recovery 2022-23, encounters at the Southern border from all countries increased, but the share of encounters from Mexico & Central America decreased by 30% points.

BIPARTISAN BILL KILLED BY TRUMP. In Feb 2024, Trump urged Republicans to REJECT the bipartisan immigration bill that included permanent restrictions on asylum while significantly increasing border agents, asylum adjudicators and immigration judges. The bipartisan bill (supported by ~20 Rep Senators) was DEMANDED and NEGOTIATED by Republicans who tied the bill to a Ukraine aid package, but Trump killed the deal for his own political gain.

BIDEN-HARRIS ASYLUM RESTRICTIONS. Between Feb and Jun 2024, the Biden-Harris administration developed and executed a plan for DHS and DOJ to suspend the entry of most migrants crossing the US-Mexico border illegally, virtually shutting down asylum processing. The Biden-Harris plan differs from Trump‚Äôs plan by providing exemptions for humanitarian reasons such as victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.The result was ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS FELL TO A 4-YEAR LOW. More recently, Biden has secured additional funding for the most significant increase in border agents in ten years. 

COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. As President, Harris will bring back the bipartisan bill and sign it into law. And she will push for  comprehensive reform that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship.

Content: I need some advice to help my 74-year-old housemate. Her friend from the 1970s seems to be only aware of information from Fox News. They haven't seen each other since the 1990s. My housemate thinks her friend is intelligent, and they both used to work for the NSA. It's difficult for my housemate to have open conversations with her friend. Do you have any advice for dealing with this kind of situation? She is worried her friend is a Trumper and is trying to talk to her. She seems upset her friend has changed. I think being of service has some to do with it, too.

Content: Asking questions is a good first step. Asking to suss out positions, flaws in logic, and also to build trust. Because it puts the asker in the position of listener, and this is important for making people feel safe. The trick is to not react right away or judge, but to listen and stay calm. Someone else in here recently posted this, which gives another angle: https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/9/23/2272160/-Well-It-Took-Years-I-Didn-t-Try-and-It-Worked-Anyways-I-Deconverted-My-Friend-s-MAGA-Son.

Content: Not certain this is the right place to ask. Do we know if ,LA is planning to do anything on Oct 7 --- e.g., calling for a cease-fire? There are going to be memorials for both Israelis and Palestinians in every major city. I can supply a link from If Not Now if that would be helpful to anyone.  Thanks.

Content: Thanks for bringing this up! I would post in the <#1268426751164551199> channel. Sharing the link from If Not Now could be helpful for others who are interested. You might also want to check with the LA organizing channels to see if they have anything planned for Oct 7. 

While there‚Äôs no official campaign policy published yet on the conflict in Palestine and Israel, Vice President Harris has stated at rallies that she supports protecting both Israel and Palestine and supports a two-state solution. She has called for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. The issue is complex, as policy on Israel involves international law, treaties, and Congressional approval.

Content: What we can do on our end is:
- Request a Community Note (CN) on the post since it is on Twitter
- Rate & uplift the associated CN, once it gets approved

It looks like the congressman found that figure in the table on page 3.

What we can't do:
- Infringe upon the congressman's (and that of others) free speech
- Take any action which might be construed as harassment or bullying

I am confident the campaign and/or party was made aware of the claim prior to it's airing and is discussing how to respond.

Content: GOP Leaders Say Trump Killed Border Bill -- yes, there are several leading Republicans who say Trump killed the bill -- here are two more clips and I have more - Mitch McConnell: We spent months working on a bipartisan bill to secure the border, but Trump didn't seem to want us to do anything at all. He told us to kill the bill.      Fox Host: It was your colleagues in the Republican Party who torpedoed your border bill, not Democrats GOP Sen. Lankford (R-OK): It was. Trump said don't fix anything, so my colleagues looked for a reason to shoot against it. (June 2024). Would good if a content creator could put brief clips of each in one video https://x.com/i/status/1828452199942217979v https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1819065900529545685

Content: Immigration & Crime. I have focused on this topic & will look in the claims about migrant murderers.  Here is one of my summaries on this topic [I have links to references]: Many studies conducted over the past 150 years are quite consistent: Contrary to popular belief, both authorized and unauthorized immigrants have crime rates equal to or lower than those born in the U.S. These findings hold true for immigrants from Mexico. Some studies focus on homicides. Immigrants, whether authorized or unauthorized, have lower homicide rates than people born in the U.S. In a study of two border cities, homicides decreased as immigration increased (Martinez et al., 2015; Nowrasteh, 2024a; Orrick et al., 2021. In a study of all 50 states, increased unauthorized immigration over 14 years was not related to terrorist attacks, radicalization, or terrorism prosecutions (Light & Thomas, 2021).

Content: IMMIGRATION - A BIG topic now - Kamala speaking now at border& so we see MAGA push back. Here are some more myths and facts -- feel free to use in community notes and replies. **Sanctuary Communities & Abolish Ice. **Harris has not imported gang members. ‚ÄòSanctuary communities‚Äô are safe & do not shield immigrants from deportation. Harris does not grant immunity & has never wanted to abolish ICE. She did not want to make border crossings legal, but rather a civil infraction, https://bit.ly/4f2kFyl https://bit.ly/4f7NjOs https://bit.ly/46vpX1q https://to.pbs.org/3ADuxi6
**Open Borders. **Despite calls to close ‚Äúopen borders,‚Äù the U.S. has not had open borders since the 1920s.  Reports indicate that the border is well fortified  https://bit.ly/3XTgAG5 https://bit.ly/3XWrfPd
**Non-citizen Voting**. Right & left-leaning foundations find non-citizen voting is EXTREMELY rare. The Heritage Foundation found under 100 cases among 1 billion ballots over 20 years. Those who might vote risk everything ‚Äì deportation & possible jail time. https://cnn.it/3LMzuHC

Content: **Harris‚Äô Role in Migration Reduction from Central America**: Contrary to reports that Kamala Harris was in charge of border enforcement, a ‚ÄúBorder Czar‚Äù, she was assigned to work with 3 Central American countries, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, to reduce the underlying causes of migration to the U.S.  She built on her experience as a DA and Attorney General in California, where she worked closely with CA police & prosecutors & their Mexican counterparts to bring drug smugglers & human traffickers to justice.
Migrants make the tough choice to leave their homes & homeland to make the arduous & dangerous journey to the U.S. in order to escape extreme poverty, gang violence & corruption. 
She helped send more $4 billion in U.S. aid to those countries, including COVID vaccines. She obtained the involvement of over 50 companies that have invested $5.2 billion & created more than 70,000 jobs. Columbia Sportswear, Nespresso, auto-parts manufacturer Yazaki North America Inc., & others created thousands of factory & farming jobs.
Her efforts were stymied by entrenched gang violence & corruption. Nonetheless, migration from the 3 countries during the Biden-Harris administration has fallen 35 percent, to a level lower than it was in 2019 under Trump. While encouraging, it‚Äôs hard to know if her work on these long-term solutions helped produce this decline. https://wapo.st/3ABKjtI https://ampr.gs/3WNFHIt https://bit.ly/46SZmeA

**Kamala Harris learned a lesson about the border early in her career. It‚Äôs paying off now** - As California attorney general, Harris found common cause with law enforcement in cracking down on transnational gangs - Blake Jones, 08/17/2024 https://politi.co/4fM4TIb  As CA Attorney General, Harris expanded a task force devoted to cross-border criminality & fostered greater intelligence sharing with Mexican authorities, which officials said yielded arrests years later. During her elections, she obtained endorsements from Republican district attorneys and from law enforcement. She worked cases on human trafficking, sexual abuse & other violent crimes worsened by transnational gangs.

Content: Are we sending any volunteers to engage on Reddit?  It seems like a largely untapped social media platform for us, and it's a goldmine.  It's largely already liberal, so we can focus on getting out the vote, recruiting volunteers, and getting donations.  Even better, it's easy to target people.  For example, in the Georgia subreddit we can reach out to people in Georgia and make sure they know the deadline for registering to vote is coming up.  I've already had some success getting hundreds of likes and comments on some posts, some in subreddits that are probably low engagement voters or non-voters.  Since most people are not going to like or comment, that means many times more are viewing these.

Most of the comments on Reddit today are liberal but not helpful.  We should be providing actionable information, especially in local subreddits.  Links to information about voting, registration, etc.  We should jump in when anyone makes a complaint about Trump and provide information for people to do something about it!  I'm already doing this as much as I can, but the more people we get involved, especially in local subreddits (every city has one), the better.  I can't cover all the small subreddits.

Content: I loved when she did the interview with Oprah because of the way she responded to that bombshell that she's a gun owner. As someone who is a Democrat and can legally carry in PA, I love when you see someone on our side say about that because it chips away at that stereotype that all we want to do is take away all guns when we just want sensible laws like we had in the 90s under Clinton.

Content: Favorite moment of the campaign so far? I have watched many political conventions, way before I was deemed old enough to vote... Her acceptance speech of the nomination <:YES:1252806140081737780>  However, I did enjoy watching her perform well at the debate, as she finally had an opportunity to explain policy to those of us who aren't involved in the campaigns or watch 24/7 cable news.  VP Harris exposed that Trump had no replacement, if the Republican party repealed well, you know.

Content: I have been posting the Reach content a lot! I notice I am getting more followers and engagement, but finally today, I got both a quote tweet, and a comment. Both positive . Thank you to whomever it is who diligently gets so much content in the Reach app and very timely! By the election, I might be having a relatively interactive social media experience instead of just sending things into the void. I dp have some loyal followers who retweet my tweets fairly regularly, so I like that since it gets the Harris/Walz reach content out in front of ever more viewers. Anyway, just kudos to the reach content creators!

Content: I shared this on LinkedIn last night and got four likes (out of 7K followers ü´§), which is maybe the most engagement on election posts I've gotten at LinkedIn. This morning I'm posting a similar graphic from Reach to see how it goes.

Content: I am a 70 something senior and don‚Äôt use twitter except for the campaign. When I try to post links like this on Facebook, my only social media, it just posts a link that says x.com, no image or verbiage. Am I missing a step?

Content: Hi there. So, I posted one thing from the Campaign and suddenly my Facebook account was permanently disabled. I run (ran?) a Facebook group (Postcards for America - through which we launched Postcards to Voters) of about 10K. 8 years of work gone. I mentioned this in General Conversation and they suggested I post in here.

Content: My whole personal profile was booted. (And that I‚Äôve had since FB began‚Ä¶) I wonder if the pages I created are gone? (Postcards for America & Democratic Candidates 2024) are still there?
At least the info I‚Äôve put in the group will be there for folks to see for now.
That was sweet of you to check that, thanks.

Content: My only suggestion here is to reach out to Meta and ask them to be specific with regard to what they need to get your account(s) across the platform reinstated anyway.

I also suspect that while you may have been removed from the groups, those that you have created and which meet a membership threshold will still be there.

If worse comes to worse and Meta won't restore access (even after asking nicely), you may need to create a new set of accounts and ask group members/friends to approve your rejoining.

Content: Hi. I‚Äôm sharing a TikTok about the Trump campaign using bots and his engagement stats (1.5%) vs Madame #47 Harris campaign stats (8-13%) on TikTok. https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8R4muDg/ comments/likes/hearts on the Harris TikToks and accounts posting in support of our candidate are valuable and important. If this post is removed I‚Äôll repaste with just the info sans TikTok. Thx.

Content: I used these all together on FB posts to my neighborhood association. Please note that Absentee ballots have just been mailed out in Michigan. So any content to 1) Encourage getting your ballot returned early, 2) Encourage women in red areas that they can vote in secret without husbands/boyfriends knowing how they voted, 3) Encourage folks in red areas that other national GOP now support Harris-Walz like Jeff Flake. 4) Content to encourage folks in red areas to have confidence to show ‚Äúblue support‚Äù via pearls/chucks; blue polish manicures; post-its in women‚Äôs restrooms; Harris-Walz yard signs. The more messaging we can give Michigan women in red areas to help them show others they are not alone, the better the vote will be. Michigan women in red areas who support Harris-Walz are some of the most courageous people around right now. They need support as our front line warriors. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ

Content: I don't think it matters what Trump says anymore,  I think the people who are voting Harris  will and KNOW He's Dangerous and the Trump voters are already ready to vote for him. I think  the best we could do is make sure the undecided voters know as much about Harris  as possible.  People  need  to understand  her stance on  foreign affairs , the middle east is a hot bed for fear of 3rd WW, the economy ( she's done that) but needs to message  more in interviews,  and immigration policy  talk about  it more. I don't think  we should keep  advertising  for Trump. We don't  need people  thinking he's a Tough guy, foe some reason the US is in love with them. I think Harris  should talk about  Relief and sustainable  living for the victims of all States devastated by Helene.

Content: This video of Gov. Walz was very well received. Especially since I used hashtags of a current football game for best targeting. The Detroit Lions will be on MNF tomorrow evening, so any male targeted video content from VP Harris or Gov. Walz which is light hearted and fun would be great. https://x.com/swattsbulb/status/1838327217908257179?s=46&t=k_nRE4Mh7eR4nJj9bOXdPw

Content: I made a TikTok with 9 of the most recent Tim Walz info memes in reach I‚Äôve had over 620 views and a lot of interaction. For me these are huge results! I haven‚Äôt yet addressed comments abt the way he handled Covid because I just haven‚Äôt been quite sure how to respond. Otherwise, it‚Äôs been great!

Content: I might be able to if you‚Äôre able to post it! I‚Äôm kind of limited to Tumblr because I live in one of the reddest states in the country and I‚Äôm involved in a very red field. So my Instagram and Facebook base leans Trump. I was terrified just to post a temporary ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Harris story‚Äù

Content: I think highlighting his madness does help motivate those Trump -> Biden voters that are now on fence because of cost of living but were repeled by Trump in his first term that‚Äôs why they went for Biden. The NYT and Wapo does a good job of identifying these voters in their coverage - sometimes they even offer their full names and jobs hehe. But ye these type of voters are key

Content: On LinkedIn, I've started sharing the @kamalahq posts showing JD Vance ranting about childless women who pursue careers and "punishing" childless people. There are two such posts since the weekend. You might do same, to reach more apathetic women or undecideds. Coincidentally, Russia is considering legislation to ban "childfree ideology." JD Vance belongs in the Kremlin, not the White House.

Content: ALSO: I've been posting in the <#1288163431911788586> channel about opportunities I've spotted for posting campaign content. I don't have a Reddit account and think people with more karma would seem more credible there. Also it helps if an actual teacher posts in /teachers or an actual IBEW member posts in /ibew (for examples).

He's calling her that because ppl can tell HE, HIMSELF, has some kind of cognitive decline occurring, along with his horrible personality & damgeous ideas. HE & GOP PROJECT EVERYTHING THEY ARE & ARE DOING so sick! he made fun of a reporter with disabilities too.

Content: Our country is under attack from within. We must all sound the alarm. How can we get this video of the want-to-be dictator and his allies out to Kamala supporters.  The video shows clearly the danger and why we must elect Harris/Walz: https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0xS9HJ4WLwQwf95hY7nok5F4D5gtY57QivKNfz6UiTxUjrp5qbc4HwM7qJju3SbGEl&id=61563578667705

Content: Hey - Don't know if this will help, but you could consider sharing to the TikTok channel we have at No Access...Also, consider heading to "Dictator on Day 1" content on Reach - sharing a graphic might help with getting more traction over a long-form TikTok video: https://app.reach.vote/library/search?campaign=democrats

Content: Eliminating the national weather service would also pose a huge hazard to aviation. That‚Äôs where pilots get all of our information as to weather a flight is safe or if we need to file an alternate, go IFR, reroute etc. but I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to phrase it and I‚Äôm worried about what other pilots will say who have been brainwashed by MAGA.

Content: Kamala‚Äôs Digital Captain - Nevada

The Harris/Walz Campaign and Nevada Democrats seek volunteers to make phone calls and post content online to help keep Nevada Blue. Democrats won Nevada in 2016 and 2020 by less than 3 percent. This is an opportunity to significantly contribute to electing Kamala Harris as the President of the United States.

Content: My favorite thing about Tim Walz is his ability not only to connect with everyday people but also his compassion to help them and lift them up. One of my favorite memes says:  If you are having a rough day Walz will lift you on his shoulders so you can see a brighter tomorrow.

Content: <@1092866848862773380>  I also got into reach 5 minutes too late and the link disappeared. I really wish that wouldn't happen with live events, cutting them off at the time they start when you need to be a few minutes late or you get slightly sidetracked.

Content: If I post the same content , like an article to over 9 groups, FB blocks me and restricts for 24 hours. So if there is content i think groups should see I post to maybe 9 groups, take a break, respond to comments, get back on it. 

FB does not seem to limit photo comments. So if you can get your content saved as a photo you can go to town. üòÄ

Content: Well, if the Republicans have been spying, maybe it's time to step up our game with that 'intelligence ring'! üòÇ In all seriousness, it's crazy how much strategy goes on behind the scenes. We need to stay sharp and keep working on our ground/volunteer game, but we‚Äôve got this! üí™

Content: Infiltration isn't a great idea at this stage of the game if you don't already have sock puppets embedded their mod teams will sniff you out. And they all communicate with each other so if your account gets burned (for instance if they check mutual servers and see your main is here) then you'll lose access to all the servers you've gotten verified patriot status to that point will be for nothing.

Content: Kamala‚Äôs Digital Captain - Nevada

The Harris/Walz Campaign and Nevada Democrats seek volunteers to make phone calls and post content online to help keep Nevada Blue. Democrats won Nevada in 2016 and 2020 by less than 3 percent. This is an opportunity to significantly contribute to electing Kamala Harris as the President of the United States.

Content: You know what's wild? 

How quickly folks who subscribe to this kind/level of rhetoric go from "affable" to belligerent after asking some basic questions. Those I generally dismiss because they're usually harmless; all bark, little bite when they swagger up to The Box on live pods to blast the audience with their rhetoric.

I have come across two (maybe three) since becoming more civically/politically engaged that I flagged and/or reported to the company/platform where I encountered them. It's the cold. It's the lack of emotion. It's the disregard of the social contract. There is no bar too low or bridge too far in service to whatever goal they want to achieve. They are both chaos agent and are media savvy/know how to play an audience.

I've gotten better identifying one from the other. I've been doing this online thing since 1989.

I know some of what is out there and I make the choice to be optimistic and supportive when I can. TBH: I don't always get it right and I think I'm better just holding space when folks need it.

Bah. I'm up late because the weather. üòõ

Content: What struck me in particular was the prevalence of neurodivergence in the alt right. Lends itself to online chat rooms without social anxiety and the high IQs lead to superiority complex which when we collectively ignore the needs of the american people in favor of lower taxes leads to a sense of unfairness.  And so we see how small govt gop morphed into maga into maga communism. They're begging for populism to redistribute wealth to the middle class.

Content: The wild bit of this I found interesting is that Trump would like to serve as head of state and let JD act as PM making policy decisions which the big guy doesn't actually ideologically care about. He might really have a hard time understanding the perspective of the youths is why he makes such frequent gaffs and seemingly can't decide how he feels about things until he takes the pulse online or through polls then decides what to do

Content: Got blocked this morning by a guy on LinkedIn who's not American but apparently knows more about our political system than I (somebody who studied that system and lived under it for several decades) do. He seems to have a large following and wrote a post that contained numerous inaccuracies about our political system, the Dems, etc. He apparently values his opinions more than facts. Oh well!

Content: Hey, you never know. This person puts themselves out as an expert on a particular topic and does have a related business, but yeah! My hunch is that they're just one of these "burn it all down" contrarians from the left side of the spectrum, who likes to feel like a rebel.

Content: I have consistently maintained that an individual's character is their most vital attribute. Character serves as a reflection of one's true nature and inner essence. When we support individuals who demonstrably contravene the principles and values embodied by character, it necessitates introspection and self-reflection. Character-driven individuals exhibit compassion, honesty, fairness, self-discipline, sound judgment, respect for others, courage in upholding convictions, a strong sense of responsibility, civic-mindedness, and self-awareness.

Content: Absolutely look into it with FB; push through the FB support options until you get what you think is a clear answer (when you know why and are happy with your next steps). There are too many reasons why this and related account/content issues cause problems. Their filters and AI-powered evaluations can't not make assumptions. There is nuance. I just had the "pleasure" of reactivating a half dozen or so accounts and apps for my next steps in here. FB banned me from posting b/c I hadn't posted in a long.  X sent me through a labyrinth of validations for pretty much the same reason. Persevere and Google!

Content: I have a question about Tik Tok and Left Creators. We are having MAJOR problems and have no way to fix it and our factual information of the campaign is being taken down, we are getting CGV‚Äôs and we are being Mass Reported. 
I mod for a live and we got mass reported and taken down 2x today in 2 hrs for going over the new Jack Smith paperwork. I have to be honest we are getting exhausted of fighting with this. Any suggestions?

Content: Not sure if anyone saw Dean destroying Nick Fuentes on a debate. I saw it with Parker streaming it through YouTube. It was INSANE. Nick said he‚Äôd kill a baby if God said so. He also said he‚Äôd choose Hitler over his own wife to be president. Dude got destroyed even though it was on a conservative platform.

Content: I swear, Nick just got us more conservative women and lgbtq people riled up to vote against Trump. It was awesome. All Dean did was ask questions and the dude went crazier that killing dogs, cats, goose, or pets. It just didn‚Äôt get more attention than a presidential debate since Nick Fuentes is barely a nobody.

Content: That's a lot to clean up. Going forward, you're welcome to use my rule: 1. If it's not a message the company/entity has posted somewhere in your secured account, where only you  can see it, it's not real. Delete. 2. If you're not sure, sign into the account normally and look for a message the company/entity has posted to your secured account. 3 If you're still not sure, get advice from company/entity support.

Content: I got a message on Tik Tok that the video I posted (from reach) wasn't high enough quality to post. FB is very busy taking down Dem posts, but they are busy taking down posts for ridiculous reasons. My only suggestion is to make a little space between posting sessions. They like to pretend we are "spamming" ...

Content: Short Answer: Yes

Longer Answer: Progressive Social Media Influencers and Content Creators have experienced an increase in time outs and account bans this election season; these are increasing as we approach Early Voting and Election Day proper.

What we can do is keep going. By this I mean, keep on doing what we are doing; posting content from Reach, focusing our (re)posts in coordination with HQ, requesting CNs to correct mis/disinformation, and working within our spheres of influence to spread the message--and the hope and joy.

I expect the increase in account reporting to continue, so be prepared and do what you can to protect your peace.

Content: We have a lot of different strategies to make sure we're reaching as many voters as possible! So idk what this person is talking about, but I wouldn't consider them a reliable source. If you're interested in getting involved in more on the ground work, https://go.kamalaharris.com will show you canvassing and other events closest to you! <:happysun1:1270566006590541896>  

Online our best strategy is to have authentic conversations with people in our digital communities, as well as friends and family members. One thing this post got right is that you have a greater impact to energy expended ratio talking to those who are already on the fence/undecided and making sure everyone has a plan to vote, than trying to convince hardcore Trump supporters. At the end of the day though, we know every single vote counts and that's why it's crucial that we all do what we can to fight and win this <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>  

I wouldn't recommend intentionally going into MAGA-heavy spaces to try to convince voters, because you're not going to get as much "bang for your buck" there. It's also harder to keep up the momentum of joy in those spaces, and we know that's a big part of why this campaign is resonating with so many -- because it focuses on joy and the future! If you're interested intentional posting and commenting on socials,  I'd reccomend reacting with the emoji to join our Reddit community here: https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1260651617867399188/1260728814540165162 !

All of that to say, I super appreciate the creativity everyone is bringing to the table to try to make sure we reach as many voters as possible in the next 33 days!! We got this!! üåä   You might also want to check out our GOTV Bootcamp this Saturday, which has a ton of guidance and best practices to maximize our presence online: https://events.democrats.org/event/703304/

Trump took advantage of Helena to attack Biden. His statements were wrong. Trump's act is very unethical.

Content: I'm doing work in campaign social. I've decided to post on Twitter (won't call it the other name) and have gone into "magaland" and posted memes that show the difference between VP Kamala's plans and "project 2025". The reason I'm writing this is to let you know the resistance is STRONG on twitter and the magas aren't getting a lot of reposting. I take it as a good sign.

Content: A reminder that we have a dedicated <#1288163431911788586> channel for us to post content, leave comments, and upvote quality H/W content. Right now popular threads like /politics are bombarded with Trump stuff‚Äîeven if people there are pro-Harris, we still see a deficit of content about her+Walz and the campaign. Head on over to the channel‚Äîwe have materials, refreshed daily, to help you get started.

Content: I'm sorry that I couldn't share this in time for the VP debate because Pete missed something. The psychologists missed it too. Yes, JD has sociopathic traits; yes, he wants power, but that's not the whole story. He has a reason. I've met someone like him before.

JD has always been a systemic thinker. That's why he had a problem with Trump in the first place. There is a popular idea in higher education ethics that promotes calculated risks and meaningful sacrifices. This is the same thinking that drives doctors not to treat miscarrying women - because *they can save more lives by not getting arrested.* 

I think JD behaves in an inhuman way **by choice**, to serve a specific goal. I think he removes his own basic human compassion for the US population as a "necessary evil," in his head, at least. He believes he is the good guy protagonist on a crusade against evil, and I think Trump was only ever a pawn to him.

I heard him say in an interview (I wish I could remember where) that he thinks the world will become more compassionate if more people have children. I think he meant it. This is his own internal narrative, and he wants others to have the same profound experience because he believes people ONLY learn true compassion when they have kids. I think his plan is to put himself in power and force as many births as possible through legislation. I think he genuinely believes that this will promote peace and security for the future of all mankind.

Is he wrong? OF COURSE HE IS. People learn compassion in early childhood, not in the moment they reproduce. That's why its so easy for him to ignore the needs of a nation to serve his good-guy-protagonist agenda. His mother couldn't give him the compassion he needed when he was young.

This is his *reason* for wanting power, his psychological Achilles' heel. The more he is confronted with the reality of childless compassion, the more it will destabilize him.

Content: I agree with one small difference. It not his personal idea. He's representing the online communities trump has tried to piggy back off of. That's why he was chosen as the true ideological heir apparent when it was biden harris they thought it wouldn't matter that much to choose the sincere successor.

Content: They have Peter Thiel types in their DMs cheering them on thinking this is hilarious. They do believe it. They aren't immune to social shame. It's just that their social circle finds it funny and will only ridicule them for giving the normie response. If he were to give a PC answer he'd get trolled

Content: I went to the /kamalaharrismemes subreddit and there are almost no Kamala Harris memes. It's mostly anti-Trump stuff. Would someone want to share Reach content there? I can't, my new account is too new.

Content: I'm no champion of the fossil fuel industry, but I know what we have to do to win the election so am passing along this post -- the OP suggests more campaign messaging around cheap gas prices. Maybe folks here want to message that or even make a meme? https://www.reddit.com/r/Kamala/comments/1fx5vbv/gas_is_cheap_kh_should_advertise_it/. Found these info resources: https://gasprices.aaa.com/, https://www.gasbuddy.com/gaspricemap, https://x.com/gasbuddyguy

Content: Hi Carine, I congratulate you for talking to so many people the election. Reach has away to add them to the app depending on whether they need to register or are already registered. https://www.reach.vote/knowledge-base/adding-people/ if you can tell me more about what the form for inquiries is I might be able to help you find that too.

Content: Hi. I know we're trying to keep things positive here, but I just saw Trump say "The only way we're going to win is if we cheat." at 1:25 pm PT live during his rally in Wisconsin... Could that be something for online engagement?

Content: Kamala‚Äôs Digital Captain - Nevada

The Harris/Walz Campaign and Nevada Democrats seek volunteers to make phone calls and post content online to help keep Nevada Blue. Democrats won Nevada in 2016 and 2020 by less than 3 percent. This is an opportunity to significantly contribute to electing Kamala Harris as the President of the United States.

Content: <@1289310586794020889>. As democrats, we know how to tune out that nonsense.  As democrats, we have control now.  And as democrats, we know how to keep that control and seek to get total control of the senate and house as well.  The blue wave is coming.  We need more liberal like policies going forward to complete our mission. Kamala can and will  deliver on that!  Vote blue!

Content: Hello, all... Anyone have a "Rapid Response" message for this?
Not sure where to post this, so let me know if this isn't the place. Just saw several tweets about this story and wonder if we have a "rapid-response" from the campaign when this kind of thing comes up. It's gathering steam on twitter... https://tucson.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/elections/arizona-presidential-election-2024-kamala-harris-campaign-text-univrsity-students-public-records-gop-senator-criticisms/article_c748d336-84de-11ef-8131-7b69de378d61.html

Content: Hi, I do not have the rapid response message, but the GOP is playing its dirty trick. The presidents of the three universities do not admit any wrongdoing, and there is no criminal investigation. In addition, the mobile phone numbers of college students are available from the student clubs and organizations. If the student club leaders were Democrats supporters, they might submit the mobile phone numbers of their club members to the local Democrats office.

Content: Good Catch, Cece!

In re: Rapid Response
We do have a channel managed by the campaign and party and when they want us to take immediate action and/or help them capture a moment, they will push any instructions to us via the <#1250551973053468672>  channel.

From reading the article, it looks like the campaign is aware of the issue and it seems that certain information about students is a matter of public record in that state.

Content: I learned the hard way after starting a fb post via Reach, adjusting the text, lost the draft when I switched to safari to get a link to include. When I went back to Reach my post I had started was gone üòê I had worked hard on it too re inflation vs price- gouging . üò© next time I‚Äôll draft the text in Notes and paste it in my Reach post. Too tired to do it all over now !

Content: I don't live there anymore, but my mom lives in Lucy McBath's district, but she has been campaigning for Shawn Harris, just like she did for Marcus Flowers. She doesn't live in her district, but it's too close for comfort! LOL

Content: She seems to be genuinely ignorant not in a bad way but like she's just not really been exposed to certain counter viewpoints. Recently pretty impressed with her going to the holocaust museum and calling out Laura Loomers nonsense. There might be some goodness in her yet

Content: I think it‚Äôs just a lack of exposure myself too. She‚Äôs just very impressionable and that‚Äôs not a bad thing. She‚Äôs grown up in a very republican area and was raised that way. It‚Äôs not her fault and she can change if she wants

Content: Let's not get complacient though. I'm dead serious here, people! DON'T GET COMPLACIENT! We made that mistake in 2016 when the polls got this good and that's how we got into this mess! So with that said, keep the course and keep working to make these poll results translate into actual votes!

Content: TRUMP COMMUNICATED WITH PUTIN AFTER LEAVING OFFICE

- In 2016, Trump's campaign manager shared swing state polling data with Russian intelligence operative Kilimnik.
- In Helsinki in 2018, Trump publicly sided with Putin instead of US Intelligence experts.
- When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Trump described Putin as "very savvy" and a "genius".
- Since leaving office, Trump sought to undermine US foreign policy toward Russia with at least seven secret communications with Putin while urging Congress to block military aid to Ukraine.
- How can any American patriot vote for Russian agent Donald J. Trump?????

Content: I love this ad from Jon Cooper's X account, but why can't I find it on the Kamala Harris YouTube page? I want to use the ad in my social media, but I don't want to share it as an X link because it removes the graphics when I post the X link (no cover graphics for the video) on my Facebook page. Do you know if there is a YouTube link to this video?

Content: I know the campaign wants to maintain a positive tone, but Trump is now saying things that exactly parallel Adolph Hitler's speeches (for example, claiming that immigrants have "bad genes" that cause them to be murderers). This really shouldn't be ignored, in my opinion. Here is a post from Steve Schmidt that provides historical context and explains the implications for the rise of facism in this country: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQHerczlnA

Content: I have a story to share to help us improve online messaging when reaching out to undecided voters. While wandering around the city looking for Democrats stuff, I bumped onto someone. When I asked them for directions for the Democrats, they told me they are voting for Trump. I asked why and they told me their reasons: 1. Trump will be more effective at dealing with bad faith actors on the global stage like Iran. 2. Kamala Harris' economic policies will turn the US into Communist China and the people that will suffer the most will be the middle-class. I think hearing such things even if we have strong feelings about them is  important. Because it shows that there are other reasons people will vote for the other side or simply one reason. So, the thing to ponder here is how can we persuade people regarding points 1. and 2. as to why Harris is the better option. üôÇ

Content: This is what I do on TikTok--I wait a few minutes before posting again (posting what I created to other sites in the meantime). I also made sure I blocked anyone who said crappy things about Kamala. If they are just reporting you without saying anything there's not a lot you can do. I've also found TikTok doesn't seem to like certain videos--for quality purposes. So I use pictures and make videos from that.

Content: Right. But there is without a doubt that China is linked to communism aka very bad, and some people out there clearly believe Harris is a Marxist like a Red Scare 2.0 moment or someone even said she could be a Castro 2.0. Misinformation is part of the issue, and facts/figures helps for sure. But it is a talking point I have noticed on online forums.

Content: Hey Jorge!

I have been seeing similar on TikTok/on the Lives of progressive TikTok content creators for several weeks at this point.

The Good News: This can be redirected fairly quickly by asking the person to define Communism/Marxism, followed by asking them if they own their own home/property. A step further is to ask them what type of economy we have (spoiler: a mixed one.)

The Meh News: The person responding may have a negative reaction when responding so do what you can to protect your peace.

Content: Another talking point I have noticed a lot aside from the Middle-East stuff is the border situation and people saying Harris handled the border terribly. Personally, I feel the border is more under the control of the Department of Homeland Security. But how to respond to people who say Harris handled the border badly and that she won't do much in the next 4 years?

Content: Some key points, if I may?
- "Border Czar" is not an official title of any government official; it is one coined by MSM
- DHS is in charge of the border. It's chief is Mayorkas
- The duties of a VP are defined in Articles 1 & 2 of our Constitution; President of the Senate, a tie breaking vote there, and someone to take over for the President and/or extra duties as assigned
- We have been under Title 8 (8 USC) for 60 years
- Asylum is a legal process and covered under 8 USC 1158 (spoiler: no port of entry required)
- During C19 and under the public health emergency, we were under Title 42 which restricted immigration. Once the emergency was declared over, we went back to Title 8
- Harris brokered a deal with the Northern Triangle Countries to further economic growth in that region and to stem the tide of immigration (root causes strategy)

We run a live 5 days a week (apx 4 hrs a day) and the misinformation, hate, misogyny, vile humans that are there is insane‚Ä¶ There is a group of them that go around mass reporting Left creators. We get community guideline violations for putting out correct information, or show articles. We get DM‚Äôs of death threats, doxxed, our families get threatened, we even have Veterans information that was put out on TT publicly. We report it to TT and they don‚Äôt give a crap. We have people that have blue verified check marks with MILLIONS of followers & they are  spreading misinformation and we get nothing

Content: Ah, I'm much smaller than you are on TikTok--I haven't experienced that--yet. I've been lucky on twitter as well. Only a few but then they block me. Elon Musk liked a post of mine when I said something about them being insane--(before I started with DNC) and then I messaged him and told him I meant that for the maga crowd....He's certainly suppressed my account, but not banned me. I have reported hateful comments and Tiktok removed them. I'm sorry you are getting hate mail--it's really unnerving!

Content: JD Vance was correct when he compared Trump to Hitler - During an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Donald Trump said immigrants were filling the country with ‚Äúbad genes‚Äù and used lies about decades-old crime statistics to make his point.

Trump has long been obsessed with the idea that immigrants are ‚Äúpoisoning the blood‚Äù of America ‚Äî echoing Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler‚Äôs rhetoric. For years, he has lied that other countries are purposefully sending criminals to the United States.  https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-immigrants-bad-genes_n_67040a34e4b0924ce9db0b0e

Content: Five Days
Did I mention it took five days for the President to mobilize the military? Just follow along with the highlighted portions below. Remember, the hurricane was October 27th.
Roughly 500 soldiers with the 20th Engineer Brigade, XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division left Fort Liberty on Oct. 3 for Asheville, the largest city in western North Carolina and part of Buncombe County, one of the most damaged parts of the country by Helene. They are conducting inspections of the roads in the region, as well as clearing debris and transporting supplies. Several aircraft were deployed with them for the mission. 
More than 500 soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division deployed to western North Carolina on Saturday, Oct. 5. They brought at least 60 Infantry Squad Vehicles, and more than 15 helicopters to the area as well, for troop transport and to move supplies. The soldiers with Task Force Falcon will be focused on a variety of roles, including search and rescue, traffic control and clearing roads of debris. The active-duty troops will also prioritize the last step of getting aid to communities, transporting it from staging areas to ‚Äúthe point of need,‚Äù according to the Department of Defense. 
Helene made landfall on Sept. 26 as a Category 4 hurricane and in the days that followed tore through the southeast, flooding communities, forcing large evacuations ‚Äî including some at military bases along the path of the storm ‚Äî and leaving a trail of destruction. 
September 26 ‚Äî Helene Makes Landfall
September 27 ‚Äî Devastation in North Carolina
September 28 ‚Äî 
September 29 ‚Äî 
September 30 ‚Äî
October 1 ‚Äî
October 2 ‚Äî President Biden mobilizes the military
October 3 ‚Äî Mobilization of 500 soldiers begins
October 4 ‚Äî
October 5 ‚Äî Mobilization of 500 more soldiers for search and rescue.
Those blank days are days when people were dying.
And the media tells us everything is fine.

Do we have anything to respond to this

Content: Hey I just saw that folks weren't able to join our Countering Misinfo Training last night. It seems like the folks that were leading that training had some technical difficulties with the zoom webinar. These trainings should be good going forward and we hope you'll sign up for a future session and can join us!

Content: A message from a FL Dem via online engagement (note the last lines):  I live in Gulfport, FL. My husband and I evacuated to the nearest shelter after our flight out was canceled. TPA announced  their closing on Monday. They closed at 9:00 am on Tuesday and our flight was booked for 8:55 am. By the time we learned that our flight was canceled, everything else was booked so we were stranded. No rental cars are available as many cars had been damaged by Helene and rentals were taken. The evacuation shelter is grossly overcrowded, inefficiently staffed and dirty. If we survive the storm, we will probably get sick. 
A note: please advise the campaigns to stop asking for donations now. It's a very serious situation here and we don't want to waste our very limited phone power on them.

Content: I know we need to keep things positive, but there has been some negative feedback in response to Kamala's recent interviews on "The View" and the Stephen Colbert show. Here is an example from Steven Schmidt (who is on our side): https://open.substack.com/pub/steveschmidt/p/theres-not-a-thing-that-comes-to?r=gc81z&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email

Content: This is just personal and, of course, I will follow the guidelines of the team, but I thought it was brave and possibly true. She and Joe had/have a real relationship. You could see at the convention how they felt. Loyalty can sometimes be misplaced, but in this case I admire her for that answer. She went on to say how she might do things differently as President. The three and a half years of their administration has produced some amazing accomplishments. Are there issues the other side will try and use to beat her? Yep. But it's our response that will affect our supporters.

Content: Thank you for flagging this! I think the best way to respond to this is to continue sharing her proposed policies and the stark contrast between how a Harris-Walz presidency will benefit the people vs. how a Trump-Vance presidency would be disastrous for every single community except the top 5%. The goal is to not let our online communities get distracted by a few comments on an interview and bring attention back to the real policies that will impact our lives.

Your information is incomplete. DOD also deployed more than 6,700 guardsmen in just two days of Helena.

Content: FYI- Oct 27 -Trump plans a rally at Madison Square Garden... 
See Michael Beschloss account today on why this is important-
https://x.com/BeschlossDC/status/1555980937267134465

I encourage <@&1266883962727432304> / Content Creator Team to connect the dots to Trump's "very fine people" who will undoubtedly attend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxxxlutsKuI

In 1939, 20,000 Americans rallied in New York's Madison Square Garden to celebrate the rise of Nazism -- an event largely forgotten from U.S. history. A NIGHT AT THE GARDEN, made entirely from archival footage filmed that night, transports audiences to this chilling gathering and shines a light on the power of demagoguery and anti-Semitism in the United States. 

Directed by Marshall Curry

For more about the rally: http://www.anightatthegarden.com

Maddow's recent work /podcasts highlight the this period and group.

Content: Hi Donna!

Thank you for the heads up about the rally on Oct. 27 and it appears other news outlets are reporting on it also.

I think this post and its associated media would be better placed in the <#1268690577960992878> channel.

Otherwise, how does this content uplift the policies and messages of the campaign? Does this content help support both the campaign and its volunteers?

Content: This is not an uplift of current policies - Its a warning of what's to come IF....
The demise of democracy. Those who have succumbed to Trump's 2025 plan  have been slowly boiled like frogs to not be aware of what the outcome will really be. 
Remember -It was Charlottesville that moved Biden to get into the race with Harris.  Those "fine people" in the march continue to be on the march today lead by Trump and his minions - Ramaswamy. Their costumes have changed but not their beliefs.

Content: <@1276367808778862624> It is safe to say that those of us who are volunteering are doing so because we are aware of the history, have gone through that checklist, and are heeding the warning.

We *are* doing something. I also think it is safe to say the campaign, party, and current administration is also aware of and heeding the warning.

I realize that it is rough for many on multiple fronts and thus, it can seem/be overwhelming. That may be by design. But I know that it is often the little things/gestures which shine brightest during tougher times.

What small thing can you do to channel that discomfort and worry into action?

I truly do not care about Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden. I would spend the time to watch Broadway rally for Kamala Harris.

Content: Messaging Harris democratic policies of equality, better define  how Harris embraces pro-worker plank populism  - as opposed to Trump's fascist cons and checking with Putin and friends.  

Remind that it was Charlottesville that led to Biden becoming President with Harris as VP
"We are in the battle for the soul of this nation,‚Äù   ‚ÄúIf we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation ‚Äî who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.‚Äù Prior to her taking on the mantle of President, while campaigning with Biden: "The character of our country is on the ballot this year and I‚Äôm honored to serve by Joe Biden's side as we fight to rebuild our country back better."

October 27... in a blue state - Trump and  MAGAts will repeat what "very fine people"  they all are  (channeling Feb 20, 1939.)
Will this be provocation just days prior to election... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Remind all we must honor and sustain the soul of our country and not let billionaire supported white supremacist rantings overshadow what can be done for all....especially as Trump threatens all immigrants, legal and illegal.

Although Trump's rally got a lot of empty seats, the damages of his rally speeches were still going on. He accused that Harris forced Biden to drop out of election. He accused that Harris would cause 1929 depression. These accusations would cause widespread rumors about Kamala Harris. 
When the support of black voters for Harris is lower than Biden in 2020 election, those black voters loyal to Biden may turn to Trump, if they believe the false claims of Trump's rally speech.
Therefore, please do not underestimate and ignore the damages of Trump's rally speeches.

Content: I‚Äôd like to encourage people to listen to the ‚ÄúCall Her Daddy‚Äù interview with the future Madam President Harris. 

‚ÄúCall Her Daddy‚Äù has ranked as Spotify‚Äôs second-biggest podcast, only behind Joe Rogan‚Äôs ‚ÄúJoe Rogan Experience,‚Äù for the past two years. It‚Äôs the most listened to among women. It reportedly averages 5 million weekly listeners.

In the interview, the pair spoke about how a high school friend‚Äôs story of sexual abuse inspired Harris to become the top prosecutor in California.

Content: FEMA has plenty of money for disasters. Congress recently replenished a key source of FEMA‚Äôs response efforts, providing $20 billion for the agency‚Äôs disaster relief fund as part of a short-term government spending bill to fund the government through Dec. 20. The bill also gave FEMA flexibility to draw on the money more quickly as needed.

Content: QUESTION: do you know any people with large audiences / communities? I‚Äôm messaging the public figures I know to listen to the Harris ‚ÄúCall Her Daddy‚Äù interview because the interview highlights what an extraordinary leader Harris is. 

Note: if you know someone who know someone with a large following on any or many platforms, ask them to consider making the request to post about people listening.

Content: Did you hear the ‚ÄúCall Her Daddy‚Äù interview with Harris? If you like it, I would appreciate it if you‚Äôd consider posting on one or all of your socials about it. You have a fan base. You can make a difference for women in this country, I hope you will consider this request and take action today.

The message above is what I sent to people in Hollywood, the video game industry / technology industry. Sent to men and women. I heard about ‚ÄúCall Her Daddy‚Äù from a man on TikTok.

Content: Here's the [official FEMA Rumor Reponse page](<https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response>). Here is [an AP article](<https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-congress-fema-funding-5be4f18e00ce2b509d6830410cf2c1cb>) where Mayorkas says they have enough funding for immediate needs but will run out before the end of the hurricane season. [Here are the Republicans who voted against FEMA funding before Hurricane Helene hit](<https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-voted-against-fema-funding-1963980>). I hope this is helpful in engaging with your friend! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Content: I volunteer with a national non-profit and they have a media kit that one can draw from to use in the profile or banners for different social media platforms - already cut to the size that is needed. I have a facebook banner for Harris that I copied and pasted from somewhere. The quality is just meh. If the campaign had a series of fb banners in a media kit that I can copy and paste from, especially with messaging that they want out at the moment - I'd prefer to do that. Because I'll change my banner weekly or even daily because then it also shows up on my newsfeed that I changed it.

Content: Hey <@1275254288238776421> thank you for flagging! It's normal for people to feel anxious as we get closer to the election, especially with a race that's so close. CNN isn't wrong for posting an article that shares a common feeling across America at this point in time, but I agree with you that it's not really encouraging and not really a vibe we want to perpetuate in these final days!

I will say for myself, I started getting involved in campaign work in 2020 because I was *so anxious*! And volunteering for the campaign was a way to channel that anxious energy into productivity, talking to voters and helping increase turnout! I encourage you to put any anxious energy into volunteering (we appreciate you being here! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> ) and encouraging those you encounter in real life and online to do the same -- we're all on the same team and the only thing that matters is votes. Polls can vary so wildly and aren't always accurate, so let's put our energy into people over polls and make sure we're contacting as many voters as possible! <:happysun1:1270566006590541896>

Content: Another post from Steven Schmidt arguing that any impression that Kamala is following Biden's policies will hurt her, potentially badly (based on surveys). My take is that this just emphasizes how important it is for the campaign to emphasize Kamala's new ideas and policy proposals: https://steveschmidt.substack.com/p/blowing-the-bridge-to-the-past?utm_campaign=email-half-post&r=gc81z&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email

Content: <@1262273567416909829> - I had to delete the links your friend shared because we do not want to support any conspiracy theories in this space, but I wanted to share with you a link my fellow mod <@225877156247502850> helped me to find from CNN on the electoral college.  Generally, we want to share verified news sources or campaign official stuff in this space. We can also share our own creations based on campaign stuff too. It is totally okay to ask questions, but we may have to remove some sources.  That said, please read this article and share it. https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/10/politics/tim-walz-electoral-college/index.html

Content: Hi <@1262273567416909829> ! Jumping in since Jay is off-shift atm... that's a really good question actually!

I realize I'm coming in partway through your conversation, but have you had a chance to attend our Combatting Misinformation event? I think you might find it valuable: https://events.democrats.org/event/620800/

(There's actually a few different versions available - I just searched "misinformation" to see the options.) I hope this helps! It's hard work... but good and necessary!

I'd love to know more about it as I‚Äôm a content creator with a channel focused on reporting current events from a progressive, democratic perspective. My videos mix humor and sharp analysis to poke fun at the GOP and highlight important issues.

Content: Also FB restricted my account without explanation around the beginning of October until the 9th of October. Really wondering if they are right leaning recently. It isn‚Äôt because I argue with Trump supporters or the many fake accounts set up for his mis-information campaign,  because I simply block them.

Content: Are we supposed to put our icebreakers here? favorite moments from the campaign this week? The Detroit ad wrote itself, but I also really liked the event in Arizona with Tim Walz. It's not that hard to show respect for people. Unless you're that other guy, I guess. https://www.c-span.org/video/?539006-1/governor-tim-walz-meets-arizona-native-american-leaders

Content: I have to agree with this. Also, the fact that it was just announced that Bon Jovi is endorsing the campaign was a huge hit for me this week since I love the song they used! (also I like Bon Jovi)

Content: Here is a deep dive into the skewed polls that Trump and the Republicans have been dumping to try to push the narrative that the Harris campaign has stalled or lost ground. This is important to spread widely, to counter the narrative they are trying to push: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBrfyjrg3kI

Content: As much as I support Kamala Harris, I wish she‚Äôd tone down the kumbaya tone and replace it with stronger language tying 45 to a bad economy and women dying.  She blew it in The View when asked about what she would do different from Biden.  It was an important question and she floundered.  It was an opportunity for her to emphasize all the good that‚Äôs been done in the past 4 years and how her policies would expand all this good work.  I‚Äôm completely frustrated that her messaging is not strong enough.

Content: I hear you, it can feel frustrating to consistently be the party taking the higher road when Trump and Project 2025 are blatantly disrespectful and a danger to our communities. At the same time, know that there's a diversity of voters supporting or getting closer to supporting the Vice President, so she is working to appeal to millions of voters, ensuring they all feel as seen and as heard as possible. We'd love to have you share content from [Reach on Project 2025](<https://app.reach.vote/library/label/8fe7a281-3f02-4527-8cd4-e58ba27873ea?campaign=democrats>) with your online communities to help highlight what's at stake!

Content: I reposted a lot of campaign talking points and had some conversations with people about the gravity of the election. My posts garnered views and reposts. My conversations were fruitful. I think people are starting to understand the stakes in this election. I‚Äôm hoping to do another ‚Äúdump‚Äù of campaign talking points this afternoon, but am having issues with my iPhone and need to get that squared away. Will be on a Zoom at 6:00pn EDT.

Still hear that the campaign is not listening, showing respect to non college educated males. Their fears are ignored. It's not simply the right positions, it's how you make people feel. Trump won't fix anything but knows how these voters feel.

While reminding our pro-Democrat U.S. citizens to go out and vote Harris/Walz & Dems up & down the ballotüíôüó≥Ô∏èüíô, let us probe ways to convincing undecided voters to do the same.

Content: INFLATION 

Not sure how successful, but I think this inflation angle gets people thinking.

Where does the inflation money go?

When eggs jump in price overnight the money did not go to the chickens.  When gas jumps the oil in the ground did not change.

Inflation money goes to the rich.

Example: Trump just raised the price of Mar-a-lago membership from $200,000 to $1,000,000.  Did his cost rise 400%, no.  Did Biden get part of that inflation increase, no.  A rich guy, Trump, put it in his pocket.  Who paid?  Well other rich guys paid, but they never really pay, they raised prices!  

Trump, and his buddies, are not the solution, they are the problem.

Need more, check out Trump buddy Musk, Cyber truck, Musk said $40,000 price now it's $100,000 at cheapest that's 150%.  And Musk got a $46 billion, that's $46,000,000,0000 pay package. So why is the electronic car guy buddy buddy with President Fossil Fuel?  He doesn't want it taxed.

So, who pays for the rich trying to stay rich?  American consumers and taxpayers.

Trying to explain using those simple examples to get the truth across.

Content: Guys will see it different.  Abortion for them should be framed from their perspective, either they or their children are trapped in a situation they would like to have a choice on.  Imagine how a father of a rape victim feels about his daughter forced to bear a grandchild from a rapist.

Content: I am getting hit hard about this morning‚Äôs pundits and being on the defensive instead of redirecting journalists and countering with Harris‚Äô very strong unity, family and middle class policies. Where do we post comments about this? I am getting attacked by my local Democrats about not having a strong showing against Trump pundits.

Content: I don't understand why either and I'm way past middle age. My thought is there a subset of men between 30 and 50 who are products of private Christian schools and home schooling where basic biology and sex education didn't exist.

Content: I disagree on sex ed in the 80-90s. I was in public schools and changed schools three times in three years and had to take it again at each school between 5th and 7th grades. It was a quality class that taught basics. Not abstinence.

Content: I‚Äôve found at this point especially Trump voters are deeply immovably entrenched. They may have lost family, friends, coworkers over their devotion to their orange god. Nothing a total stranger posts will sway them. They are particularly resistant to logic and facts.  My focus is on the reachable, perhaps a moveable middle, GOTV and vote curing.

Content: oh absolutely! But I think if the moveable middle goes to Harris‚Äôs facebook page and sees only Trumpers with no dem support or pushback, that can sway them too (in a bad way). My goal has only been to dilute the mis and disinformation that plagues these pages for the sake of the middle and sane Republicans. üòâ

I challenge you to incorporate this texture into whatever you share online or with friends to encourage voting and volunteering.

Content: <@936622618293968958>  my name is Jewelz & I'm kinda new to this channel after being a Twitter rapid response person for Biden Harris 2020.... I was hoping you would be so kind as to point me in the right direction re: possible introduction type channels and/or who I can reach out to re: an offer to help in a similar manner to 2020 if that kind of help is needed. My profile here accepts DMs & on X at @BetoangelMommas

I've spent the time between campaigns as a "sedition hunter" y'all so that X profile might seem odd as I have to be very  anonymous as a result. If it is a concern I will gladly be more transparent via DM if that helps 

I am able to rate community notes & did offer assistance in that channel as well 

hanks so much!

Content: I believe I still have a reddit but will double check-- I have a similar type of acct on Facebook & Instagram for sure. I will check reddit & could start a tik Tok if needed. 

And thank you, I'll  reach out to your rapid response folks as well!  Is there somewhere that folks here are able to share all of their accounts to help connect?

One last weird thing is  I've established  relationships w/ MSM  via my time as a sedition hunter (via RawStory, NY times, WAPO, CNN mainly )

Content: Since Indigenous People's Day FKA Columbus Day is a federal US holiday and we share content as part of our work, please remember that while mocking Columbus and colonization is valid for the historical context, it is not always funny for people impacted. if you share a Columbus mocking meme for awareness,  please consider  following it with a Native-affirming one that does not center Columbus.  Example of resources: https://library.into-action.us/collection/indigenous-peoples-day

Content: Hello everyone! Did anyone experienced Meta Platforms like Instagram or Threads blocking videos or images from being posted? So far I have only be able to share videos or images with key words on: some sub/Reddits, Imgur, Bluesky and Tiktok (this one is tricky, but so far better than any Meta product)

please help me amplify this:

Content: I want outlets like the NYTimes to spend more time with Harris than Trump. I thought this article could use boosting https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/us/politics/harris-trump-weak-and-unstable.html?unlocked_article_code=1.SE4.XoFO.ocsRPOOrLuDi ... So I made a GIF of their video. Love this guy in the audience who is responding to Harris by making the thinking face right after she does

Content: Congress woman @pramilajayapal made this video in Detroit, MI yesterday where she is canvassing! DJT said in a rally this past weekend that he will take away citizenship and the right to #VOTE from naturalized citizens. This is important in so many critical ways to many of us here who have spent our best years in the US building and serving the communities around us! Share widely https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBHJX7BSbbD/

<@936622618293968958> IS THERE ANY VIDEO CLIPPINGS OF TRUMP SAYING THIS THAT THE CAMPAIGN TEAM CAN SHARE? Would be powerful to pair this with her statement

Content: Not yet Autumn! I was directed to this channel to post! Would the campaign have any official statement / clip / approved message regarding DJT‚Äôs statement on repealing naturalized citizens of their citizenship? I saw this which is close: https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-10-10/donald-trump-immigration-repatriados-depression?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3Lz2f6c4Kg-eRvqYmbyqCnPB6c85qXgNfcE8D4tXfAu4d4ep4fz8MKRkM_aem_Ozz9A_Ef_qNncsCyBTLbDQ

Content: I've only seen soundbites about this, like you. Historically, we've seen comments like this for a long time from him... so maybe there are older sources on the web.

Content: When and once Americans stop judging one individual skin tone and look at the outward actions of ones revealing the race for President and it's voting will go smoother...I don't know if mankind is afraid to move forward about the revealing of God's judgements towards America but he intended for all to want to be at least commonly at a stand position of what's already in the making...you don't know that the judging isn't for you to have a want it's the position to uphold the truthfulness of what's to coming...he is very picky about the representation of our Americans and the Republicans need to really step back and allow the way of the American people..and address the common way of recovery before the coming of God..and Madam Kamala Harris thankyou because you are stepping up especially in our time when the life of the innocent had been slain and covered up...I humbly thankyou

Content: Hey there <@770039918977482773>  && <@832229987024633896> !

Thank you both for pointing out the troubling disinformation in re: Our VP Candidate.

The team in <#1260333091319451660> is pushing back and if you'd like to join the effort, head on over there.

Also, we have a training tomorrow about what to do when we come across mis/disinformation online.

https://events.democrats.org/event/676496/

Hang in there. We got this!

What volunteer shifts are you signed up for this week?

The Question is what am I NOT signed up for this week. I got phone bank and friend bank facilitation with this campaign, work with PA Dems on their phone banks (I'm on their leadership team), I'm posting online with OE nonstop, I post with Join The Union PA as a part of their social media team, and I got a phone bank I work on with my own grassroots org that does voter outreach in PA. I think I need to go buy stock in Tim Hortons and Wawa considering all the coffee I'm going to need.

Content: Some business leaders say they don't like Trump, but they like his economic policies vs Harris's policies. Nonsense. Those business leaders are either ignorant of the facts or they are not honest with themselves. Last night's Rachel Maddow show was a brilliant summary of the insanity of business people who support Trump for President. Please communicate part or all of this episode in business-oriented social media such as LinkedIn. Everyone in the business world needs to understand the tremendous advantages of Kamala Harris's plans and the Biden-Harris economy.

Content: Hello everyone! Does someone here uses the Lemmon8 app?! 

I need HELP. I was minding my business and I am swarmed with magats. I have already answered over 200 comments nonstop. The thing is, answering comments regardless of what they are increases profile visibility and make Blue voters in that app feel see and supported. That app is full of magats kids rabidly parroting magat keywords or attacking other kids who understand Democracy. 

No worries, I am answering magats  like this: 
‚Äúsay Trump is you ARE VOTING for KAMALA HARRIS AND TIM WALZ USA USA USA üíôüá∫üá∏ü¶Öüíôüá∫üá∏ and attach images from the Reach app with Harris-Walz Campaing information.‚Äù

OR

‚ÄúComment anything if you VOTE KAMALA HARRIS üíôüá∫üá∏ü¶Öüíôüá∫üá∏ü¶Öüíôüá∫üá∏ü¶Öüíôüíô USA USA USA ‚Äú

OR

‚ÄúOnly AMERICAN PATRIOTS VOTE FOR KAMALA HARRIS üíôüá∫üá∏ü¶Öüíôüá∫üá∏ü¶Öüíôü¶Ö USA USA USA

Even if it looks silly , that's how scrolling through the comments gets automatic attention.

Here my profile. Every post is full of rabid lil‚Äômagats üôÑ

https://v.lemon8-app.com/s/AZQpZsmppR

thank you for helping here üíôüá∫üá∏ü¶Ö

Content: I haven't seen much pushback against the arguments Trump made in his recent interview in Chicago (just some tweets from Aaron Rupar on X) - I think it will be important to challenge his assertions ASAP. I found this article in the NYT which reviews the interview and highlights some of the counter-arguments from professional economists, but it is fairly neutral overall: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-tariffs-economy-economy-club-chicago.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Sk4.wsaG.u7_TEZ8W2ZOe&smid=url-share

Content: To further expound on Purple (MD) post above:   Trump lies, and continues to lie ... in a manner that has led to the highest levels of political violence in more than a generation ... BANNON( Trump's criminally convicted WH advisor, weeks before 2020 election):   "What Trump's gonna do, is just declare victory. Right? He's gonna declare victory. But that doesn't mean he's a winner," Bannon said in the clip, laughing. "He's just gonna say he's a winner."

Later in the audio Bannon says to expect "crazy sh&t" from Trump after the election and that, "at 10 or 11 o'clock Trump's gonna walk in the Oval, tweet out, 'I'm the winner. Game over. Suck on that.'"       https://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-audio-bannon-trump-just-gonna-say-hes-a-winner-2022-7

Content: <:mega2:1269006580976976076> A good way to manage election anxiety feelings that's quick and easy is to help us **spread the word about our candidates on Reddit**! The <#1288163431911788586> team is posting and boosting breaking, informative, and positive <:kamala1:1269028302203523114> + <:WalzSmile:1270424129853456445> news, as well as campaign-generated memes and screenshots of @kamalaHQ social media to turn the tide on Reddit from Orange to Blue. Some of us also counter disinformation, or post call-for-volunteers info. We especially need people who can post at r/politics, r/news, r/technology, r/tiktokcringe, and other large subreddits. Join here: https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1260651617867399188/1260728814540165162 and click the icon for Reddit (last option).

Content: Hello, is there any way I can suggest something to be amplified as a talking point? Trump made a recent admission that he would try to ban video games, which would be an ***extremely heavy*** motivator for Gen Z to turn out against him, even for the politically disengaged.

Content: Hey <@814685350529597450> in addition to what RJ and others recommended for down ballot, we do always recommend state dot gov sites for state specific items. Mostly, this should be in the AZ channel also.  Server mod note:  We always caution about outside sources about voting. https://azdem.org/

Content: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve suspected that you‚Äôre yelling into a void about the election on Instagram, Facebook or Threads, it might not be your imagination, either. Downplaying politics is a business and political strategy from Meta, the social media giant. And users just have to accept it.‚Äù

Content: Come on over to Reddit.  And help us amplify the campaign.  

<:mega2:1269006580976976076> A good way to manage election anxiety feelings that's quick and easy is to help us **spread the word about our candidates on Reddit**! The <#1288163431911788586> team is posting and boosting breaking, informative, and positive <:kamala1:1269028302203523114> + <:WalzSmile:1270424129853456445> news, as well as campaign-generated memes and screenshots of @kamalaHQ social media to turn the tide on Reddit from Orange to Blue. Some of us also counter disinformation, or post call-for-volunteers info. We especially need people who can post at r/politics, r/news, r/technology, r/tiktokcringe, and other large subreddits. Join here: https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1260651617867399188/1260728814540165162 and click the icon for Reddit (last option).

Content: <@947516905386831902> and others: Not that this is that big of a deal, but I promised to make a post discussing form of engagement here, so this is my attempt.  This does not tick all the boxes as it is not original content, nor is it particularly pro-Kamala, but it is cleverly anti Trump, and that I like. This is my personal Facebook (digital creator profile), but I also shared it to Harris for Texas (official space) where we limit Trump content deliberately. Too easy to get sucked into mocking him, commiserating etc. We need our energy for other things. However, I am pleased with the number of reactions and shares. That is rare. I shared the other meme responses, as I did not want to share any names here, as a point of privacy.

Content: Hi <@892601853873905697> 

The beauty of sharing content from Reach is you can also pull tag ideas from the suggested copy and/or the content category. By doing so, you can improve any SEO organically and increase the chances your post will get picked up by the platform's algorithm.

You can find suggested copy and content categories by clicking share and scrolling down the popup tab.

Lastly, I tend to use tags more often on Twitter, Instagram, Threads, Blue Sky, and TikTok vs. Facebook, but that is more about how I use that platform vs. the others.

LMK if you have further questions!

Content: No, i didn't see the interview!  She's REALLY making up for people "not knowing" her!  But i think she needs to pick a specific character & go with it, even if it's just skin deep, because this country has learned its politics in all the wrong ways, and that's why i've been calling her "Mamala" all over the socials..

Content: I‚Äôve been going through my contacts in reach. I‚Äôve contacted friends and family in battleground states. Some people say they‚Äôve voted already but the app doesn‚Äôt reflect that. It would be nice for there to be a way to indicate that someone says they‚Äôve voted (by mail) already (to focus resources on people who haven‚Äôt and/or to come back to them at a later date). It‚Äôs great to reconnect with people I haven‚Äôt talked to in a while. A little bittersweet: friends have kids who are old enough to vote in their first election.  They‚Äôre excited but that means I‚Äôm officially middle aged now which is not ok.

Content: Fake Video of Mathew Metro: Thanks Ann! Your debunking looks good -- perhaps shorten it?.  Hope it is not needed now since there is now a community note [ reader added context] attached to the fake video. It should also be attached to similar posts, but I have not checked. The twitter-community-notes group worked to get the note attached  https://x.com/Alphafox78/status/1846671897838178748

Content: I'm not the most well informed in AI, but I definitely think it's important to highlight and call out misinformation! You might consider turning this into a TikTok video as well, or starting a series calling out the mis and disinformation from Trump's campaign throughout this election

Content: <:mega2:1269006580976976076> A good way to manage election anxiety feelings that's quick and easy is to help us **spread the word about our candidates on Reddit**! The <#1288163431911788586> team is posting and boosting breaking, informative, and positive <:kamala1:1269028302203523114> + <:WalzSmile:1270424129853456445> news, as well as campaign-generated memes and screenshots of @kamalaHQ social media to turn the tide on Reddit from Orange to Blue. Some of us also counter disinformation, or post call-for-volunteers info. We especially need people who can post at r/politics, r/news, r/technology, r/tiktokcringe, and other large subreddits. Join here: https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1260651617867399188/1260728814540165162 and click the icon for Reddit (last option).

Content: Heather continues to provide crucial commentary: "Trump wants to get rid of the current government so that he can enrich himself, do whatever he wants to his enemies, and avoid answering to the law. The Christian nationalists who wrote Project 2025 want to destroy the federal government so they can put in place an authoritarian who will force Americans to live under religious rule. Tech elites like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel want to get rid of the federal government so they can control the future without having to worry about regulations.

Content: I am trying to recruit people on facebook to sign up for events. one of my friends sent this feedback, which I thought I would pass on. "There is only one thing causing me to not want to bother to vote, and all I have to do is fill out a ballot and drop in the mail - the overwhelming amount of spam. Calls, emails, texts. Perhaps it's just me, but there is nothing more annoying than getting hundreds of these per week. Hundreds. I believe it is counterproductive."

Content: The sooner they vote, the sooner they will stop being contacted. In my personal opinion, that's a poor reason not to vote. A lot of people care about it to make those calls, emails, and texts, and it's easy to unsubscribe from each one

Until we hear anything official, this might be enough to counter your concerned friends and family.

Also: Generally speaking, when tracing the source follow the money and metadata.

Content: Sorry for the delay reply <@822179761988042792>. You are welcome to use what feels natural for you in terms of direct messaging for grassroots social media. Of course, you will need to bear in mind general courtesy. 1) Assume the best intentions. 2. Practice default respect. No profanity or shaming of anyone regardless of differences. 3. Remain focused on Kamala Harris, Tim Walz and the positive momentum of the campaign.  4. Pivot when you encounter Mis-Info.

Content: Yes, please avoid super intense experiences and be mindful of how challenges are discussed.  We also don't want self promotion or promotion of other orgs.  Sharing your socials is okay, but no pressure to subscribe or share in this space.  PS: In addition, I would encourage you to post it on your personal social media, and then when you are here in this space, talk about the response you got or the process of creating it.  Finally, how does this personal story inform your activism related to our campaign? Thanks.

Content: Possible Meme Seed: Mocking Trump's Playlist vs Uplifting Kamala's Playlist. Doing a short reel split screen. One side is for Trump's portion to feature only silly lip-synching and captions as we don't want to include the actual music or artists, since it is not them we are mocking.  On Kamala's side of course, we can have sound and images, which is more appealing.  I am not a video maker, but I think that would be a creative way to show a contrast.  ü§ì

I wasn't sure where to put this, so I'm adding it here. It's a general shortened version of what I say when I talk to friends, family, and randoms about the election. It's resulted in Trump supporters choosing not to vote this year, and independents voting for Kamala and dem Senators

Content: Starting off by being clear about election info opens the door pretty wide, even if the person doesn't support Kamala/Dems. Offering to help directly is sometimes taken as a very positive thing, and sometimes very suspicious, so I have state-level resources and links they might trust (AARP for example) ready. 

Inserting Trump's harmful behavior as a natural on-the-spot thought of disgust flows well and doesn't feel like a canned speech. By the time they realize I'm giving one, they're hearing things that make them think, and they appreciate it even if they still want to vote for Trump or are undecided. 

I don't press them if they react negatively or with disinterest, because my purpose is to plant a seed of thought and prevent them from feeling like they're being attacked and need a savior no matter what it is (Trump).

They leave the interaction grateful for the info (especially if they were going to vote twice, or didn't know the rules) and respecting that I have reasonable values and I'm not pushing anything down their throat. 

If the person agrees with me or shows interest in voting, I reiterate how useful talking to friends and family about the info can be, and offer to text them some bullet points about what I said and why Kamala (and their congressional reps) are good for their personal life (e.g. tax breaks, healthcare, medical freedom). If they want that text and seem to be convinced to vote Kamala-Walz I offer to tell them how to make calls anonymously like I am, and offer to add that info to a text I send them too.

Content: I think this artist has been influencing her audience on the issues of rising food price, and farmers dignity. I added an expansion on her story and she liked it. I told her Kamala-Walz would be focusing on rising prices of essentials, foods, in-home healthcare, dignity for the farmers, workers alike. Which is vital for developing local economies. Trump is for the Billionaires and they don't care about the rise in food prices or any daily essentials which would profit his billionaires. This leads to broken families and eventually increases homelessness in the sociaty. I told her these things and she wants to, maybe consider writing further on this, it seems by her engagements with the idea. I don't like mocking Texans because they are all Trump and Elon Musk fans. Telling them the plans would help them, atleast understand that Kamala-Walz is a better option for them. I think so.

Content: I can‚Äôt use fb, so I had to wait for someone else to post this where I could get it. They have made a lot of ads, if this can be trusted at all.  This is from the Musk scam Progress 2028.

Content: Like this is an ad I have been running with the viewers on my own stories. The former has been one of the positive responses I have got so far, to continue to work together. She can help influence voters, I think so, on grassroots engagements or even run ads on local concerts.

Content: The plus to using these are they shift the burden onto Trump's record on the subject. These are not feelings/value/hypothetical based statements, just facts.

Content: BTW saw this reaction on twitter, too. Again I am not saying to stop mind you, just posting feedback so people are aware of it. My friend is going to return his ballot but his line was "I didn't consent to harassment."

It drives me and my spouse nuts that we get so many messages a day, but we figure they must work (or I hope they do) else they wouldn't send them constantly. I have worried that they're turning some people off though.

Content: Simon Rosenberg did a deep dive on his Hopium site today into red wave polling and polymarket today. It seems to me this is extremely important. The Republicans are using these tactics to drive the narrative that Trump is ahead and will win. Partly this may be aimed at justifying another "stop the steal" campaign if he loses. But it is also something that can negatively depress turnout among Harris voters, which is a potentially serious problem: https://open.substack.com/pub/simonwdc/p/vp-harris-and-her-campaign-are-working?r=gc81z&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email

Content: Thanks for posting - this is from Nate Silver, who Rosenberg argues is biased (I'm don't know how strong the evidence for that is). Silver admits that Republican polls are biased, but argues they are not strongly biased. This actually fits with Rosenberg's argument - he is saying they are trying to be very incremental, so that the bias is not noticed, but there is a cumulative effect on the aggregated results. He argues they did the same thing in 2022 but on a shorter timescale (because they started later), so they had to increase the bias which made it more noticeable (and there was a large discrepancy between the predicted "red wave" and what actually happened that year). The other key factor (according to Silver) is whether the various modelers posting aggregated summaries are properly adjusting for bias. Silver claims they are, whereas Rosenberg thinks they are not. Silver argues that all the modelers adjust, but do so with different methods, yet come to similar conclusions. I don't have a paid subscription so I couldn't read the complete article and so cannot comment on how convincing Silver's arguments are concerning the adjustments made by the modelers.

Content: Hi <@1296744051382419477> - Happy to help you get Reach content if that is a problem with Reach access. However, the first two areas I suggest are <#1252676126698897429> and <#1250876565366243348> . Reach is a tool, but it is not necessary. You can craft your own posts and discuss them here anytime.

Content: <@1296744051382419477> : As far as how to post a short film, I would recommend posting it to your site first and sharing the social site link here in OE with a blurb about the film. I am sure you thought of this answer of course. Just confirming here that you cannot upload stuff directly for safety etc. üôÇ

Content: I finshed my AI pdf (took me a couple days) I think its "all done" now (after a couple rounds of proofreading and some tweaks) That said if anyone decides to read it and sees anything I should fix, let me know. If it is fine, people can feel free to give it out however you like to whoever you like ‚ù§Ô∏è It's longer, but I intended to make it as an overall informational thing (what is AI, how do people use it, how can you spot it etc)

Content: It can go the other way too. During 2016, the polls being so far ahead for Clinton, and the expectations set so much that she'd win meant some Democrats stayed home. 

I stopped looking at polls TBH. They might help campaigns spot where to deploy resources (or not) but for me they're just anxiety ridden click bate that feeds my addictive personality.

Content: On this channel (I think) earlier this evening.  Someone had taken a screenshot of a conversation about Elon Musk buying votes.  The OP wanted someone to check it out. This might have been what the OP was referring to: from the NYT https://apnews.com/article/musk-1-million-giveaway-trump-voters-petition-b4e48acbfe04fde735e60b1911ad0197

Content: Lead Jared (Ky) suggested I forward my inquiry to this channel. I want to respond with to my friend (even though she is pro Trump, she is engaging in conversation with me on Facebook as well as direct messaging). Please provide some key points to respond to the video. Also, why would Facebook be taking the video down? Thx

Content: A quick personal story, if I may?
My first career was law-adjacent. I was a discovery lead in civil/class-action lawsuits here in my home state of California. Often, this meant I was tracking down documents and/or people who didn't want to be found and once I did, ensuring that evidence/testimony/affadavits were shared with all attorneys of record.

Something I learned then that is applicable today: Follow the money. Follow the story (or metadata/digital footprints).

Fortunately, and in this case, I didn't have to dig that far. I looked into who produced the video and what any incentive might be. Unfortunately, I question its validity and its timing; this video you shared is the second in a week with a dubious provenance with the intent to cast doubt (or worse) on the character of our candidates. I am not going to link what I found because I do not want to drive traffic/eyeballs to those sites.

Your friend isn't ready. She may never be. At this point, you may consider what you want to do with this relationship and/or what is safe and reasonable for you both.

FWIW: I'm sorry.

Content: <@1287936556937773090> just stick to the facts. But chances are, you aren't going to change her mind so don't spend too much time on it. Most times they don't want to be convinced, they're just wasting your time so you're not out there doing other good things

Content: I love these clips. Thanks. When I copy the link and paste in Facebook, my only social media, all you get is the address to the link, no photo. Don‚Äôt think people are likely to click on the web link without the image. Am I doing it wrong?

Content: Sorry for the delay, I didn't see this yesterday! In these last 2 weeks before the election, we've shifted our focus from interacting with online communities to reaching out to the voters in our lives and making sure they have everything they need to get out the vote. Because of that, we don't have our survey in Reach anymore, but you can report back on individual interactions within your contact's profile on Reach!

If you're not sure how to access your contacts in Reach or want more guidance on how to have these conversations, sign up for our [GOTV Bootcamp](<https://events.democrats.org/event/703304/>) or our [GOTV Power Hour](<https://events.democrats.org/event/721238/>) <:happysun1:1270566006590541896>

Content: I'm going on a posting spree for the last little bit as a way of reaching folks across my platforms in these last two weeks. My followers on all platforms lean pretty left anyway but fingers crossed I can get some mobilization going that wouldn't already be there.

Content: This is an amazing post from a well-known lawyer. He makes the case that Trump would end the rule of law, which would destroy much of what is great about our country: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bTpbDL5dcg

I don't get it. Pls have Dr. Bandy X Lee forensic psychiatrist at one of your rallies to speak about the Trump Contagion and the dangers of Donald Trump! Pls! She will do it! Her and 44 other psychiatrists from Harvard and Yale are trying to get the word out but they have being squashed. Let's let them speak the truth about the mental health other Republican candidate and the danger we will all be in if the unspeakable happens. üíôüá∫üá∏

Content: An in-depth look at the Polymarket betting market (a platform created by Peter Thiel). Right after Elon Musk claimed that betting markets are the best predictors of elections, four massive bets (totaling 30 million dollars, possibly from one person) were placed. This had a huge effect on the odds - this is blatant manipulation! Polymarket is being used as a vehicle for deception to bolster the Republican narrative on this election! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1INviKkv7-c

This is equivalent to what James Comey did to Hillary in 2016 (it‚Äôs actually worse, but not sure it will be as impactful.)

Content: It is nice to hear Kamala dating this, but it would be good if Trump‚Äôs former staffers are seen saying this. I posted on my Facebook last night. Here is Trump‚Äôs communications director, saying she was in Oval office when Trump.l said he wanted you to use military American citizens.

Content: Thank you <@861754434879094797> - You said:  This is a text I received and I was supposed to send it to disinformation at DNC but I couldn‚Äôt find a way to do it so I thought I‚Äôd put it out here so it might get to the right place.  I replied: I will send this for you.  Sorry you had to deal with that.  By the way,  have you attended our Dealing with Misinformation training? It sounds like you may have, but sharing for others. https://events.democrats.org/event/676496/.  Finally, I removed the image from this channel after saving it because it did have a full phone number on there.  We want to not share that for safety reasons.  I forwarded the image to disinfo@dnc.org.  Please save that email address for future use.  Thank you.

Content: Sorry, but it looks like you don't need to bother. I just looked it up and this is from 2019 after a couple of mass shootings. Not particularly relevant to what we need now and could muddy the waters on a fact check.

Content: <@1113556708342636656> has a great idea to design a profile frame, or ideally several for some variety.  "Can someone create a Facebook profile frame and put it on the Facebook Frame choice area?   Nothing specifically there for Harris-Walz yet." Thanks, Katherine.

Content: I love the REACH app and it's on my phone and computer. I am a former Republican and live in a blue dot/red state. I have many GOP friends and family. I've found the best way to "convert" Independent and Republican friends and family is to SHOW them what Trump, Vance and other Republicans are saying.  I created a Substack that shows the latest videos, articles and links so they can make up their minds.  Here is the Substack link - https://notdadsgop.substack.com

Content: I have successfully infiltrated (lol) several Trump supporting social media sites.
I have been engaging in meaningful conversations about WHY I am not voting for Trump. A win is when I inform them that he wants to dissolve the department of education and because of his convoluted laws regarding the border, he has allowed more people to cross into the United States. 
I need feedback though- 
Many of my friends are Jewish and they are voting for Trump based solely on the fact they believe he will save Israel. Despite the fact that he has angers many world leaders.
What else can I tell them besides Kamala‚Äôs stance on Israel, and the fact Doug is Jewish? 
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful job! Kamala for the Win!!

Content: It is more about the fact that several Muslims in office are what scares them. I tell them about Islamophobia as a form of racism, but they lump all Muslims into being terrorist. I find supporting documents to prove there are not radical Muslims in the party, but they don‚Äôt believe me. Many think they all are members of BDS, which they are not supporters of, and don‚Äôt support UNWRA.

Content: <@853021260849479740> Bill Maher on RealTime New Rules did a good segment against the far left. Still the vast majority of Democrats support Israel. I think there's equivalents on the far right to our far left and maybe you could equate that. There are lots of extremists on the far right and you have some people who don't want a genocide on our far left. Maybe that's oversimplifying, but a Harris administration seems to me will be very centrist.

This does a great job of telling people how and why zionists are not colonizers, and why Israel is not committing genocide when I speak to others who bring up Israel.

Content: This is a **big tent** which includes individuals with different opinions. We are here because we believe Kamala Harris will be great president, and we will focus on that shared belief instead of debating other's opinions. 
We are in this together. Let's be united in our common goal and work to get Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the White House.

Content: Is anyone running into issues with being majorly suppressed by Instagram?? I went from 40-80 views per story to 1-2 views per story in ONE DAY. And that‚Äôs even with me posting around the same time each day. I don‚Äôt have any community violations. I didn‚Äôt post anything weird. Just Kamala stuff from HQ and from progressive influencers. This is also not due to lack of interest from my followers‚ÄîI get good engagement when my stories are actually shown.

Content: Hey there <@875215876515823676> !

I'm not sure if the below was posted here or in another channel, but it might be relevant:
https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2024/09/30/upcoming-2024-restriction-period-for-us-ads/

While we're not in the restriction period yet, they could be using existing content as a training model for Meta AI. This could cause latency and/or throttle your content going out to your followers.

If you haven't already, save your post and redo it with one thing different--preferably less political. Then post both at roughly the same time and watch the performance. Doing so is a way to split test with the intention to rule out a shadow ban.

Content: The student loan forgiveness is not talked about much online. We should be doing much because the students now have a chance to build with their own after their loans were failed.

Content: <@205092094774214657> - Thanks for posting here. If anyone wants to do so, they can attempt to re-direct to Kamala positive stuff in the comments. Ideally, we would have small teams of dedicated engagers on each platform with others to review and coach. For now, those who want to engage can use Reach content and official socials content to attempt to re-direct. Thanks again.

Content: Remember how hitler rose to power in a then-democratic Germany in the 30‚Äôs, by the fact that 30% of Germans ignored the rise of the nazis! Let‚Äôs not make the same mistake.

Content: First of all, if you can peek into their posting history to see if they have any opening for persuasion.  

Then, start with acknowledging them.  "I understand, the system sucks and we never seem to get candidates we can agree with on 100% of the issues"   

Then, break down the lie... "The Dems don't control the House, and legislation to reinstate Roe V Wade must go through the house."   

Then close with positive... "Kamala Harris has fought her entire career for the people and will place reproductive rights at the top of her agenda."

Content: Right off the bat.. abortion laws and opinions are wildly different between the parties. One is fighting to maintain reproductive rights and the other tearing it apart based on personal feelings.

Content: Its totally understandable to be burnt out with the world we're in right now... but things won't change unless people stand up and say ENOUGH. TX, for example, isn't a red state... it is a state with the majority not voting. If we could get them voting.... and with a view of a positive future filled with joy... imagine what that could change? Now imagine doing that in every state?! How great a world we could live in! We have to keep hope for the future and help others do the same.  If not, that person is right and things won't ever get better.

Content: So, I have been spending most of my campaign time in Reddit.  Lately, I have been scrolling through comments looking for ways to engage persuadable voters.   This post in the Pennsylvania subreddit has mostly postive comments, but saddly, the negative ones seemed beyond persuasion.  

So, instead, I found several opportunities to motivate "already voted" folks for volunteering.  It produced a couple of really great exchanges.  So, in the end, very worthwhile.

CNN found out that Fox edited the video about Trump's barbershop interview. Therefore, Trump's no income tax was just a hoax. In addition, Trump's rambling speech pattern raised questions about his mental decline.

Content: That was my initial thought. Then I realized they were just dooming from Ohio. I encouraged them to find other ways of taking action and they said they were likely to still vote for Harris anyway. The big thing was to avoid vote scolding them as you're right they were kinda looking for a fight. Refusing to give it to them defused the situation.

Content: His supporters are basically abuse victims at this point and that abuse does something to people. And beyond his core base there's far too many people who mistake that for strength and leadership. We've gotta put out as much as we can to break through.

Content: I've been blitzing my socials with information about the current situation. I'm an over achiever so I got 3 big ones I can share
* I amplified Harris's rally tonight sharing the link to the PBS feed of it
* I shared an article by independent journalists talking about how and why the latest sexual assault accusations against Trump and his connections to Epstein matter
* I highlighted the importance of abortion with a Reach app graphic along personal thread about how my mother's choice to keep me when doctors were told she couldn't even sustain a child until it would survive is the kind of thing that a different woman would've chosen to have an abortion about and they would've been right to and how my mother used the story about her decision to show me why someone else making a different one would've still been okay and equally as valid.

I have been doing bilingual phone banking since I have a skill set for that.  But I can‚Äôt do that now my work days, so I‚Äôm doing some social media posts too using Reach app and my own posts about the news.  Being in this Discord group really gives me support to keep at it! I really care about fighting for Democracy and our basic human rights.  Just trying to figure out what I can do to help us beat MAGA.  We will Win!!! üíôüíôüíôüåäüåäüåä

The claim that Dems are moving farther to the right is false‚ÄîBiden's been the most progressive Dem we've had in decades. I wish these folks understood better how the govt works.

Content: Hi again.  Well I downloaded the Reach app and was going to upload my video to the Wisconsin site (I heard they were having troubles there) but alas I have to shrink the video from 7 minutes to 3 minutes. I am trying to figure it out on the fly with the video editor but I keep crashing and burning. 
Is there someone here who is fantastic at video editing who could help me shrink this video while keeping the message intact? 
If not, no worries, I will keep playing around with it.
The video link is at 11:38 am Eastern in this channel.

Content: Whichever way you think looks better. 
I would like to keep the beginning up until I say "Google it". Then my reference to the acronym T.E.A.M (Together  Everyone Achieves More) and then my reference and story about the special forces on to the end.
If you could do this, it would be amazing and so appreciated. Thank you.

Content: Nice vid.  Title is not too harsh.  

The audio is weird in the second half.  Maybe just use the first half and then add the very end?  

Do you have social media accounts that you can post to?  tiktok maybe?

Content: Question for everyone: I have been made aware that there are people in You Tube saying that when Kamala told some people chanting, apparently, in support of Jesus while she was talking about the Supreme Court Court overturning Roe v Wade and its ramifications, she told them "they were at the wrong rally." I have a friend who is truly undecided about who to vote for and what she saw on You Tube about this bothers her a great deal as she thinks that Kamala was mocking Christians. What do I say to her and what actions of Kamala I can point to in order to win her vote?

Content: Hey There <@913060026950746133> !

This has been debunked. Harris was responding to hecklers and as security was escorting them out, they continued shouting but a different set of phrases.

Harris is a woman of faith and she has spoken about it throughout the campaign.

If you have access to Reach, there may be some content to share from there which could be helpful to continue the discussion.

I think that you are watching a misleading youtube video. Harris was responding to pro-life protesters, not the person who yelled Jesus is Lord.
From the video of KTSM9 NEWS, you could find out that the crowds of people were very noisy, so Harris might not hear the word Jesus is Lord or Jesus is King.

Content: If you listen carefully to the video you can hear someone in the crowd yelling "lies." (The White House transcript quoted "Lies. Lies. That's a lie.") It was then that Vice President Harris told them they were at the wrong rally. Their Jesus chanting occurred afterward.

Content: <@771458641277878303> - I am no expert.  Some tips come to mind. 1) Use a great photo or video image with your post.  2) Keep it short, whether written or spoken words.  Asking questions is a great method of inviting engagement. 3) Tag people to share it, either in the post or in comments.  4) Add topical hashtags to make it searchable.  5) When people like it, react and comment.  Invite them to like your content. 6) Find related content feeds, groups or pages to share it to that have a wider audience.  Be careful of any rules.  üôÇ

Content: I wish we had more specific times for you. I think youre probably good with after 8pm. She's the headliner so I also wouldn't expect her on before then (especially based on what we've seen with her other events).

Content: Hey Guys, I work in digital marketing and I think the media generally doesn't do a great job of being critical of Trump because they too often try to just focus on the latest crazy thing instead of putting everything into a broader exhaustive context, and doing that in a simple and visual way. It's really difficult for people to hold all of the craziest bits of the last 8+ years in their short term memory. The New York Times has some decent visualizations but usually these projects are behind their paywall.

So one of the thoughts I had was to create a site that shows conservative "reviews" of Trump in a visual way almost like looking at product reviews or something...I didn't have time to do that, but I did put this together which could be posted as a single layout or as social posts. Any thoughts and would anyone happen to have decent social reach for something like this? A dedicated "Trump Job References" social timeline would be cool, but probably difficult to build followers for an account like that account in a short time.

Content: For anyone canvassing, making calls, texting, and talking to family, friends, and neighbors: immigration is a top issue that comes up. This week, US border patrol confirmed illegal crossings are now as low as they were at the end of the Trump administration. I was surprised by that stat myself! Here is a link to the news story: https://www.cbsnews.com/video/illegal-border-crossings-fall-lowest-level-since-2020/

Content: The illegal crossings issue isn't as salient in my circles as countering the narrative that Harris is just as right wing on immigration as Trump is. We know it's a lie but the general consensus is that the border bill she's pledged to sign is still a bad bill. That said I've seen other commentary that the bad parts are all rhetoric and the actual bill INCREASES immigration overall. Anybody got a breakdown on that I can share?

Reach Libary is a resource for sharing content to other platforms and sharing via personal text if you prefer. However, we do not use that chat feature that I know of, at least not now.  Thanks so much.

Content: Do you have each "reference" as a single image file?  

I think Reddit might be a good place for this.  We build the channel, post each image as a separate post, and do some crossposting to get eyeballs.   Could be fun.

Good early catch! You're not the only one who uploaded their videos to YT and then realized hashtags would help an audience find the video.

There are a couple of ways to do this including having them appear next to your title or along with your video's description. This can be done as you're uploading or after the fact in YouTube Studio.

I found this video helpful:
https://youtu.be/Z4MQu3vOT0g?si=UO_NS_f6hsB66GUN

As to which hashtags to use, ask yourself what your video is about and put yourself in someone else's shoes and ask yourself what is it you're looking for. You can also search various hashtags to see what is popular and/or what fits your video's vibe.

Good luck and have fun!

Content: Hi <@&1250537336639586325>  !! We are **1.9 million calls short of our 10 million calls goal for the weekend! **To help us close this gap--we need YOU to blast our message on social media and ask people to sign up for our phonebank tonight!! I have attached some graphics that you can use for this effort, and our ask is this:

1. Include one of these graphics in any post you create. 
2. Include this link: https://events.democrats.org/event/734916/?utm_source=DiscordBoost in every post you make so people who see it can sign up! 
3. Link the posts you make here so that other folks can amplify the message on their own socials!!!!
4. Make an ask about signing up to phonebank with us in the posts you create!

THANKS FOR THE HELP ALL!!!

Content: I know it sounds trivial, but it's not. The movie was built to analyze debates between conservative and liberal factions and what really matters.  It's a lot easier to drag folks into an experience then through the mud of campaign rhetoric.

Content: I hope I am in the right place for this. A friend posted this on Facebook. It's a long, long list of who is related to whom among Democrats making a case for all of us being related so the system is rigged. Then it goes into the  voting machines are owned by Doug Emhoff's company so you can't trust them and then he ends up making a pitch to Christians to vote. https://www.facebook.com/share/p/UwYcZSNz1tkrbHsU/

Content: Day 3 of learning video editing from the School of Google.
I made this short from my original video. It is rough but I think it gets the message across.

Content: <@1278394720778850393> -Yes, as far as Reach content for DNC, it will be US House and US Senate in the state tagged sections. You can always check out supporter content channel here and look for stuff by issue tag in Reach. Some of that is state based.

Content: Quick idea for direct contact: for those who do shares from Reach, Campaign Socials, Supporter Content or original content, maybe try sharing via direct message or small group as opposed to your general feed, if you are not already doing this. Another option is to text to any friends not on social media. <@1280619651029798924>  and an OE leads that want to add ideas.

Content: Hey there <@1108035867462864906> !

I'm going to echo what one of our server mods said in one of our general channels: All gas, no brakes for the next eight days and thus, no room for distractions.

I've been impressed with your ability to find thought-provoking content to amplify and uplift throughout our online channels, and our efforts have yielded some small amount of public trust.

Can I ask you to turn your insight into finding articles which might highlight perseverance, resilience, and voter turn out?

Content: Did noone catch what Jason Miller said during that "rally" last night?: "America is for Americans and Americans Only". That is a very close translation of the famous Nazi phrase "Deutschland den Deutschen, Auslander Raus!" ("Germany for the Germans, Foreigners Out!"). How ironic that it was uttered by a (self-hating) Jew. Is there some way to get more exposure to this? This was not by accident.
