I thought I was posting it to twitter-community-notes where I hang out most of the time.  Am not seeing the news channel right now but will look more. Am new so need to learn more about purpose of each channel ðŸ˜Ž

I can't find the message now, but maybe you've seen it? I thought it was on online-engagement. I did a search. MANY right-wing outlets reported on the supposed ties 3 days ago, e.g. Fox News https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-walz-ties-muslim-cleric-antisemitic-views-gave-state-funding-group-report Does not look like the ties are very direct. One time the cleric helped Walz calm protesters. Walz supported the Muslim community in many ways https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2024/08/06/five-faith-facts-tim-walz-lutheran-248512 Perhaps someone can create a message about the true nature of the ties -- Walz did not support any anti-semitic views."
