Content: Unfortunately with such a compressed timeline, we need VPOTUS and Gov Walz where they are most needed: battlegrounds like NC, GA, AZ, NV, MI, WI, PA. Mail-in ballots get sent out in NC in about a month and we need to make sure those votes are for this great ticket.

Content: If you‚Äôre able to travel out of state, Nevada and Arizona need our help! You can go to events.democrats.org and filter by organization ‚Äú2024 NV Victory‚Äù or ‚ÄúArizona Democrats - Jumpstart AZ‚Äù to sign up for events. Las Vegas has canvassing for out-of-state volunteers every weekend. Here‚Äôs a link for the first weekend you are off. They have them earlier too if you‚Äôre available on weekends sooner 

(Also, hi! I am currently located in MA but lived in California for 8+ years, my car and most of my belongings and friends are still in CA!)

Content: I found this event on events.democrats.org by filtering location to near Reno, NV. This is hosted by 2024 NV Victory. I would recommend signing up and then at the very least you‚Äôll receive their contact information and you can always plan on another date with them. They are hosting tons of other activities too if you check the website!

Content: Yes absolutely! You can go to events.democrats.org and filter using the "near" field and type in whatever city/town you're interested in going to, and you'll find a list of events you can sign up for there. You can also filter by "type" and select canvasses. To find official campaign events only, you can filter by organization (2024 NV Victory or Arizona Democrats - Jumpstart AZ). Let me know if you need help.

Content: I don't know of any organized groups doing bus trips from CA so far. In the meantime, I would recommend signing up for one of the canvassing events in an area of a swing state you're interested in going to, and once you RSVP you will get contact info and maybe you can reach out to them and ask if they know of any CA groups organizing transport or housing. Where were you hoping to go to? Las Vegas has some canvassing events specific to out-of-staters: https://events.democrats.org/event/670562/

Content: In my home, in the Berkeley flats, watching the next President of the United States speak about the community that raised her... I was already fired up, but that has brought tears.  I am looking at that link for Volunteering in Las Vegas ^^^^   Maybe spend some time in Arizona too.   Is Oregon solid blue?

Content: Hi fellow golden staters, I‚Äôm phone banking for my first time Monday. Looking forward to it, but it‚Äôs done from the comfort of my home. 

I‚Äôm looking for something more social/group oriented. Am I able to lookup my nearest Harris/Walz office and show up and to volunteer‚Ä¶ or are they so busy that I‚Äôd just be contributing to the chaos? 

I‚Äôm in San Diego if that‚Äôs worth anything.

CA made 50% of the GOTV calls for the Clinton campaign in 2016 and they did have offices and staff assigned to CA for out state calling.

Content: I get it. As voting starts 9/6 in NC! postcarding starts to decrease in importance and direct voter contact with phone banks and canvassing increases in importance.  Have you considered maybe using a weekend to knock on doors in NV or AZ or for one of the critical congressional races?  But there are postcarding options still if that's what is best for you! https://www.fieldteam6.org/postcarding1  this one you do on your own.  There's also the CA Democratic party website list of events - just search for San Francisco. https://www.mobilize.us/cadems/?address=San%20Francisco%2C%20CA%2C%20USA&lat=37.7749295&lon=-122.4194155

I'll be in Indianapolis for a conference at the end of September but I don't suppose that's worth looking into?

(Unfortunately I won't be visiting my dad in PA until after the election.)

Content: Oh and if you have a connection to PA then def look for Harris events that are CALLING PA, or Harris events reaching out to PA. You'd be a huge help as someone who knows PA.

Content: Hello Los Angeles, folks! 

I‚Äôm hoping to connect with folks that would be interested in putting together ‚Äúpop-up karaoke and dine‚Äù Kamala fundraisers? 

I‚Äôve already reached out to one restaurant, that might be interested, once they know more information. 

Thought it would be fun to try to hit up as many restaurants around LA, to also drive business back to the restaurants. 

The strikes not only impacted the writers, and actors, but the entire community. 

A sample flier is attached. 

Cheers!

Content: Hey fellow Californians! Reminder that Presidents need a functional House and Senate to govern, and the path to the House runs through California this year. 
CA-13, CA-22, CA-27, CA-41, CA-45 are top potential flips, and CA-47 (Katie Porter‚Äôs former district) is a must-win seat for Dems. 
If you‚Äôre in LA area, for example, consider a day trip to canvass in CA 41, 45, and 47!

Content: I have been organizing my friends to come together and post card. I get addresses from Activate America (https://www.activateamerica.vote/postcards) and send out an invite to my friend group. You can order postcards from Amazon and just get stamps from the post office. It has been a great way to catch up with friends I typically only see in passing.

Content: Hey Everyone. Just a curious question. Has anyone heard from the Schiff campaign for the US Senate run? They have a Slack channel, but it has been pretty silent for the last few months.

Content: Thanks, Carolyn. I believe I signed up with those links before and it directed me to the campaign Slack.

I guess I was curious if the campaign is active since as a lot of people on the Slack have not heard anything from the Schiff campaign since the primary election.

We have several red candidates running against our Dems down ballot and need to show support all the way from bottom to the top of the ticket.  We plan to hand them out as we canvass. Any idea how to get donated signs. Our Club cannot afford to buy. Thanks.

Content: Hey <@433096446028283905> the text team has been revamping some things so they paused trainings but should be getting back up and running. You might look into other opportunities through the <#1268398483841220649> channel and keep an eye out for when the Vote Team posts that texting is offering new training sessions.

Content: I know that's the risk... I avoid Nextdoor most of the time, so I wasn't even sure if there were places where local orgs can post with tags to attract interested parties. If you find something that works, please come back and share so other areas can leverage the knowledge!

Content: If any of you are interested in CA specific races - I just joined Team Gavin Newsome and though texting is paused for the weekend, looks like there will be texting on the 3rd for some state races. The good thing is they are on discord so if you are already here, you already have an account - it's the same account - you will just have different teams. Watch the videos, take the quiz and if you pass you can join. I understand there is texting every day. I don't know much about what races they engage on, but I see other states as well, not just CA.

Content: I have! I did the BYOB texting but got kicked out of TextFree after a few weeks. I can't use my Google Voice for this but other people have had good luck. I've done three days of the bigger texting efforts and those have been very smooth. I'm signed up for a few of the "text arcades" this month - which I think is really the same as the bigger texting efforts, but you donate to get a list. They do a good job and their Slack is really active

Content: The Overton Window has definitely shifted to the political right.

Part of the challenge facing the media is that by fact checking Trump, it can make it appear as though these organizations are against him from the jump. Which can, in turn, give him further fuel to sow mistrust among his supporters and those who might remain on the fence.

It is a delicate line to walk.

Content: Yes, and, those followers are fully entrenched in their mistrust of any source not part of the Trump propaganda machine, so the efforts to appear "fair" just skew everything right and wind up alienating moderate consumers who then disconnect and wind up getting their information from admittedly left sources like podcasts and websites. It pushes us all into the echochambers. I don't know what the solution is, but the current options aren't it.

If you are in Los Angeles, or have family or friends who want to get involved send them my way. I am meeting with Andre Martin tomorrow for our 1:1 and then hoping my mobilize event link will be approved and I'll drop it here!  Would love to meet some of you IRL

Content: I wrote an article on Medium about how people can help Kamala and Democrats win this November, but it won't do any good unless it gets read!  I don't write a whole lot, so I don't have many followers or anything like that.  I just found all this information and compiled it in a way that I thought people would find inspiring and approachable.  Can I get some help to promote this?  I'm hoping if people read it it will bring in money and volunteers for the campaigns.  https://medium.com/@peterst28/getting-democrats-elected-when-we-fight-we-win-11f92f57af40

Content: I canvassed for down-ballot congressional candidate, Jessica Morse, this morning.  Placer County is very conservative & it feels good to get involved.  

Id like to go to tomorrow‚Äôs Walz event in Reno.  The location and time seem to be under raps, presumably for safety concerns.  Does anyone know when & where it‚Äôll be?

Content: Hi <@196460653932707840> we have so many opportunities that support shy volunteers. It would be a long list to write here, so basically look in Events at the top of the left menu and also look on this page https://events.democrats.org, you would probably be comfortable in anything that other than a phonebank

Content: Hi <@829422877941694564> we need to be careful with links for Marin Dems. Their page has a donate button which is a problem for our alignment with campaign finance law.
You can repost without the link, just describe the org.

Content: Hi <@1278773800326135819> that is so generous of you, of course you can post that here. If you haven't already, you should share in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1242264464246440017 maybe even in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1268426751164551199 but that might draw too big a crowd.

Woodside is an interesting choice. Money is there and Buck's used to be the start-up place to meet. Woodside also used to be home to some pretty blue artists and activists. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Content: Hello, we are interesting in hosting a fundraiser for Harris in San Francisco, and would like to know the easiest way our attendees can donate. A couple of questions:

1. Are funds and donations still needed? We‚Äôve been told that the campaign likely has enough funds now.

2. If a fundraiser will still be helpful, how can we provide a way for people to donate and track the amount that was raised? 

Thank you!

Content: Hello <@715792357488066582> it's great that you want to support the campaign. Funds are probably always welcome, but so are other activities like phone/text banking, postcards, canvassing, etc. 
You can set up your event on https://events.democrats.org/host/ and you can link it to ActBlue so the donations go directly to the campaign. You already have the Host role so you can ask questions and get support in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1245826306780823563

Content: Also note: Woodside is... Well... Rather woody, with many homes tucked away from main roads and I wouldn't be surprised if the residents there have seen an increase in homeowner's insurance since the Paradise fire.

I suspect Trump is hoping that any supporters there will put pressure on Newsome, if he can't raise the money he was expecting.

Content: Thank J. I should clarify that I have lived in the US 20+ years since I came year with my family. It too that long for me to became a citizen because,
1. Green card holders must wait 5 years before becoming citizens
2. My family could not afford to hiring a lawyer or the money to self apply

Content: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! I have promised the sign to someone else but I just reached out to the person from the San Marcos Democratic Club who maintained a local inventory of signs for the 2020 election to see if she has any. I'll let you know as soon as I hear back from her! During 2020, my first yard sign was stolen too, but I've since found that placing it closer to the house/farther up from the street is a good deterrent because people will think twice before walking all of the way up your lawn or driveway to steal it (and all the more so if they can see that there is a Ring camera to catch them!). üôÇ

Content: <@1268699313555509452> Bummer !!  Thanks for checking with the Dem club.  She has a camera but it isn't motion activated so she sees it there and then not 30 minutes later.

Content: Hi Quinn! Good news! The person from the local Dem club can definitely get at least one sign within the next day or two . I asked her to see if she can get me 3 since I'm sure other people I know or others in this channel will also want one as we get closer to the election date. Once I have them I can DM you to coordinate for you or your sister to pick it up üôÇ

Content: Wish we could post media here. There‚Äôs a just-released poll by the Public Policy Institute of CA that shows [**68** percent](https://www.ppic.org/?show-pdf=true&docraptor=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ppic.org%2Fpublication%2Fppic-statewide-survey-californians-and-their-government-september-2024#page8) in favor of codifying Obergefell here, which might be lower than some might expect but very much in line with our history as a moderate electorate when it comes to policy & ballot measures. The GOP has just made itself unviable here.

Content: Hey all -- got an email about a Harris Victory Fund fundraiser with the star of our show, <:kamala1:1269028302203523114> , in San Francisco on Sept. 28. The lowest-price tickets are four-figures. I believe I can post the info here because it's HVF, but will wait till a moderator greenlights. Meantime, happy to DM the link.

Content: Unfortunately unless someone else here signed up for the same event and received confirmation, we wouldn‚Äôt have that info. Did you receive any sort of confirmation email when you signed up? It normally lists the location and contact info for the organizer in there. If not, I‚Äôd recommend going to the original event signup page and looking to see if there is organizer contact info listed on that

Content: Yes! We can get you hooked up over there. You can go to [events.democrats.org and ](https://events.democrats.org/) and select "filters" at the top. Then under the "campaign or organization" field, select "Arizona Democrats - Jumpstart AZ." If you start typing "az" in that field it will pop up. Click on that org, then hit the blue "apply filters" button. It will pull up a list of all of their events---you can also filter by "canvass" under tags, although sometimes that filters out things that shouldn't be filtered out.

Content: Please take some time to decompress, I know these calls can be tough! But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE come back for phone banking. Research has proven that voter contact via phone banking or canvassing is a lot more effective than postcards. We really need you to come back and sign up for another shift! Thanks again for all your hard work üôÇ

Content: It was definitely a tough one today! But normally the ratio of positive to negative call experiences is much better than that, and all of our collective efforts will make a big difference in the end. Thank you much for showing up and doing your part to get Kamala and Tim elected!!!! And thank you for reminding me to do postcards, I need to restock my supply! <:bluewave3:1270555729836900453>

Content: Sharing a report from friends who have been canvassing in a Central Valley swing district (CD 22): it's been different this year - people really want to hear about the differences between R and D. <a:rainbow_heart_scribble:1269029739432120465>  Lots of good conversations and sharing info about Project 2025.  

If you can make it to a swing district, try to canvass this year!

Content: Fun fact: I‚Äôve found that people from other states are often curious when they hear from Californians! I once had someone ask if it‚Äôs true that we roller-skate on the beach, and another person joked that their only exposure to Californians before talking to me was the SNL skit ‚ÄòThe Californians.‚Äô I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôve had the chance to break stereotypes and change minds along the way!

Content: <@1276944250491113656> It was amazing!!!! So much collective, positive energy there! The local NV Dems were out in full force to get out the vote, promote local ballot initiatives, and recruit more volunteers, which was so awesome to see, and there were people dancing and cheering almost the entire time leading up to the speeches! Super kid-friendly too.  And everybody was so nice to each other, even when it came time to exit the parking garage afterwards, lol. They had 3 NV members of congress and both NV US senators speak before VP Harris, and we were able to get close enough to actually see her pretty well without the Jumbotron! It was a crazy long day (didn't get back to SD til 3 am!) but my 12 year old son held up well and said afterwards that he was really glad we were able to be there. I'll post a couple of pics from my phone in a sec.

Content: Hi <@1253583007651074069> for sure downballot candidates are essential to a successful blue wave. And we definitely support you to share phonebank and canvassing opportunities with our vols. Please share the events from [mobilize.us](https://www.mobilize.us/willrollinsforcongress/) or events.democrats.com instead of the candidates webpage which includes a donate button.

Content: Not sure where this belongs but: I attended Camp Kamala and among other things there was some mention of organizing bus trips to Nevada over weekends leading up to the election. I was tentatively interested but felt like I needed to know more (e.g. where I would be staying once there, etc). I tried to indicate that on the sign up sheet. I haven't heard anything back since then. I also haven't tried to get any of the organizers' contact info, so at this point I'm not sure how I'd check back in with them if they still need people. Any advice appreciated (feel free to DM me on Discord)

Content: There are multiple canvassing runs to Reno leaving from the San Francisco Bay Area. See the Swing Left SF or Swing Left Peninsula signup pages here:
https://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/661271/
https://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/636830/

Both of those signup pages appear to cover the same events, but it's two different chapters coordinating. These events are actually feeders into the Nevada Democratic Party, so this is an official Nevada Dems activity.

Content: On this day 4 years ago, a record 3.3 million Americans cast their ballot early.  And as expected, only 1.7 million early votes have been cast (a 45% decrease).  Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/

Content: The Democratic Volunteer Center is an operating team within the Santa Clara County Democratic Party, so its fundraising is part of the Democratic Party.  If the policy here allows you to post links to county Dem parties then it should also allow you to post Democratic Volunteer Center (DVC) links.

Content: Yeah.  It is different.   Threw me for a loop too, even though a lot of other Discord servers I have been on do roles that way.  The good news is... once you are in, you are in.  Let's light up Reddit, and Let's Win This!

Content: Reminder that the path to giving Harris a working House runs through California! 6 races where you can tip the scales:

* CA-47: Min (D) vs Baugh (R). Katie Porter gave up this seat, so no incumbent, and a must-win seat for Democrats. 538 is favoring Min way too highly, the latest poll had Baugh up by 3 points and there has been almost 0 public polling. If you can help in Orange County, this is an important seat to win. 

* CA-45: Tran (D) vs Steel (R, incumbent): it‚Äôs a dead heat. This is one of the best chances to retake the seat after losing it in 2020.

* CA-41: Rollins (D) vs Calvert (R, Incumbent). Calvert remains up in the polls, but within margin of error.

* CA-27: Whitesides (D) vs Garcia (R, Incumbent). Whitesides is narrowly up. One of the best potential flips this cycle now that Christy Smith finally stopped running for (and losing) a very winnable seat.

* CA-22: Salas (D) vs Valadao (R, incumbent): basically a tie. Valadao won by ~3,000 votes in 2022. Can you help close the gap in 2024?

* CA-13: Gray (D) vs Duarte (R, Incumbent). Gray is up in the polls, but within margin of error. Duarte won reelection by 500 votes in 2022: can you help close the gap in 2024?

Content: WIth the caveat that this channel should mostly focus on unity & positive organizing efforts: Smith  isn't a team player and was never able to form a strong campaign apparatus. She lost a Biden+12 (2020) district to Garcia in the 2020 special election, the 2020 general election, and the 2022 general election. Every time she lost, she blamed the Democratic Party for not helping her enough instead of acknowledging that she's just not very popular in her own district and not great at organizing. Policy goals are important, but so is pragmatism -- can't enact major policy if you're not in the House Majority.

Content: Hi <@734924048504717362> - No, generally they do not publicize the schedule for security reasons.  This is the best channel to ask about local or state wide events.  Just curious, do you have time to do some phone banking? We have many flexible options. Also, online engagement is a great option too.

Content: I wanted to go to the HQ tomorrow with my mom to get oriented and inspired.  Then I can continue from home. Text banking is probably preferable for me. Or confirmation calls.

Content: There is a bigger problem with mobilize this afternoon that is blocking people from entering the zoom meetings. I would be patient and sign up again if you can't get in. The IT people are working on it. (Also in general, the text team trainings sometimes start late, and they won't admit you if you are late - so if you get in line, stay in line.)

Content: Ok I think the SF office is run by the San Francisco Democratic Party, so the dynamic is a little different. Not just focused on Harris/Walz. 901 Market St @ Fifth St. Office is open 11-7 weekdays and 11-5 on the weekends.

Content: **Hey Los Angeles!**

Last weekend, I went on a bus trip over to **Yuma, Arizona** with a bunch of Obama alums to knock on doors and talk to voters for Kamala, Tim, and Ruben Gallego, who's in a neck and neck senate race against Kari Lake over in Arizona.

I'd thought to myself, "what in the world are 15 volunteers going to do?" Turns out we tripled the size of their office for a weekend and doubled their canvassing power. They were very, very happy to see us.

We had a woman who'd recently had an organ transplant hoofin' it in 103 degree heat because she wanted to make damn well sure that Arizona goes blue this year.

Well, **I'm going back.** I want a full bus this time, and so I'm asking my fellow Angelenos to **join me** on this trip. I'm going to drop the link for our trip right here:

https://events.democrats.org/event/724339/

We have a bus, we have lodging, we have sandwiches: **all we need are boots on the ground to rally our supporters!** Arizona's already started voting, so let's get moving!

If you have quick questions, give me a ping over Discord.

Best,

Anna Kim

Content: I'm sorry - I do not have any info - on the RSVP form it shows window of 12pm - 9pm PDT - I reached out to the organizer via email once I got a confirmation (you will have an option to contact organizer) as I plan to drive which is going to be 8-9 hours for me... Have you RSVP'd yet? You should do so regardless if you can attend or not - you can always cancel later if you do not attend. I know from experience they really keep the time slot sort of open ended and do not announce location until day before.

Content: Hey Los Angeles!

Last week, I and a dozen other volunteers went down to Yuma, Arizona, to knock on doors and canvass for Kamala and Tim. Many of us weren't sure we'd be going. The logistics were shaky, we weren't sure what the situation would look like on the ground, we had weekend plans...

...and we tossed all caution to the wind and rode off to Arizona in support of this campaign! The Yuma office was ecstatic to get our support, and are looking forward to our return this upcoming weekend.

We have a bus, we have accommodations, we have sandwiches, all we need now are more boots on the ground! Will you join us?

The sign up for this Los Angeles to Yuma trip is located here:
https://events.democrats.org/event/724339/

We leave tomorrow, so sign up quick. I look forward to meeting those who can answer the call!

Best,

Anna K

Content: Hey folks! My wife (good planner) and I (good at tech) are in Santa Barbara and are considering organizing an Oct26 carpool/bus from SB to Las Vegas to knock on doors. E.g. https://events.democrats.org/c/surge_carpools-for-kamala-to-nv/event/create/  The closest buses leave from LA, and we think there's a busload from SB that we might be able to organize. Who can I DM or talk to about how this works? We have a lot of questions, like: Who pays? Who do I talk to in Vegas? Do I call bus companies to charter a bus? What if we don't get enough people? Etc.

Content: I've worn this on the Pickleball courts in Long Beach twice now. Technically, it's not really a partisan shirt, but in today's political climate, it basically is. Most players have kept quiet about the shirt (Pickleball is usually a politics free zone), but I've had 3 positive comments and 1 negative. The negative later apologized. She said she is very fearful of what might happen in the election. I said I'm fearful in the other direction. Later, I wished I had said "terrified" ‚Äî which would be more accurate.

We don't have time to wait to decide; we can always cancel/redirect if there's already a bus from SB, or we can't make it work, etc. If you know anyone organizing in SB, send them our way!

Content: Posting this here and possible elsewhere. Yesterday I attended the What's at Stake with Project 2025 and how to talk to voters about it. AWESOME use of my time.  He wraps P2025 in a clear package ....simplifies it an highlights the 4 most impressive issues that voters will care about and how to listen to voters and guide them with a few words to see the harm. VERY simply put. I did screenshot the slide deck bc it was so useful PERFECT info to arm you with in calls and conversations with voters. I HIGHLY recommend attending.

Content: Do we have people here who have traveled to Reno to join the canvassing efforts? I'm considering going there for Nov. 1-5 to canvas every day but I'd like to know if the Reno operation has their act together. I wouldn't want to go all the way to Reno only discover that the Dem team there isn't sufficiently organized.
