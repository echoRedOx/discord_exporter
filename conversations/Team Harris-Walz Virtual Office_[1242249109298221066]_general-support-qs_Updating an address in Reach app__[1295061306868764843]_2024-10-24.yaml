  content: "I have a voter in Reach who recently moved and is in a totally different\

    t sure. Reach app still has old address & voting info. Can I update it somehow\
    \ to get their current voting precincts etc? They\u2019re a strong Harris supporter,\
    \ but an infrequent voter. Trying to encourage them to get out and vote. Thanks!"

  content: FYI - I am looking here, which you may have done already. https://democrats.org/reach/vr/
    but the actual steps are in the Reach Online Knowledge Base. https://www.reach.vote/knowledge-base/contact-actions/.  Yes,
    it says you can edit.

    gently poking them to go vote this year. They're a good friend, so I can use compassionate
    peer pressure on them lol. Thanks for all you're doing to help the campaign as
    well!

  content: Thanks for looking into this for me. Bummer. I'll have to hunt down their
    voting precinct information by hand then. I'm pretty sure that if I tell them
    where to go and when it's open, they'll go out and vote when they otherwise wouldn't.
    Thank you so much for taking time to hunt down info for me!
