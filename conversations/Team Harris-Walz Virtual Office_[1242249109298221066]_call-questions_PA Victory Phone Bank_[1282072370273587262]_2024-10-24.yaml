  content: I am trying to get into the Phone Bank going on now, but Mobilize keeps
    sending me only the link to send to invite friends. Could somebody send the Zoom
    link for the phone bank, please?  I know I probably confused the system because
    I had to cancel to go see my mother in the hospital in AK, but then the trip was
    cancelled, so I am trying to rejoin.
