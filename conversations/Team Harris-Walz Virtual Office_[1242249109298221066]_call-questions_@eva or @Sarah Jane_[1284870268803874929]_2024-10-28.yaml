  content: This is Amy Berk. I saw a blank for today for a co-facilitator, 9/15, 4-6p.
    I completed my shadow shift yesterday. I will sign up for the shift so I can get
    the link. Will someone let  me in when I arrive early?

    link? This is my first time co-facilitating. Thanks.  I'll also look in the facilitator
    channel. (I am new to Discord, too!)

    \ your name to facilitator and use the facilitator background.  Log in 20 minutes\
    \ early.  At 15 minutes early, the host will log on and admit you.  Move yourself\
    \ to the VOTE team room (sometimes called the debrief room or preparation room\u2026\
    not practice room)."

    I will be there at 20 minutes to the hour (4 ET/3CT). Very excited! Thanks!

    training slide deck. It says the updated deck for the day/session will be sent
    by email. I'll be fine without the newest deck, since the training deck doesn't
    change. But would love to see it if available, Thanks

  content: sorry to jump in, I'm reading things here as I prepare to also jump into
    being a MOD soon. I also have mirroring on so because it's disconcerting to have
    it off. So my background looks backwards to me but forward to everyone else who
    sees me not mirrored! I just checked with the other Captains to make sure the
    first time I used it.
