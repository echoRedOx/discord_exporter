  content: 'Hi all - while we''re waiting on texting campaigns to wrap up more I would
    love to stay involved and keep helping out. I am interested in working with the
    Mobile Inbox team for Digital Correspondence, but it looks like I may have missed
    the last training.


    Are there any recordings of these trainings, or an intent to do more in the future?
    I would really like to join that team as well and would feel bad if I missed out
    on the last chance, especially with the DNC coming up and a likely spike in engagement.


    Thank you!'

  content: They'll probably have some stuff after the convention. Don't quote me on
    that because I don't really know for certain but I do know from doing this for
    8 years that it's always after conventions that they really start amping up the
    number of volunteers on numerous levels. So keep an eye out for that we do put
    links to all the different trainings in the events section on the sidebar in the
    server so always look there to see what kind of trainings we have going on

  content: "Is there a good place to go that can offer suggestions for what to say\
    \ to friends and family members when they report misinformation as if it were\
    \ absolute fact and accuse me of being the one who is no fact checking? For example\
    \ my oldest sister constantly says \u201CKamala is such a liar!\u201D I\u2019\
    ve tried to ask her what lies she\u2019s supposedly told (sister pivots). When\
    \ I suggest fact checking sites, I don\u2019t think she checks them because she\
    \ believes conspiracies - like Hilary\u2019s Pizza thing. Ridiculous. I\u2019\
    m wondering if anyone has found a way to say something to close-minded Fox & Friends\
    \ that will get them to open their minds?"
