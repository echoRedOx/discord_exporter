But it seems I made two Discord accounts. I thought I deleted one but it's still showing up. Is there any way to know that I deleted it correctly, and how to be properly onboarded on this accout which is the right one? The one that was created a few years ago is the correct one, and the one that was created today was by mistake."

I have some time later today to dig into this on zoom and get your number re-assigned to the correct account. If you don't have time today, and you can't wait 14 days for Discord to delete, there is one other work-around of using a family member's phone to verify today and then replacing it with your phone when the other account is deleted."
