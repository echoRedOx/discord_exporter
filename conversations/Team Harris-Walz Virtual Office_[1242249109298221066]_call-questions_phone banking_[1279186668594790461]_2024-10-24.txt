Content: He thinks callers could add something to this effect after introducing themselves, that as a Democratic supporter the caller respects the receiver's opinions and his right to vote the way he chooses, and the caller will respects the results of the elections.

Content: That's good, you can use that if it works for you, we've had lots of feedback from people on approaches that work for them.  Whatever allows you to connect & get into a conversation you can use.

Content: You should try to follow the script closely,  You are welcome to make changes that make speaking to voters more comfortable for you.  Many volunteers change how they introduce themselves so that it works better for them.

Content: Thank you! I'm going to write that to refer to while I'm on a call. One of the things that kept me from volunteering in the past was fear that I'm not knowledgeable enough on the issues, vote history, etc. to answer questions or counter objections. I am sighed up to do this anyway because it's important, so I am setting fear aside. (First shift today.) This helps having a canned sentence ready so I won't panic, lol!)

Content: The first and only time i did phone banking ( 2 weeks ago) the script told me to lead off the call by asking if its is who we think it is, ie ask the person "Hello, is this John?" or whatever their name is. I've been taught never to confirm my name on a cold call and most people hung up on me the minute I asked. It seems to waste a lot of time and effort to lead off with this question.   I think you should change the script to eliminate that question and go straight to "Hi this is..., I'm a volunteer calling about..." Also, the options to click on once you actually talk to a person aren't that clear cut. For example if they confirm its"john and then hang up, do I click "this isthe right person" or do I click "hung up." I'll be doing phone banking again tomorrow and I'm kind of dreading this, FD

Content: I'm sorry you didn't have a good experience with your first phone bank.  The script does not have to be followed verbatim but we do want to get the bolded questions answered. You can change it around so it works for you.  We do want to confirm who we are talking to and mark the appropriate box.  If they hang up, then click the hang up button.  The scripts and reason for the calls change, so the script you saw may not be the same script next time. Thanks so much for joining our phone bank and hope you'll keep giving it a try!
