But otherwise you cannot track donations. I find that the easiest thing to do is just give people the Act Blue links for the Harris/Walz campaign and then ask them to take a screen shot of the receipt and send it to you as the organizer so you can see the success of the event.

The organizers in NH do a great job pairing up people who are new to Door knocking or phone banking with proper training and - in the case of door knocking - having a buddy. I love door knocking it gets me out into the communities and learning about what matters to voters. My advice is if you are going to door knock, find a location that works for you and go there regularly. You get to build a relationshiop with the organizers and get to know the town/city, and build a sense of comfort. 

These are the Volunteer links I have gotten from the MA State Organizer, but you can also go to go.kamalaharris.com and plug in your zip code for priority events:

- We are still in voter identity time. This means we are looking for people have been voters in the past and who were unaffiliated, or who have voted Democrat in the past, but may not be diehard Dems. This is very common in NH. 
- There were a lot of voters who were undecided. Speaking to voters is very important. Marile was great at talking about Project 2025, I pushed that VP Harris was in New Hampshire last week speaking about her Economic Plan and the local news have done a great deal of coverage of the event. (Thankfully, NH has a lot of very active local newspapers). 
- Yes, there were some Tr-mp supporters (mostly men) who answered the door and wouldn't give the wives space to speak. There were also men who just didn't answer the door, despite us seeing them inside. Yes, I would rather speak to the obnoxious Tr-mp voter who literally shouted at us. At least he told me who he was. He didn't intimidate me, and frankly, he looked very small next to his big truck. 
- Favorite homes? The small family farmer whose 4 people in the household would be supporting Kamala Harris ... I picked up some local honey from her farm stand. And the woman who had just come home from a vacation in the Poconos and was thrilled to see me with my Kamala Harris and NH Democrats literature. ""Thank goodness you are here!"" 
- It felt great to walk and knock. We need more door knockers. We are going to be finishing Voter ID time and moving into persuasion time soon. And we need YOU to knock knock knock."

If you need the link, lmk and I can DM it to you. 
I will also say that the phone bank sessions into swing states are the most challenging, but also the most essential. Each time you have an angry MAGA supporter on the end of the line, remind yourself that you are culling them from our calls lists now so that, come November, when we are vigilantly calling all Harris supporters and undecided voters to GOTV, we are an efficient, well-oiled machine that will drive us to victory on election night. You are pulling the weeds for our beautiful future garden. 

If that doesn't work, I suggest taking a 10 minute break to watch YouTube videos of baby goats wearing pajamas.
