This is NOT the Victory 2024 Text Team. Please ask a community moderator for help on finding your channel. Please DO NOT spam the Mobile Inbox Team channel. 

Here is where you'll assign yourself roles based on the training sessions you've attended:

Please choose the envelope emoji if you've completed the Email Team Training. 
Please choose the text bubble emoji if you've completed the Mobile Inbox Training. 

You will then be assigned the corresponding role (ie: Mobile Inbox Team) and be added to the appropriate channels. If this doesn't work and you don't receive a role or get added to a channel, let a moderator know and they can help you. 

If you have not completed any Digital Correspondence trainings, please do not enter the email or mobile inbox team channels. If you need help navigating Discord, please reach out to a community moderator."
