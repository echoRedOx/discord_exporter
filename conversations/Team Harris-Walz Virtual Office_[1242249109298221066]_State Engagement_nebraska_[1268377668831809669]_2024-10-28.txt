Content: Ok false alarm‚Ä¶ they aren‚Äôt coming to NE. However, they should. The state government is flouting the legislation passed about restored voting rights for folks with felony convictions. The Secretary of State, AG, and Governor won‚Äôt honor the law, and purged all the names of people with convictions, unless they have the ok from ‚Äî-the same three officials who are boasting about ignoring the will of the people and violating voting rights! It‚Äôs literally the.  same.   guys. 

I realize we‚Äôre only one electoral vote, but it was key to winning for both Biden and Obama. We want a Kamalaha win, but gah! We are a small crew! I keep hoping we get some interest. üò¨

I can‚Äôt afford as much time as I‚Äôd like to, so I been hopefully offsetting that a bit by making weekly donations to Harris campaign, to DNC and to Hope Springs From Field, which is a third party organization that does deep canvassing in swingy areas.

Content: FYI <#1268377668831809669> The election is mere weeks away, and vast amounts of pressure is now on Nebraska lawmakers to change the game‚Äôs rules before it even begins. So let‚Äôs call this exactly what it is: a brazen attempt at a power grab by special interests, outsiders, and politicians who want to get their way at all costs ‚Äì even if it means removing a powerful Nebraska legacy. 

Remember: How Nebraska awards its electoral votes sets our state apart and unites us. While most other states give all their electoral college votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state, in Nebraska, we can allocate our votes by congressional district. This is a Nebraska tradition because of our deeply nonpartisan heritage that promotes fair representation and boosts participation on Election Day.

Nebraska‚Äôs split electoral vote system has worked for over 30 years, ensuring fair representation for all voters. Returning to a winner-take-all approach would ignore Nebraska‚Äôs diverse voices and political landscape. Our current system ensures that urban and rural areas are represented fairly, fosters greater voter engagement, and prevents any one party from monopolizing our state‚Äôs electoral votes. This system has given Nebraska unique influence on the national stage, and there‚Äôs no valid reason to abandon a method that empowers all voters and preserves fairness.

Content: Nebraska friends, especially those who live in the second congressional district.  PLEASE call your governor and your state senator and tell them to OPPOSE the push by Trump and MAGA Republicans to steal an electoral college vote.  This essential electoral college vote could hypothetically win us The White House, or throw the whole country into chaos.  Which is exactly what they want.  And as a bonus, you also have an abortion measure.  Please use the link below to see all the upcoming deadlines and important information!  https://www.vote411.org/

Content: Yes, NE GOP shenanigans are at a fever pitch. The story is being covered nationally, on Democracy Docket and Axios, so far. Not how you want to make national news, my cornhusking friends! 

For some really good mileage on your call to representatives, I would suggest Sen. McDonnell. As of last night, he was still a no. He used to be a Democrat and switched after being censured for his support for abortion bans and intolerance of trans people. BUT he really wants to be mayor of Omaha. Deatbeat Mayor Stothert came out yesterday and said she‚Äôs in support of winner-take-all, again striking a contrast with McDonnell.

McDonnell has a strong union history, and voting to take away Omaha‚Äôs voice in national elections won‚Äôt go over well. 
Official line to call: (402) 471-2710
Email him your thoughts: mmcdonnell@leg.ne.gov

Content: Last but not least: come do the voter protection hotline training with me! I was the only NE volunteer when I did training. When mail in ballots are rejected (looking at you, Evnen!) volunteers contact those voters and help them cure their ballots and get their votes counted.

Content: I hope he wins, because his opponent has shown over and over she will choose party over country, and profit over people. She‚Äôs lining her pockets and phoning it in for the people she represents.

I think it‚Äôs hard to say what Osborn‚Äôs chances are, because he‚Äôs a different kind of candidate. He had a town hall here this week, and is doing many more. His opponent isn‚Äôt even bothering to campaign or debate. So he‚Äôs doing the leg work. 

He needs to come back to the university and connect with young voters. It‚Äôs a big group in the district and more likely to be open to voting outside the letter next to the name.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!

Content: Hey folks! Thank you for joining us. **Together, we will write the next chapter in the greatest story ever told.**

Phonebanking is our **number one priority** so close to the election, and it‚Äôs a phenomenal way to get started. We often set goals for specific numbers, like how we set a goal for 5 million calls this past weekend. We made 4.6 million, reaching immense numbers of people!

We‚Äôre 300,000 calls behind our goal for the day, and we urgently need to call Wisconsin voters. Early voting starts today in Wisconsin, and people need voting plans! We‚Äôre only **14 days away** from the election!

[Can we count on you to help us? Please, click here to get started and call directly into Wisconsin!](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=32641249-daa7-4253-b97b-df11f362bdb3&ref=go_kh_calls_wi&utm_source=hfp_w_go_calls_20241022&utm_campaign=hfp_w_go_mb_do_vol_vrec_calls_20241022&utm_medium=go_kh_calls_20241022&utm_term=go_kh_calls_20241022)

We know it‚Äôs scary for many of you. I have the same anxiety as well. But a second trump administration is much scarier. We can do this!
