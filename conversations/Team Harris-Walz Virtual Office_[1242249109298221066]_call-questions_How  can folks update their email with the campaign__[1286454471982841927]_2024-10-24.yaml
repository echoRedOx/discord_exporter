    her email that she have the campaign:


    "Waiting on the debrief now and wanted to doublecheck with a Mod: I spoke to woman
    planning to attend that may have given a misspelled email address her sign-up
    form. Is there any way to pass along her corrected info so she can receive her
    RSVP email?''


    I told him she could sign up again with the correct email, but I''m sure there
