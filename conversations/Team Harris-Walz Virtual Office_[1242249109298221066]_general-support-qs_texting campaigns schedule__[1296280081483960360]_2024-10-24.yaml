  content: when I did texting in 2020 I seemed to be busy all the time and sent thousands
    of texts. This time I rarely see the announcements in time to get into a campaign.
    this might be obvious, but any hints on how to know when to check, or where something
    like a schedule is posted? Thnak you!

    JUMP. good problem to have right?
