Breitbart admits that this was in the very early days of the pandemic when the hysteria was at its height  (March 2020).  The Minnesota Reformer, wrote: Walz has said that while his executive order grants him powers to fine or jail people who violate the stay-home order, his administration is telling police departments to warn people rather than issue citations. Violations carry penalties of up to a $1,000 fine or 90 days in jail.

The city of Edina cited such complaints when it decided to further restrict use of public spaces because residents were not adhering to social-distancing guidelines.

This was in the VERY FIRST weeks of the pandemic.  So yes, there was a hotline, but I haven't seen any reports about arrests or what happened."
