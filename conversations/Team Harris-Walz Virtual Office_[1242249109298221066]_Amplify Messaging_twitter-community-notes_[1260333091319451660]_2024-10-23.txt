Content: I wish this was around in 2016. It seems like Biden is facing so much unfair scrutiny like Hilary did in 2016. Trump also had scrutiny but it didn’t matter to his voters. I know everyone is working so hard here to prevent another 2016. I am so thankful for everyone.

Content: Hi everyone, I know there was some big news today, but its still very important to stay on top of fighting misinformation. There will be a lot of attention and attacks on VP Harris now, so make sure to be adding community notes to any misinformation you see! And of course post it in the chat so we can all vote!

Content: <@553416114823233537> I think I am now able to rate community notes on X. (It has been 3 months since I signed up for it. ) Do you know if I can I expect to get more information from X on how it works?  Anyway, I will start rating things as helpful or unhelpful as requested in this channel.

Content: <@553416114823233537> Biden never named Kamala to border czar? Why do you think that’s accurate? She was put in place to speak to the countries that have the majority of immigrants coming here to cross our border. She wasn’t in charge of all immigration laws/policies. Czar implies in charge of all parts of immigration. If you read the last cited article it talks about her being in charge of diplomacy in regards to trying to find ways to support the people in the countries find another alternative to making such a treacherous trip. The articles and the post were opinion pieces to slam Kamala. That’s why I found it unhelpful.

Content: In short, Vance called for taxing childless people more than people with children. The Harris campaign said that was, well, ludicrous, only for the Trump campaign to say “haha got you we were talking about cutting taxes for parents through the Child Tax Credit”.

Which 1. Is not what Vance said. And 2. Biden/Harris pushed for the Child Tax Credit to be extended, but not enough Republicans supported

Content: A suggestion: at present, the HarrisHQ Twitter profile presence is 'KAMALA HQ' with KAMALA in small letters & HQ in big letters & the whole thing at a slight angle; the cover photo is really poor with just 'kamala hq' in lower case on a green background.  That cover photo really needs to be better.

Content: The cover photo for the twitter I feel is a great idea. It panders to the Gen Z audience. As the bright green back drop and black text is supposed to replicate the album cover to Charli XCXs new album “brat”. It has actually made kamala very popular on TikTok.

Content: I do understand that, however making more parts of her campaign centered towards the younger crowd is a good idea. Many are just turning 18 and are able to vote or some were not able to vote in the 2020 election but can in the 2024 election. It’s a huge amount of voters that can be steered into voting for kamala.

Content: I understand, but since it's the official Twitter HQ account, I feel it should have a general appeal-- it almost looks like a fake account as it is now.  Looks a bit cheesy also.  (I'm a graphics person.  👸  )  Just my opinion.

Content: Thanks for raising the possibility that Elon might "manipulate" community notes. His posts go to tens of millions so have been a priority for me to post or help CN's. But I do wonder if he would allow a CN to eventually be allowed next to his post. Or could it push him to delete the post??? Hope we are not wasting our time.

Content: For some good news - Independent research shows that CN's tend to use moderate to high quality sources AND posts with CN's are much less likely to be reposted: "Studies show community notes have helped to counteract disinformation and misinformation, particularly around COVID-19 and vaccines. Reviewing over 65,000 notes on COVID-19, nearly half of them cited high-authority sources and 44% cited moderately trustworthy sources. 
While X/Twitter says that community notes are not effective at dispelling all instances of misinformation, it has shown a positive impact in these ways:
X users repost content 61% less often once it receives a community note.
Original posters delete their content faster once they receive a community note.
Users perceive community notes as significantly more trustworthy compared to other misinformation flags.
However, it’s worth mentioning that community notes are a lagging indicator. These notes apply to posts that have already been seen by the public. If posts contain misinformation or disinformation, some damage has already been done by the time the post receives a community note." https://www.meltwater.com/en/blog/twitter-community-notes

Content: 💡 Sorry if this has already been covered but has anyone considered pulling transcripts of videos like these and running through ChstGPT and Claude.ai and asking the AI to cite sources?  

(Then doing a human check afterwards just to double check?)

Should speed the entire process up.

Content: My attempt today to combat what I perceive to be the rapidly spreading misinformation regarding the Biden-Harris Administration and a common correlation I often see among my personal community and on social media between them and fluctuation of prices.
-

In this case, I’m commenting on what can technically be interpreted as a true/valid statement by a Republican House Representative concerning gas prices, yet for someone who represents a portion of the Legislative Branch of the United States Government, seems to make an oddly misleading statement from my perspective.

Content: Good morning folks -- Kamala has picked Tim Walz of MN as her VP pick. There are many posts bashing his record at https://x.com/RNCResearch  Here is one post  with a CN that needs help https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1820631464645443700  One post attacks Walz for creating a "sanctuary state" . I did a review of research and found:   “Sanctuary communities” are as safe as other communities. They are likely to decrease crime because immigrant victims, including domestic abuse victims, are much more willing to call the police.    Here is one of the studies:  https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1078087417704974

Content: I'm a beginner here, if I click on a post and I don't see the CN how do I view them? I just joined community notes and I'm waiting to be fully set up or whatever, maybe thats why. It seems like the Magas are big mad that we are using the notes to share facts. oh well.

Content: like the people using the notes to tell other people that they should be using comments and not notes. MAGA logic. WEIRD.

Content: There are way goo many on the right who are using CN for their opinions, not to add context or clarity or facts. That's what CN are supposed to be for. So yes, there are a lot of "this belongs in the comments, not in CN" and "stop abusing CN."

Those stupid comments in CN should always be down voted. When it reaches the threshold of "not helpful" you'll get credit for it. Down voting is as important as up voting.

Content: If you click on the dots in the top right post of an ad on Twitter, you can choose “not interested in this ad” and it will disappear from your stream. Eventually you might train the algorithm to stop giving them to you.
It is clear that trumps team has invested heavily in Twitter ads spewing hate and lies, but currently they all say “ad” in the top right corner. 
There is no need to repost or comment on that garbage and it might help to point out in different ways that this is a thing. 🙏🏼

Content: The reason mocking the right is working is because they respond. I dont think interacting with obvious nonsense is productive because it gives it traction in the "algorithm"  which only sees that there is activity and does not care about the content.

Post about positivity, issues, and mock the right.

Content: I think there's an important feature of CN that contributors ignore far too often: the ability to down-vote bs CN. Down-voting those CN not only shuts down the bs one, it also adds to your CN contributor score when the status of the bs reaches "not helpful."

Content: Unfortunately, the people we need to reach would not be seeking out the truth on such a platform.  So it's a case of preaching to the choir.  

It could aid only in giving us a resource in which to mine to desseminate truth to a wider audience.  But the grind will persist for as long as power hungry megalomaniacs remain in charge of platforms like twitter, for whom the actual truth threatens their hegemony.  

This is nothing new, just newspaper Moguls and industrialists of old who once ran the world and then... Suddenly .. did not 😉

Content: Thank you Dan, this is helpful.  The attack ads are pretty brutal and full of lies, and at least one family member who doesn't inform herself, might find some of these articles enlighten, that is -- if she will take the time to read them. What I liked about Obama's Fight the Smears site, was that it had the LIE, followed by a succinct explanation of the TRUTH.

Content: Thanks, Tim! This is great. My latest list of fact-checking articles is attached. Have not yet compared with yours. I am thinking of putting mine on Google Docs for easy updating. An earlier version was posted a couple of days ago An advantage of mine is that links are very short, using bitly. I suggest folks regularly check Kessler at Wash. Post, Factcheck.org, Politifact.com, and Snopes.com. I look for falsehoods on Twitter sites with a broad reach -- MAGA War Room, RNC Research, Heritage Foundation, and, of course, Elon, Am interested in hearing about other's strategies.

Content: Sorry, new here! I signed up to do community notes but I know that can take a while. What can I do now? Just say notes are helpful? I follow the links but there are sometimes multiple notes... How do I know which is the one someone here did? Sorry! I'm very green with all this. Need reading thru stuff today but still just not sure. BUT, I'm medically disabled and unable to work... Meaning I got a lot of  free time! Happy to help! (My name is Kristy btw, on Twitter I'm KristySLP)

Content: Hi Folks - Elon Musk will be interviewing Donald Trump tomorrow evening [Monday} at 8 ET/5 PT on X-Twitter. I will look in real-time for video clips on Elon's account, RNC Research, MAGA War Room & others. For responding, I am preparing or recycling community notes in areas where Musk & Trump align in bashing: trans rights, DEI, immigrants, mainstream media, etc. I will post draft community notes in a document here before the interview. I can only post one CN a day so you are welcome to borrow some of mine if you want to join in this effort. I'll focus on responses to immigration falsehoods.  Elon has 190 million followers so this could be bigger than most TV events.

Content: Regarding the crowd size falsehoods about the Detroit rally, I suggest linking to reliable media that includes video e.g., https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/11/politics/trump-harris-crowd-size-conspiracy-theory/index.html  Our own or others photos can be easily dismissed as fakes. We can message around how easily Trump buys into conspiracy theories that fit his narrative. I saw one message saying this shows he's delusional & should never have the nuclear codes

Content: ALERT - At 3 AM Trump posted on Twitter https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1822889460243001547?t=qlUJIbn9f1if149w-Gaoaw&s=03 It has now been seen by 12 million. The community notes need help & we can use some better ones with citations. In the 'responses", you will see a battle between pro and anti-Trump responders. I have been liking and reposting the anti-Trump ones. - Dan

Content: Italian American group is claiming Tim Walz has racism towards them because of a statue and are asking him to step down as Kamas VP. If this were true of him, would he have signed into law a recognition of Italian– American heritage month in the state of Minnesota?  Please see his proclamation! This is a right by wing attack and not the belief of this Italian American! Don’t let them paint him a racist!!

Eric Hovde--If voters can't trust you to tell the truth in your campaign, we won't be able to trust you in office. It seems like you don't want us to hear what Tammy is saying as you covered up her speech with ducks quacking.  That is silly & honestly just dumb.

Content: Hi  - Thanks for bringing up the Musk-Trump conversation. I am resending below my message on this topic. I am attaching information on several areas they might talk about and post: DEI, anti-Trans etc. Some statements are already in CN form. Please message everyone if you use any, so we don't duplicate. I will be focusing on various aspects of immigration, which are not in the attached document. I doubt CNs can work on lifestream and we'll need to look for posting within minutes of a statement. I heard Trump was not actually back on X --- Dan             Hi Folks - Elon Musk will be interviewing Donald Trump tomorrow evening [Monday} at 8 ET/5 PT on X-Twitter. I will look in real-time for video clips on Elon's account, RNC Research, MAGA War Room & others. For responding, I am preparing or recycling community notes in areas where Musk & Trump align in bashing: trans rights, DEI, immigrants, mainstream media, etc. I will post draft community notes in a document here before the interview. I can only post one CN a day so you are welcome to borrow some of mine if you want to join in this effort. I'll focus on responses to immigration falsehoods.  Elon has 190 million followers so this could be bigger than most TV events.

There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on 𝕏. Working on shutting it down. 

Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later.

Content: Hi Kate -  Thanks for the reminder. If you are talking about my messages, please see my 6:09 message. We are working on community notes for possibly the biggest misinformation event in years. Musk and Trump are in conversation now with 40 million listening. I am inviting others to join me in scanning right-wing sites for posting from the event and then commenting, posting community notes, and rating community notes. I prepared community notes and other info and shared with this group in advance. Community notes and ratings are most effective when posted soon after an original post that goes to sites with large followings. Musk has 190 million followers. So that's what we are about. take care, Dan

Content: <@1270180986063163454>  so in brief, sometimes we'll post something here and if there's enough votes, everyone can see it, but if there's not enough votes yet, it can be voted on by the CN contributors here

Content: Wow -- The Trump-Musk conversation just ended. Trump just got a huge lift from Musk in his words and the platform. Please look for posts for commenting,  & needing community notes written or rated.  I am making responses at https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom and https://x.com/RNCResearch I can only post one community note a day and will do one on myths about immigration and crime. - Dan

Content: I have good news and bad news. Bad news is that the Trump-Musk conversation last night was heard by millions & [no surprise] they spewed many falsehoods. And, oh yes, Trump has 90 M followers & Musk has 190 M. Good news - here is a terrific fact-checking article on their conversation, I will use all or parts of it today to make responses & community notes. I can do only 1 CN a day so I may ask for your help posting some https://cnn.it/3AkDFIm

Content: Ok, just trying to figure out how it’s working… new to discord- left the platform formally known as twitter… (try not to freely advertise the name 😆) when musket started his takeover but kept my accounts & have over 4k followers so want to re-engage with them but there have been changes I’m trying to work through.  

On the call last night he literally said he was going to build an iron dome over the U.S. for nuclear protection.  So I guess no need for a border wall, we will have an iron dome now. 
 
Do you know if anyone started a meme on that?

Content: I also can’t add notes as I never post… and apparently need some rating or ranking before I can. I’ll work on that !

Content: Thanks for sharing this article, Samantha. I've seen many negative stories & I liked some of the info in this article. Yesterday the issue was raised in another channel. I sent a staff person the following message [only a part is shown]. I hope some talking points can be developed " I did a search. MANY right-wing outlets reported on the supposed ties 3 days ago, e.g. Fox News https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-walz-ties-muslim-cleric-antisemitic-views-gave-state-funding-group-report Does not look like the ties are very direct. One time the cleric helped Walz calm protesters. Walz supported the Muslim community in many ways https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2024/08/06/five-faith-facts-tim-walz-lutheran-248512 Perhaps someone can create a message about the true nature of the ties -- Walz did not support any anti-Semitic views."

Content: I've applied to join community notes and that's pending, but when I click on links like the batch posted above I'm *not* even shown a community note to rate. Am I missing a step in the interface? (I mean clicking on the ones where folks ask "please rate as...", it just takes me to a tweet with no notes interface on it)

Content: I don't blame you for leaving. The whole place has deteriorated steadily since Melon bought it. I stay there because of the way the platorm works itself - there's just no better place for aggregated current events, even without being bombarded by ads, if one knows how to use it...and while it still has this functionality. It's also still really good at mute/block like no other platform.

Content: I thought I was not going to engage with anything with him on it.  I don’t want to give him the attention that he craves. X is a perfect place to post the less positive stuff. Stuff to try to educate his voters. I too had jumped off when it was purchased by melon. But we have to use all tools available to get all the votes possible.

Content: Hi Holly & anyone new to twitter-community-notes. Great question. I am not a staff or a moderator, but I will share my process. I have done community notes for about 2 months & on this channel for about 3 weeks.  As HorribleRyan [I bet you're not so horrible] said, we scroll through this channel for requests to help with a tweet. In addition, I scan for posts on X-twitter with community notes that can be rated or where I can add a comm. note. I focus on very recent posts on right-wing sites like RNC Research, MAGA War Room, Heritage Foundation, End Wokeness, and others.  I also look at the new notes in the Community Notes section https://x.com/i/communitynotes/new . I use fact-checking sites & articles. Attached is my latest list.

Content: Thanks Dan! I'm not very "online" as they say...I don't really tweet and I have to admit, I'm also not super knowledgable about the fact checking sites. But if I see anyone on this channel point out any tweets that need ratings, I will try my best to help I guess.

Content: If you have ideas about what the campaign should focus on, I'm pretty sure there are other channels for that. For those of us who feel using community notes on twitter is worthwhile, it's harder to do that when there's off-topic posts to scroll through 🤷🏼‍♀️

I found a fairly nuanced report on here DA role in general https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/363859/kamala-harris-prosecutor-record-tough-crime and one specific to priest sex abuse cases https://www.ncregister.com/news/kamala-harris-district-attorney-documents-on-sex-abuse Ideally we'll find quotes from some victims who felt supported

Content: I’ll be honest, it is infuriating that people assume if an AG/DA does not respond to an email, inquiry, etc that there must be something nefarious going on. These folks have secretaries and staffers who filter through communications (and flag anything and report it if it’s harmful) and only give them pertinent comms. I say this only because my day job is a public defender so I know just *tiny bit* about how a DA office operates. Due to the lack of citizen knowledge on judicial processes, ethics, and laws—it makes our jobs extremely difficult and we get labeled as liars or trying to “hide the truth.” 

Specifically, the priest who claims he was abused as a child by another priest was seeking to obtain records held by her DA office, in order to release the names of alleged perpetrators. Those records did not contain his own information however, so he was seeking to release information about other victims. 

Because there could have been an ongoing investigation and victims of SA have anonymity by law—she couldn’t have released those records regardless. It would have been in violation of the Victims Rights Act.

After reading the linked articles, I rated the one asking for a CN 'helpful' and the one saying No Note Needed/NNN as 'unhelpfull'.  If folks agree, please do the same.

Content: The reason I stay on X is to be aware of their narrative as well as to promote truth from the other side especially from our social media campaigns. No need to preach to the choir. We need to reach them by offering true facts, as well as monitor with CN corrections.

Content: Hi Steve – I appreciate hearing your thoughts. Over the last year, I, along with progressive & liberal friends, have come close to leaving X-twitter. Studies show it’s become more right-leaning in the last 2 years. Still, some big influencers stay there: Barack Obama has almost as many followers as Elon [And Taylor Swift is still there too – endorsement coming soon??? 😎  ].  I get lots of great content & news from those I follow, such as https://x.com/ProjectLincoln https://x.com/OccupyDemocrats https://x.com/swingleft https://x.com/ElevenFilms  https://x.com/KamalaHQ https://x.com/harris_wins https://x.com/DemCastUSA https://x.com/MeidasTouch
Also, here are some NEW groups for Kamala: Republicans for Harris https://x.com/RepsForHarris Swifties for Harris & Kamala https://x.com/Swiftie4Harris https://x.com/Swifties4Kamala Evangelicals for Harris https://x.com/Evangels4Harris   https://www.evangelicalsforharris.com/
 I’ve been more committed to staying since I’ve been doing community notes. Studies show that “X users repost content 61% less often once it receives a community note. Original posters delete their content faster once they receive a community note.”  - Dan

Content: Just to add more positivity: I’m involved with several grassroots organizations focused on SM, the largest of them being DemCastUSA.  We ran a Social Media Storm a week or so ago and we made 1.8 billion unique impressions on Twitter alone. I’ve been doing this for a while and Dan is correct regarding who you follow. Other #s to follow are DemsUnited, ProudBlue, BlueCrew, YesWeKam, WTPBlue, DemCast, & Allied4Dems.  

Also, follow Dems who have large accounts & post frequently:
 @RonFilipowski @MuellerSheWrote @RachelBitecofer @VoteVets @NickKnudsenUS @RBReich @TheRickyDavila @GlennKirschner2 @funder @David_Leavitt @TheRealLyndaCarter @ShannonWatts and so many more! 

 I ignore any MAGAs who reply on my posts. Those are the people you cant sway. I hide their replies and block them. Most of them are small accounts who enjoy trolling or are bots. 

If you stay in your Following feed, instead of For You, you avoid the negativity. It’s an algorithm: the more Dems you follow and repost while not engaging with MAGA, the more your feed becomes relevant to you. I don’t  see many MAGA/GOP posts even in my For You feed as I learned the hard way 😊 

If anyone wants to connect on Twitter, IG,or Threads I’m:  TheJenniWren I promise to follow back 💙

Don’t let the authoritarians stop us from moving forward. 
We’re Not Going Back and When We Fight, We Win!

Content: just a reminder, esp for anyone new to community notes: visiting the main page - https://x.com/i/communitynotes - and voting on other tweets is an easy way to raise your rating impact. only notes that reach enough votes count toward your rating score!

Content: There are lots of reasons to stay on X. One of mine is bc there's still no other platform that's better for news and current events aggregation, especially with Lists. Plus with Lists, you don't get ads.

Content: Hi everyone, I was curious if there are any comprehensive master-docs hyperlinked with reputable  sources/stats outlining failures and flawed logic of Trump/republican policies? Particularly economically? Many Americans in socioeconomic groups that republican policy historically harms are convinced Trump’s “economic superiority” justifies everything else. 

I’m hoping to find a database of resources similar to this document created by an activist in 2020, but haven’t found anything similar that’s more relevant to the 2024 election: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/e/2PACX-1vQu3FFQnKObUTmABEnw-s1TKYH9-9tpKXQoQYHAS-QjNiGcTE3vow42a99FXNi_ZoC0Q6gM9LfxasCe/pub?pli=1

The non-partisan Ballotpedia says the campaign’s slogan is 'Together, we can win this' https://bit.ly/3yJzjtQ Walz used the word 'joy' with no connection to Nazism at a rally: https://bit.ly/3MaTBQ5 " Hope it looks ok, did not take time to run by you.  May not appear right away. Note I linked to the entire Philly rally

I can't post a CN to the correct link Jennifer sent because I am at my daily limit. Can someone else please post mine or revise and post? A reminder to everyone we can leave comments by clicking the "Reply" button. Also, below each post is a "Related Posts" button that helps find other posts to reply to.

Content: Just rated and agreed with this CN:    "NNN - You might think you are bold and brash but this note belongs in the trash." 😎   I'm less likely to work on CN's like this one because they are easy to see through & do not cover priority issues like immigrations, economy, reproductive freedom

Content: The claim that a woman admitted to having an abortion on stage at the DNC is false. There is no evidence to support this. For accurate information, check credible sources like FactCheck.org and Snopes.

You might be able to link it from there!

Content: yeah, there's definitely a few here and there who use community notes to complain about other people's notes, but you don't have to vote on those or decide if their complaint is valid - just stick with the ones that you personally find helpful!

Content: **Community Notes:**

Recent reports claim Kamala Harris has withdrawn from the Fox News debate with Donald Trump. However, the initial debate was always scheduled for September 10 in Philadelphia, as confirmed by ABC News. The debate is set to begin at 9 p.m. ET. There is no official confirmation from Harris’s campaign about any changes to this schedule.

Content: Hi Folks -I'm rating the CN's that have been posted. For this topic of Trump's covid response, you can look for places to do CN's or responses. There are some attacks on Tim Walz calling him a 'covid tyrant'. Though more died during Biden's term, right wing misinformation continued & deaths will be a lagging indicator of policies & messages. Here's incredible research showing Trump caused 450K unnecessary deaths & the greatest driver of disinformation

Content: This post claiming it’s wrong to call Trump a “convicted felon” needs the CN proving that he is marked “helpful”. https://x.com/julie_kelly2/status/1825743459770118335?s=61&t=y_fNG0eJPWtO5JeFUYYauA

Content: I made replies  and rated CN's on falsehoods coming fast and furious [literally!] during the DNC last night.   I monitored: End Wokeness, MAGA War Room, RNC Research, Trump War Room, Collin Rugg & Heritage Foundation.  Hope you join me in doing that tonight.

Content: Hi everyone! I need help understanding if this article is true? It’s going viral on Reddit and Twitter. When I tried googling this morning, it was over ran by the same headline. 

Any insights on this? I run a community of 50k small business members. Would love to address this.

Content: Googling around a bit, I am seeing some of this stuff being repeated, the most neutral source I was able to find was Marketwatch, which at least provided links, some of the others seem maybe a little suspicious:

https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/kamala-harris-backs-bidens-tax-proposals-including-a-tax-on-unrealized-capital-gains-66c55df2

I can’t ascertain for sure whether the news is legit or not, but I think also it’s important to remember that her other proposals (the child tax credit, FTHB assistance, etc.) would put more money back in the pocket of the average American. Do most Americans even pay capital gains tax? And of those who do how many have to pay the top bracket of capital gains tax?

I’m confused as to why I’m not seeing the news reported by any of the typical news orgs though like CNN, MSNBC, even Fox I’m not seeing an article

Content: <@1046811731562856530> , you need to have 5 “helpful” responses to notes already posted before you can post your own notes or even written responses to other people’s notes. I suspect the helpful ratings may be manipulated a touch - i’ve been stuck at 4 for weeks.

Content: Thanks, Austin! I was able to put my CN on the Phantom Site but not the Harrell site since I can only do 1 a day - Here is my final version if someone wants to post it to Harrell: This video has been digitally altered. It adds audio that replaces the original audio. The false audio says, “Death to America,” but no such chanting occurred. Here is the actual video of the event from a Fox News station. https://youtu.be/Z832P-efBaM

Content: Oprah wealth -- Last night I was monitoring End Wokeness and other MAGA sites -- here is what I put in "Reply" on this post: "Yes, she is a billionaire -- that in no way negates her experience of racism, sexism and income inequality, One can empathize with hardships early in life and celebrate her successes and financial security later in life. She was born into poverty https://kennedy-center.org/artists/w/wa-wn/oprah-winfrey/ and lived in a poor section of Milwaukee." Was not well written. If anyone wants to use any of the wording for a CN - please go for it

Content: Really glad folks are looking at sites with huge followings - Elon, Trump, End Wokeness etc -- I think that can help us reach more people. I'm also trying to catch posts that are new. My hunch is that after 3-4 days posts may not circulate much.

Content: I put some responses [in "Reply"] to twitter posts last night. Trump had family members of those murdered by "illegals" speak yesterday at the border. Here is my post with best studies I could find that you can use in CN's and Replies: "Murders by undocumented immigrants are heartbreaking tragedies. Fortunately, they are rare & the undocumented murder at lower rates than those born in the U.S. Also, immigration is not tied to terrorism. A study of all 50 states found that an increase in undocumented immigration over 14 years, was NOT linked to terrorist attacks, radicalization, or terrorism prosecutions."  https://bit.ly/4diXQ7H  https://bit.ly/3WGnKf7 https://bit.ly/3U5eC3g

Content: So says things like:

Fighting to Set Murderers Free
Kamala Harris supported the Minnesota Freedom Fund, helping to bail out now-convicted murderers and violent criminals. One man freed by the bail fund went on to commit murder. She’ll bring the MFF’s policies to the White House.

Harris's Positions

Kamala Harris actively supports bailing violent criminals out of jail and allowing violent illegal aliens to roam our streets.

Case in point: Kamala Harris called on her supporters to “chip in” to the Minnesota Freedom Fund.

According to new reporting from CNN, that fund went on to bail out at least 65 people in a single county accused of “felony charges involving violence, physical threats or sex crimes. All were convicted.”

The MFF paid bail for looters arrested in the 2020 riots, for a twice-convicted rapist, a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, a man accused of a vicious assault and robbery, a man charged with attacking a woman in a restaurant bathroom, and even several serial domestic abusers — among dozens of other criminals.

That makes sense considering Kamala Harris supports ending cash bail — even for violent criminals.

Content: I’m not sure yet. Today some people have said their engagements are much lower than usual. I’m wondering if it depends on your hashtags and text. For example, I’ve been avoiding using Project 2025 unless I substitute a number or a letter. I use the felon instead of Trump.

Content: Hi. FYI It looks like the website (kamala2024policies.com) is created by the Republican National Committee – which when you think about it, it is even more egregious, to me, than when it's the Trump peeps. The RNC is a governing body of the Republican party — and to put out such crap seems just wrong. Blows my mind.

Content: It's a technology thing.

Someone found a flaw within the Twitter app and was able to find some information which may or may not be useful.

Sometimes, companies will pay people (i.e. "bug bounties") who find flaws in their software/app.

Content: Hey everyone, very silly narrative today on Twitter that Walz has a fake dog or doesnt know his dogs name. This is an obvious lie, here are a couple accounts which are sharing this misnfo:
https://x.com/GrageDustin/status/1828065388325744762
https://x.com/MostlyPeacefull/status/1828075034210177070

and here is a full video of Walz at the dog park with both dogs. He has many picture with his dog scout, and merely took a picture with this other dog from the dog park.
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkBMwZGprB2/?hl=en

we would appreciate any CNs on these, thanks!

Content: I couldn't find the CN re Tammy Baldwin.  Wrote this instead. Dear Eric, I can understand you want (and are running for) Tammy Baldwin's seat as junior Senator from Wisconsin, but Eric, wishful thinking is not reality.  Presenting false information about your competitor tells me 1) you can't be trusted and 2) you do not respect the intelligence of your target audience --Wisconsin voters. Midwesterners, as you should know, are more savvy media consumers.

Content: From St. Louis, MO: Did you know that the online website (http://www.stlelections.com) for the City of St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners for the City of St. Louis is not active when I checked today? Here’s a message for it: “BUY THIS DOMAIN The domain stlelections.com may be for sale by its owner!” Is anyone looking into whether this could be happening elsewhere? It took a few different phone calls to finally get a “live person” and mention it. Just wondering 🤔

Content: Hi there. I hope this is the right place to ask this. There is a post from Vance on Twitter accusing Walz of lying about IVF. As a woman who has done much more intense IVF forms but been given the option of IUI and step by step info on it, I can say 100% he’s wrong. It often requires meds that are just as painful. It is almost as expensive as more intense forms. It has a lesser chance of success. I’m panicking seeing this lie because I already get attacked enough about IVF, and accused that I’m exaggerating about how difficult it is.

Content: By the way, I confirmed that St. Louis County Board of Elections is separate from the City of St. Louis. So, this is interesting. In that you’re right, a gov website should not have a .com extension. But I called 314.622.4336 for the Board of Election Commissioners and heard the voice message giving the website address with the extension .com. 🧐

Content: Good morning fellow patriots!  I'm wondering, how long it takes to be approved to write community notes?  I can request that a community note be made and I can rate community notes already made, but cannot create my own yet.  I applied to community notes sometime last week and expected to be able to create notes by now. Is there something additional I need to do or check?  Any suggestions would be welcome.  Thanks!

Apparently I still cannot make community notes but someone else can please post this link as evidence against the original false statement.

Content: Hi Miranda, great question. It can take months to get approved to write notes, Im not sure of any actions that can expedite that process. Im still waiting from almost 3 months ago. But your ratings and request for notes are still incredibly impactful!!!!

Content: Yeah. Sometimes the links are just to the tweets and not the CNs. You can take the tweet "ID" and tack it onto the end of "https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t/" - so in this case you would go to: https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t/1828941425859539276

Content: Wow, that's really too bad it's taking so long to get approved to write CNs!  I think it took me three weeks. Approval was based on my impact score. I got messages saying I needed to reach 5. If you go to Community Notes and open 'Your Profile' you will see your impact rating. Each time your rating joins with others to be determined to be helpful or unhelpful, you will raise your rating by 1.  So the more ratings, the faster you'll get there.

Content: Hello. My community notes still hasn’t been approved but I still wanted to contribute and help others. I have created the thread I link to on this comment. I plan to update it regularly and add more topics. It will always be pinned at the top of my profile. It contains credible sources and media material for a range of topics that Trumpists most obviously post falsely about. Bipartisan border bill is particularly detailed. Feel free to take; no need to cite me or anything! And if there are topic ideas you have, @ me with suggestions/requests!

Content: I met with concerned citizens yesterday. They asked about whom we are calling or texting: Are these people Republicans, Independents, or non-voters? Is there data on the effectiveness of postcard or letter sending through approved organizations? Are we calling on behalf of the Harris campaign alone, or are we call to support Congressional candidates also?

Content: Tony TB -- question: do you (or anyone else here) think it's a good idea to have a link/invite to DISCORD (this virtual office) on the Linktree acct (also-I know nothing about Linktree fyi). There can  be the opposition finding this account (and doing the same effort we are to take things down) Note I am still new to DISCORD but does't that open the door for the trolls. Your thoughts?

Content: I've replied to a few of the CN's on this post.  What makes this one tricky for me to rate is there is no definitive source of proof one way or the other.  It seems to me that if there is "evidence" that this video is a set-up, it would be the fact that there is a picture of the girl's injuries in addition to the video of the supposed assault in the same post, literally uploaded together at the same time.  

Would an assailant ever ask their victim to pose for a close-up picture of their injuries after they've assaulted them?  It seems even less likely that the victim would agree and actually pose for the picture, but that is what we are essentially being asked to believe based on this post. It seems most logical that if this were a real incident, the video would be uploaded by the perpetrator on their social media account, and the picture of the victim's injuries after the assault would be posted later by the victim on their social media account, once they are out of harms way.  The video and picture being present in the same post is fair evidence that this was a set-up.

If anyone would like to make another CN based on this point please feel free to do so.  This is the type of post where there may not be a way to prove or disprove definitively, but presenting a logical argument is the best that can be done until  law enforcement does an actual investigation.  Thanks everyone!

Content: I don't am not able to pay community notes.  However walz is introduced before his speech with the preface of his overseas trip.  He was concerned from the conversations that he had with troops. That's how he's introduced before Walz says,  "when I was in Afghanistan.

Content: Musk is straight up trolling. That picture is AI generated and notice he doesn't link to a source of the picture, any related article, or some sort of source that isn't his own ego (or something he wrote as a prompt in generative ML/AI like DOLL-E)

My take? Let's let the legal eagles within the campaign review and have them inform us on an action.

It's quite another when the CEO of an online Social Media platform decides to do something potentially libelous.

Content: That picture doesn't even look like Kamala. If anything, it looks more like Katey Sagal from Sons of Anarchy.

Come to think about it, I bet the word "anarchy" was added in the initial prompt, which informed the creation of the picture. XD

Content: Yeah, the hate speech and disinformation being pushed there has real life consequences that cause unnecessary suffering and loss of life, especially to diverse communities, such as the BIPOC community, disability community, and SROGIESC+ (LGBTQIA2S+) community. Even those who have certain privileges based on their personal background aren't safe.

Content: This is absolutely HORRIBLE.  I would like another billionaire like Cuban or someone who supports democracy to start a social media platform.  imo he is a threat to our democracy. Or would be great if congress started one or someone who made a platform owned by the public maybe.  I agree with <@779382569534881824> that he should in no way be allowed to run twitter. he's wrecked it.  how do you even do community notes for a post? Does he ban anyone who writes them?  I don't feel like anyone sees the twitter content i post anymore since he took over. am brand new to discord. watched tutorials. still figuring out how it works.

Content: He is actively undermining our democracy.  I wish there was  a way to stop that.  His PAC also created that website that misleads voters in swing states to think they have been registered to vote, when they have not!

Content: I found many CN on Kamala as a commie: https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t/1830656672211103825  I think they are at bottom or you have to click to open full tweet. This is the type of post that often DOES get enough ratings to be accepted because it is AI generated photo

Content: I rated some as helpful and some as unhelpful. The more explicitly opinionated ones (especially the one that links to an MSNBC op-ed) are less likely to stand even if they're initially approved, and are less likely to sway people on the fence.

Content: I responded, no cn could be attached. It is an obvious use of misinformation using his social media platform to overthrow an election. As he used foreign money to buy it, there could be legal issues.

Content: CNs – after written and attached to a post, the CN needs to be "rated" by other users (on x/twitter) "with a history of different views" before can be attached to the post and seen live. Supporting links are needed and opinion doesn't get rates. When I see something like this post -- adding my 2cents in the comments will be seen sooner. For super ugly posts I come back and keep adding comment so will fill the feed. It's not a pretty moment in the social media world right now but I do believe noise can cancel noise.

Content: Hi Izzy-- I routinely try to 1) look at right-wing accounts with large audiences: End Wokeness, MAGA War Room, RNC Research, Trump War Room, Collin Rugg, Heritage Foundation [Elon Musk - see article I posted earlier today 2) recent posts, usually up to 3-4 days old.  I also look at new posts https://x.com/i/communitynotes/new   I may leave a comment if I can't add a community note.  To get facts, try a google search that starts "fact check" & also look at sites like Politifact, Factcheck.org, Snopes, & Kessler at Wash Post.

Content: Has anyone from the campaign responded officially to the alleged photo of the Nebraska Family of Tim Walz supporting Trump/Pence? There are some credible arguments it is an AI image (several hands have only 4 fingers and the "sharpened talon" look of AI fingers). I requested a CN; I'm not part of the program, but if someone else can post an explanatory one we can rate it Helpful. It's being picked up by MSM (MSNBC, Newsweek) as true with no context or questioning if its AI. I think context &/or explanation if AI, is needed.

Content: Some are suggesting it is AI, and their point seems like it bears investigating, as it seems reasonable. I don;t know how to check images like that, if someone does that's be good.

Content: Yes, community notes are appearing on this fake story. Here is a fact-check article that seems the best to use in Reply & CN's -- likely a Russian fake story -- fasten your seat belts --AG Garland shut down one Russian site today https://www.snopes.com/news/2024/09/03/harris-hit-and-run/

Content: <@852586668212748388>  with this said: "the notes we write or the notes we vote on will never reach Helpful/Not Helpful status" do you think all the CN posts and ratings we do are included in any algorithm on x/twitter?

Content: I mean.... who knows, honestly? according to the CN guidelines, as far as I understand it, a CN needs both enough votes from people and from people with varying viewpoints for it to be shown, but whether a CN affects anything else is anyone's guess

Content: How long does it take for your rating impact to be updated? I’ve been rating for about a week but last night it finally showed up in my profile and I was prompted to start rating. I went through a number of notes last night but it still says 0 and that I haven’t rated any notes yet! 🤷

Content: That's really interesting. (Thanks for clarifying.) I've been in CN since the first week it was announced and many, if not most,  of my up/down votes have been published. That does lead me to believe Elmo is fiddling with some algo or something.

Content: RE Note Acceptance: My experience writing notes is the same as Kristen -- I've written 29 notes, and none were accepted, so my writing score is 0. I often take the material in my note and turn it into a reply -- about half the time, I'm pleased to say I get likes [Dems reading MAGA sites] & sometimes I have short conversations with conservatives who respond to me with myths I try to correct. When my ratings of helpful or unhelpful reach enough consensus with others, I get a notice that my vote was useful. My rating score increases right away and is now 52.

Content: Also intentionally downscaled (resized smaller) from a larger image. The grainy-ness of it would likely hide any telltale signs of AI generation that would be visible on a higher quality image (eg a swirl pattern on various objects).

Content: I'll put one together now. Correction: We need a tweet that accuses Harris of bussing people in. Counter notes don't really do anything and in my experience, they don't garner votes. Ultimately they can negatively affect the writer's score.

Content: Not to be pedantic, but putting a counter note to a community note that doesn't say "NNN" is likely to negatively impact your score. I'm looking for a tweet that makes that false claim.

Content: basically yeah, but if you want to bump it up a little, go to the community notes section and vote on a few of the "needs your help" ones - they probably won't all be political ones but they're generally more likely to end up with enough votes to each a consensus

Content: I've will continue to rate CNs as requested but in addition – I am using the bulk of my SM monitoring time to reply in reply/comments. Any one else doing this (i see you are <@1263626794951774320>)?   TIP from what I see...when a post from Harris campaign post negative for DT -- most all the comments are Trump supporters. When Trump campaign puts out a negative one on Harris – most reply/comments are Harris supporters. SO – you guessed it – I go into the reply/comments and add my counter comments. I feel like if we had an army of folks posting these counter comments – might make some impact.

Content: Ted Cruz Migrant Claim -- Anna -thanks for letting us know about this  -- I just posted this CN [may not show for a while]-- took time to check every link in Fox articles - ZERO evidence. I did overkill with 4 citations but thought you could use. CN: No evidence is given by Cruz or Fox News that Harris is coordinating with Mexico to bus migrants. For the safety of asylum-seekers fleeing persecution, Mexico escorts migrants north only if they have an appointment with an asylum officer https://bit.ly/4dQ98kB Here’s what she’s done & will do https://politi.co/4fM4TIb https://cnn.it/3XvTV2j https://wapo.st/3ABKjtI

Content: Was this CN written by someone in support of the campaign?  I ask because the link in the CN goes to a non existent account which does not help the CN’s credibility.

Content: <@1082643965167288360> the account linked was the fake account someone created that was being used in the post to claim the shooter was a supporter of VP. It looks like it has since been removed/suspended by Twitter.

Seen this 4 times on X today.  Is this something we would want community notes for?  Forgive the newbie if not.

Content: Hi! New member of this group. I hadn't used my account since EM took it over, but it's now out of mothballs. So far, I've gone back through 8/31 (thank you for the birdwatch links!) to upvote and downvote as needed.  I'll keep digging through the old posts, and hopefully I'll be cleared to create CNs soon. My handle there is amyberner

Content: <@677289927565639712> Hi. I'm still new to CN – what is "upvote"? Does that mean to rate it? Also can you add the "birdwatch" tag in your links to posts so it gets to the notes. Thanks!

Content: Is the community note not visible? I didn’t write the note but I posted it here because I thought it needed rating. The poster is basically blaming Biden and us policies for the death of the hostages.

Content: Adding more notes really has no impact - except a potentially negative impact on your CN profile. The post states an opinion. Political disagreements belong in replies not in CN.

The tweet isn't even really debatable. It's a list of grievances. There are already a bunch of CNs that are pointless and should be down voted.

Content: I think we need to exercise discretion in CN. There's way too much abuse going on by the MAGAe already, we don't want to be a part of that. Factually incorrect tweets or tweets that truly misrepresent context should usually get a CN. Beyond that, you're risking your CN profile being stagnated by posting unnecessary CN. 

My guiding principle: THE MAGAe are lost to America. We're not dumbf**k whisperers. Use CN for its stated purpose and confine political arguments to replies or quote tweets.

My opinion.

Content: I'm new here, but maybe this is helpful about debunking the bussing of supporters in NH. Because of insufficient parking and security reasons, supporters were told to park in a lot and take a bus to the rally. Here's a NH newspaper story debunking it:

Content: Hi Kristin - I think generally I know what we are to be doing, though it's worth moderator input. I think we could be more effective if we set some priorities for which posts are most important [am guessing at any one time there are hundreds of CN's to rate]-- so some group discussion might be good. 2-3 times, I sent out my priorities and strategies, recently for Izzy, where I said: I routinely try to 1) look at right-wing accounts with large audiences: End Wokeness, MAGA War Room, RNC Research, Trump War Room, Collin Rugg, Heritage Foundation [Elon Musk - see article I posted earlier today 2) recent posts, usually up to 3-4 days old.  I also look at new posts at https://x.com/i/communitynotes/new   I may leave a comment if I can't add a community note because I only get to post one CN a day  To get facts, try a google search that starts "fact check" & also look at sites like Politifact, Factcheck.org, Snopes, & Kessler at Wash Post."  I've become more skeptical of my impact after writing 30 CN's and not having one posted. On the other hand one of my responses on Trump's account has had 14,000 views and lots of likes and reposts: https://x.com/BeTheLight02/status/1832253682689167547

Content: The ratings impact/score is pretty much a mystery to me as well 😂 but yeah agreed that some campaign feedback on what we should prioritize would really go a long way

Content: I don't think it can be adequately disputed within the framework of CN. You could post it as a your tweet and write a thread that disputes it point by point, though, which would likely have more reach than the few characters available in CN.

Content: Hi Dan, I don't know if one of the CN on this was yours but I rated each one "not helpful." These are perfect examples of what the CN framework is not meant for. Ultimately, CNs that are partisan or use biased language or don't have cites and those that receive "Not Helpful" status will harm the reach, impact and ratings of the person who posts them. 

I do agree we need a moderator in this thread to provide some guidance along with maybe four or five regular users to scan for posts that **do** qualify for CNs. I would be happy to help in any way I can be useful. 

I think your approach, Dan, is really good and could be utilized by all of the CN volunteers here.

I think we are underutilizing this program on Twitter and with some concentrated attention we could make a difference and reach some of the persuasable lurkers out there.

<@&1245831457818279986> can we get some input here please?

Content: The falsehoods keep on a comin'. 😎  There were posts on this topic and some good CN's back in July. Here is just one with helpful CN's that can be paraphrased and posted now.  Here is one of several fact-check articles -- some discuss the difficulty MAGA seems to have with the idea of multi-racial identity  & not understanding the history of the 'one drop' concept. Here is an example of how I do search terms in Google: "fact check is Kamala Harris black?"://x.com/i/birdwatch/t/1815460363426816069  https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/kamala-harris-has-long-identified-black-contrary-trump-claim-2024-08-01/

Content: Hi Nikki - thanks for all the comments! Good point about "Not Helpful" ratings likely to harm the impact of the person who posts [not sure what CN I might have posted]. Good idea to have several of us scanning certain accounts -- I have done this to find posts on the accounts I listed earlier that often reach millions. We can have the most impact with new posts. We could divide up this task. Yes, I do believe there are persuadable voters out there. I will be turning more to using "Response" postings than CN postings. A response on Trump's account has reached 15K with 300 reposts -- maybe then reaching persuadable?  I'm guessing that to get a CN approved for attachment to a post, it takes 20-40 helpful responses with low or no unhelpful ratings?? I think to have an impact we need more than a handful of us doing ratings. I might encourage some online-engagement folks to join us - Dan

Content: Gas Prices: There are now some good CN's. on this post https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t/1831813445500510406    . I just rated those I thought were most clear, with good citations. YES, this is a topic to address -- experts say perceptions of the economy are driven most by what consumers see in front of their eyes regularly -- gas and groceries -- they don't see GDP, employment rates, average wages, etc. My fear has been that oil-producing countries that want Trump will restrict oil production just before the election

Content: <@1263626794951774320> I think it would be effective to coordinate efforts and make the most impact. I spend most of my time adding comments in the “reply” on posts. Finding the MAGA post-ers that get the most eyeballs – (thank you for this list: End Wokeness, MAGA War Room, RNC Research, Trump War Room, Collin Rugg, Heritage Foundation, Elon Musk) – be nice to organize us here adding to the reply/comments section on select (from list above) posts, perhaps could have some impact.

Content: Well, I agree with both of you 😎  -- myths about fentanyl and immigrants are both huge issues. I'd like us to respond to both and it makes sense since they are tied together. Yesterday the Heritage Foundation https://x.com/Heritage put out a big report on the fentanyl crisis - blaming China for sending the raw ingredients & blaming Kamala for an open border letting drugs in. Truth is most fentanyl is brought in by US citizens with vehicles at entry ports.  Kamala supports the bipartisan bill that would fund badly needed detection machines.

Content: On some level, this disgusting stuff put out by Vance and the like, has got to turn off some more of their supporters as  just desperate for attention & a vote. They are running out of subjects to use. They pissed off a lot of veterans for DT after the Arlington moment. In my mind they're showing What Weird Is. Sad - but I got to keep going.

I may be a strange one who never really enjoyed social media very much although this community of like minded folks is really motivating me to engage.  I've never accepted anyone following me on Twitter on purpose nor have I ever tweeted.  This effort and community may cause me to put my toe in the water.  Thanks again.

Hey gang, I just posted the message below on Twitter. 
Share if you like.

---------------
It is the job of those of us who pay close attention to news and politics to TRY to educate those who do not.
Those who watch or read news only from their echo chambers are already lost. 
But there are still  undecided voters. Help them make the best choice! 
How? Please, folks..

- send a link to the complete debate last night to ANYone you know will be voting, especially if you know they are 'undecided! Send it to everyone you know who says they aren't voting because "...there's no good choice"
...and ask THEM to share it.
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-harris-and-trump-debate-pbs-news-simulcast-of-abcs-2024-presidential-debate
Only ONE candidate on the stage in this debate was intelligent, prepared, self-controlled.
Only ONE candidate passes the Commander in Chief test. 
Anyone who watched should be able to see which one. I don't even need to name HER. 
SHE will be a president for ALL Americans.

----------

Content: Hi - I'm pondering how effective pics of big game hunting will work. Parts of the OH stories are "weird" yet fear of immigrants is likely what got Trump elected once and might again -- it worked for Mussolin1 and Orban. Most effective I think will be: 1) video moment of moderator fact-checking Trump at the debate re  eating pets, 2) quotes from several good fact-checking  articles like this one https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/09/social-media/authorities-rebut-claims-that-haitian-immigrants-a/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1725928009-1  Might message JD suggesting he meet with Haitians who are Catholics like him - like mom and daughter at Creole Mass in pic in NPR piece https://www.npr.org/2024/08/12/nx-s1-5055784/immigration-vance-trump-migration-president-migrants-election-ohio

Content: Also easy quick rebuttal image: 
They are Tiffany Earrings. (Most likely partially custom due to the size of pearls on hers). But here is the Tiffany listing for the same ones. She has worn these many many times

Content: Oh my, I did not know this was a thing. Is the implication that Joe Biden was telling her what to say?! Simple solution is for Kamala to urge an added rule in the next debate [he has yet to accept] - neither candidate is allowed to wear earrings 😎  Oh, I did rate this one

Content: Ok. So it’s important to push back and write and rate CNs but let’s keep in mind the solemnity of today. Take your cues from the campaign and the principles (VP Harris and Gov Walz) and not actively push partisan narratives on 9/11.

Content: I am on Twitter because my hockey family lives there.  I created a campaign account on Twitter because that's where the Trumpsters live.
Happily I haven't seen my hockey family from my campaign account, which follows all of the darkness and dungeons available on interwebs.
I have to watch Colbert and Jon Steward daily to lift myself up.

Content: Twitter - Is It Worth It? Hi -- here is how I responded to someone else raising your very real concern: I appreciate hearing your thoughts. Over the last year, I, along with progressive & liberal friends, have come close to leaving X-twitter. Studies show it’s become more right-leaning in the last 2 years. Still, some big influencers stay there: Barack Obama has almost as many followers as Elon [And Taylor Swift is still there too}   ].  I get lots of great content & news from those I follow, such as https://x.com/ProjectLincoln https://x.com/OccupyDemocrats https://x.com/swingleft https://x.com/ElevenFilms  https://x.com/KamalaHQ https://x.com/harris_wins https://x.com/DemCastUSA https://x.com/MeidasTouch
Also, here are some NEW groups for Kamala: Republicans for Harris https://x.com/RepsForHarris Swifties for Harris & Kamala https://x.com/Swiftie4Harris https://x.com/Swifties4Kamala Evangelicals for Harris https://x.com/Evangels4Harris   https://www.evangelicalsforharris.com/
 I’ve been more committed to staying since I’ve been doing community notes. Studies show that “X users repost content 61% less often once it receives a community note. Original posters delete their content faster once they receive a community note.”  - Dan

Content: Thing is, Twitter isn’t going away until it’s shut down. And many of us have had accounts for over a decade at this point. Many of us aren’t on threads or know people who aren’t because “omg not another social media thing”—- plus it’s owned by Facebook’s overarching company and isn’t any better in the long run other than Zuckerberg doesn’t go round like a banshee like musk does.

Content: Black Twitter is still on there. And since Kamala Harris started her campaign,  KHive has been on in full force over there. Plus Twitter is where I still get more news than threads where last night I got cut off from posting about the debate half way through. There really is still no substitute unfortunately.

Content: Remember all the “Twitter wannabes” that sprang up after Leon took over? None gained the traction Twitter has. It remains a prime spot for tracking MAGA talking points (lies) and knowing how to refute them. This morning, a MAGA supporter listed all the "lies" Kamala supposedly told, straight from his community. I compiled a thread using Trump’s own words to refute his post. That’s why I’m staying on this cesspool—it's the frontline for battling disinformation in real time.

Content: Here is the link to an image explaining that the so-called ear piece does not exist. https://x.com/TrumpluvsObama/status/1834178137972002970/photo/1  I'll keep an eye out for a better resource.  I cannot write a CN but I have replied to this post with the reference I listed above.

Content: Laura Loomer -- I pushed back on some of her posts weeks ago and lately have ignored her because her audience is small -- now this week, we see she is hanging out with The Donald - that's where he gets some of his craziest ideas. Seems it's easier to get CN's accepted the easier it is to show falsehoods l-- so hope that's true for her https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/laura-loomer-donald-trump-influence/index.html

Content: Well, I couldn't stay away from Laura Loomer -- went to her site and saw her pinned message was about Kamala lying about fracking. Here is my reply. I am playing with messages that enter the frame of the other person [as a therapist, I know that is a way to reach the delusional] - empathizing when I can, sharing my own feelings and saying to Republicans - hey, you can find your better angels. I live on the edge of being snarky  & hope I am not. I may not reach Laura, but if I can just get one of her fans to think  . . . .  Suggestions/comments welcome on my approach https://x.com/BeTheLight02/status/1834319102115975559

Content: Thanks to those who reposted my 1st Loomer response & pos. comments. Will check out how to add to list. Laura Loomer talked about a lot on msnbc last hour. Get this - Marjorie Taylor Greene called her out for a racist, vulgar post!! what has the world become!!? Also Loomer is a 9/11 denier & went to 9/11 vigil with Trump. Here is my second response, example of starting with "I have good news" to see if folks open the door emotionally a little with positive anticipation https://x.com/BeTheLight02/status/1834354984357368298

Content: I know you have your list up and just followed.  I just created a twitter handle @Trumpelstilzchn as I decided to engage further and here is my first post https://twitter.com/Trumpelstilzchn/status/1834361255022243975

In reponse to your earlier post "Maddie — Today at 5:08 PM
I retweeted your reply @Dan S but I wish there an way we can find each others posts and support those voices. I would suggest creating a list where we can all support each other. Any thoughts?"

Alternatively to get a direct link to a tweet in a web browser at least is, if you click on the three dots/elipses on a post to the right of the profile name and twitter handle, you will get a pop up window with an option to "Embed post" which opens another window with a link that you can copy.

Content: It depends on objectives. If the objective is to find and amplify voices that you agree with I could see using lists but if the objective is to build community then I could see using community. But isn't community building with what you are doing here on Discord? I am good with either. Just let me know.

There are already some CN's to be voted on but not sure if any came from this community. https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t/1834303917208842424

They include some good content that could be included in a reply, I just haven't created one and will advise if I do.  I saw Space Karen Elon replied.

Content: There are still Dems and Harris-Walz supporters there (like me! 😊) who haven't gone elsewhere because they are used to Twitter and too old to learn some of the newer apps like Instagram. Plus, a lot of the old faces like President Obama and other well known celebs are still on X and use it.
I joined in April of 2010..

Content: Fair enough. My apologies. The main thing is to get and share Campaign content out on as many social platforms as possible.  On the up side I had a Harris post viewed 240,852 times and has been liked 15,628 times thus far.  We should all go where we are productive. 😁

Content: Twitter is a cesspool but I find that many undecideds are still there. 

For example: I had a conversation with a black Independent who asked the "What has the Biden-Harris admin done for black people." I replied with my list but of course he said he was "looking for talking points" Here is my reply I probably should have kept my cool. https://x.com/Mad_as_heII/status/1833939766506869114

Content: This part:
“Solomon’s economists predicted earlier this month that the United States’s GDP could take a hit in a hypothetical victory by former President Donald Trump in 2024, whereas a Harris 2024 victory could lead to a “very slight boost” to the GDP. The vice president referenced the report during Tuesday night’s debate, with Solomon now stating that it was conducted by “an independent analyst” and has created a bigger discussion “than should be.””

Content: Funny how Goldman-Sachs quibles over "2/10ths"  gain w/Harris win.  If it were the other way around and  the Orange Felon was quoting this we would just roll with it... because it would be the only true statement coming out of his mouth.    When  Harris says something that's TRUE but only marginally true it seems like a big deal!   LOL. 
I'll take growth in GDP over shrinking GDP any day. .. no matter how many tenths it is.

Content: The Republicans historically have been. HORRIBLE for the economy.  Every one of them (even Saint Reagan) drove the economy into the ditch and left it to a DEMOCRAT to get us out of the ditch and back on stable ground.
Kamala/Tim need to go on the attack on the economy!   Republicans can't be trusted with the purse strings.  Every R administration gives away the store to their rich friends and creates a brief Pop in the economy followed by extreme crisis and hardship for everyone else.  It needs to stop.

Content: You did your best, it's all we can do! It is hard to tell who is real and who is a bot. Who is serious and who is trolling. I look at people's timeline before responding. That guy was critical of the great Nelson Mandela and called the USA a cancer; and his account pic & name were offensive.  So good for you for not backing down, I just blocked him. 😆

He is lying. That is not what was said. He implied Harris may have overstated the impact of their report. He most certainly did NOT state his policies would grow the economy. Washington Examiner shares the cnbc vid.

Content: He also said (the next day) that the difference between the two projections was only .2 percent.  
So the total multiplied by .002.  So I don't think it's an argument I want to hang my hat on.

Content: JD's Lies about Springfield/Kamala - Here's a gush of lies from JD. https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t/1834785910635794774 Has 1 CN & could use more, plus Replies. I can't do CN's - here is material from my replies you're welcome to use: The Feds DHS used U.S. law (Code §1254a) to give non-criminal Haitians Temporary Protected Status (TPS). DHS determined in 2021: “Haiti is currently experiencing serious security concerns, social unrest, an increase in human rights abuses, crippling poverty & lack of basic resources.” TPS was extended because Haiti is ruled by violent gangs. As for being a burden, migrants help our economy mightily – doing work unwanted by others & paying billions in taxes each year.  https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1254a&num=0&edition=prelim https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024/#:~:text=Key%20Findings,to%20state%20and%20local%20governments  Reports of crimes by Haitians in Springfield are not true. Deputy Dir of Public Safety says: I think it's sad that some people are using this as an opportunity to spread hate or spread fear. We get these reports 'the Haitians are killing ducks in a lot of our parks' or 'the Haitians are eating vegetables right out of the aisle at the grocery store'. And we haven't really seen any of that. It's really frustrating. As a community, it's not helpful as we try to move forward. https://npr.org/2024/08/12/nx-s1-5055784/immigration-vance-trump-migration-president-migrants-election-ohio  Republican CEO of a  plant: "I think this whole notion of migrants taking American jobs is hogwash.” 30 new Haitian workers were vital to filling the worker gap. “I mean, the fact of the matter is, without the Haitian associates that we have, we had trouble filling these positions.”https://npr.org/2024/08/12/nx-s1-5055784/immigration-vance-trump-migration-president-migrants-election-ohio

Content: Is CNN doing this for both campaigns or just the Harris-Walz campaign? I’m all for fact-checking, but it loses credibility when it only scrutinizes one side. This article criticizes the Harris-Walz campaign without mentioning the lies from the Trump camp. To the casual reader, this imbalance paints an unfair picture. That said, CNN is going to CNN.

Content: CNN -- Good question!  There are many fact checks of Trump from CNN - they use Daniel Dale who is one of the best in the world, e.g. see below.  I have a collection of 40 fact-checking articles from several sources  [a version posted here earlier].  There is only one fact check article on Kamala and it was by Factcheck.org. All the others fact check Trump and JD. This is the first fact check by CNN like this. Note: It only covers KamalaHQ and NOT other Harris accounts. My concern is that the entire Harris campaign will lose credibility if HarrisHQ continues any intentional or unintentional distortions. One can assess the merits of the CNN claims directly -- it may be an important teachable moment for the HQ team and a way to make our postings more accurate. 😎  https://cnn.it/3AkDFIm

Content: On Twitter, MAGA accounts are expanding the 'Haitians killing pets' lie.
1. They are now making references to pet killings in other states.
2. They are implicating all immigrants of color, not just Haitians.
3. They don't care about the immigration status of the POC.

I understand that they are trying to distract away from Trump and Project 2025 but this 💩 is dangerous.

Content: I am also drawing parallels between this noise vs. that which was happening during the 2020 election.

HOWEVER, this is likely why we are focusing our efforts on turning down the noise and/or volume, providing factual sources, and reporting what we find. By doing so, we are providing important data to the campaign and folks who can compare and contrast what they are noticing among other channels.

Take heart (and take breaks!). The volume (in terms of mass, how "loud" the voices are, and who is amplifying) is meant to be exhausting and scary. The goals of this BS is to:

1) Keep people from voting. Schools, churches, and community centers are often the places people go to cast their ballots.

2) To further prove/cement the BS in folks' minds by the reaction to the BS. For example: Say something absurd, get a reaction, then use the reaction as proof that the absurd is true.

Let's do our best to ignore the noise and focus on our goals: Just The Facts, Report, Upvote, and get the folks who take our NatSec seriously into office. ❤️

Dan is 100% correct bc I did the same homework and arrived at the same conclusion. 
@kamalaHQ messed up big time and I'd like an explanation for this. I have to know the content I share all over the darn place is truthful. They need every Vid on their SM feeds reviewed and QA' d. 
This was an unforced error that I pray will not haunt an otherwise flawlessly run campaign.

Content: I read and viewed the entire article. I'm not buying satire. CNN laid it out clearly and made a good case against us. The spliced video for the hook they curated. I saw those damn memes shared everywhere. I want KamalaHQ to explain what the heck they were thinking. I hope Jen O'Malley Dillion has seen this. It needs to be elevated asap.

Content: the best way to alert Harris's campaign and Kamala HQ about this, would be to contact them through their website, i'd say. 

https://kamalaharris.com/contact-us/

as far as us in here, there's not much any of us can do.

Content: <@957714233217409174> that's fine. I sent a Tweet (or whatever a post is called over there these days) to her account. She never posts so the account always looks like it's not in use, but shes modified the account profile when she became Kamala's CM. Maybe she'll read it maybe she won't. Depends if her notifications are on. Probably not. New problems are always the last thing you want. But 💩 like this you need a plan.

Content: honestly, the article is a bit nit-picky and none of the edit was any worse than what the trump campaign has shown in commercials about Kamala. I live in GA so I have seen nothing but Trump commericals for the last month on YouTube and they're truly terrible. Where's the fact-check on those?

Content: While that may be true, let's focus on what went right with the election.

- Audits showed any fraud was negligible.
- Some states allow undocumented folks to vote in state and local elections, which makes sense because those will have more of an impact on where they live and work. We cannot know someone's immigration status just by looking at them.
- People/groups of people settle out of court either to save time, court resources, or because doing so may be less expensive in the long run.
- Districts and election offices across the nation have stepped up their game to ensure the security of our elections moving forward.

Content: inflation is going down, but cost of services and cost of property/rent kept going up. wages raised but not enough to adjust to meet those costs. groceries costs also went up. in 2020-2021, cost was due to pandemic, causing supply chain issues. in 2022, it was caused by Russia attacking Ukraine. by 2023 the inflation started to improve thanks to the push by the Biden administration to cap the cost of medicine. but since businesses weren't facing a cap, they started charging more despite making record gains the past few years. 

long story short: Big Business decided the best business practice was to charge more because no one has room to complain. 

the resources i used for this is <https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/business/economy/what-causes-inflation.html> and this <https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-caused-the-u-s-pandemic-era-inflation/>. there's a better one but i can't find it at the moment.

Content: That “both parties engage in similar unethical behaviors when it suits them, circle the wagons around their own while trying to prosecute the other side’s misdeeds (Republicans defended Kavanagh, Democrats defended Clinton),” is why a third of the nation doesn’t vote. It’s also why another undetermined chunk votes based solely on lower taxes. “If both sides are dirty, may as well vote for paying less to the government” is a very real sentiment among undecideds who vote right.

The person who made those posts has now made both those problems worse. Congratulations.

Second, if it’s only “wrong” when the other side does it, then it’s not “wrong.” The ability to assess (and condemn) your own is essential to any kind of ethics, or even just not ending up in a cult.

Whoever made and greenlit these posts should be fired. I won’t be retweeting from that account again.

Content: What is the goal of our work with community notes?  It seems impossible to battle the most egregious misinformation using community notes.  I've been voting on many notes battling the misinformation about Hatians eating pets, and none have gotten through.  I also checked on the most popular posts spreading this, and none have notes.  The way the system is set up, it doesn't seem like dearly held lies spread by Republicans can have notes attached since people from both sides have to agree that it needs a note.  https://communitynotes.x.com/guide/en/contributing/diversity-of-perspectives

Content: Our goal is to add additional context to misleading tweets, countering misinformation as it relates to the Harris-Walz campaign and this upcoming presidential election. I'm not as well versed in Twitter, so I'm not sure why you aren't seeing many community notes on your end for the posts that seem to be the most egregious. Let me check back in with the team to get you a better answer and see if I can also share techniques/strategies for overcoming these challenges!

Content: Goal of Community Notes - Thanks Peter for raising this issue and to Gabrielle for her response. We've had a discussion on this topic on this channel in the last week & earlier 1) CN's very seldom get approved to be attached to the tweet - I've written over 30 & none approved 2) we probably need more than a handful of us trying to get a CN approved -- maybe 20-40?? 3) we can still be helpful in rating proposed CN's as unhelpful so as to block CN's we don't want 4) Whether I do a CN or not I often do a comment in Reply - thanks to those who helped amplify one of mine on Laura Loomer's account - now seen by over 3,000 & I engage with responders 5) Several of us like the idea of setting priorities for accounts  we will scan  e.g. those with many followers -- we've requested moderator help for working on this process 6) Seems CN's for Elon never get posted BUT BREAKING NEWS - he just deleted one of his posts!  I am attaching an earlier message. Overall am getting more pessimistic about the CN process and see progress with doing Replies. I know I'm not summarizing all the points folks have made --coffee just kicking in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1260333091319451660/1283444748824346655

Content: That's my impression after voting on 80+ CNs over the past week and looking at what gets through and what doesn't.  The pattern I've seen is that CN's only get approved on tweets that are obviously incorrect and not controversial for anyone.  For example if a photo is incorrectly labeled and a simple search proves it, it will get a CN.  A bogus account impersonating someone will get a CN.  But the most egregious stuff claiming Venezuelan gangs took over a city or Hatians are eating cats will not be approved.  Conservative users will vote against the CN as a block, so it will not get through. I'm voting on top CN's that already have enough votes to get shown to me in the "rated helpful" section, so it's not a lack of voters.  It's because the CN system is looking for notes that get people who normally disagree with each other to agree the note is worthwhile.  So a CN needs people who normally believe misinformation to cross over and agree that, in fact, this case is misinformation.  That just doesn't happen that often.  The only thing we can really hope to accomplish is to block CN's that we don't like.  How much effort is that worth?  Maybe better to direct volunteers to other projects.

Content: Thanks Peter for your points and questions. Agree that obvious fakes are most likely to get a CN approved.  So, we both think blocking CNs we don't like might be worth it. So, directing volunteers to other efforts is one way to go, or do we want MORE volunteers focused on the same CN in an attempt to get approved? Also, would like everyone to think about the possible impact of using the Reply [comment] function. The chance of Laura Loomer being affected is like [words escape me] but pro and anti-Loomers read my evidence-based info & I can test out different messaging strategies, e.g. acknowledging it's emotionally tough to change one's beliefs - strategies from deep canvassing & other psychological principles can help  [see one of my messages and follow-ups] https://x.com/BeTheLight02/status/1834354984357368298

Content: Actually, we don't need to direct people to vote on CNs for CNs we don't like to be blocked.  That's likely going to happen without our help.  And the problem here is that more volunteers doesn't necessarily get a CN published.  We'd need conservatives to vote in favor of CNs we like, not more liberals.  It's an inherently flawed system that won't allow most misinformation we care about to be flagged.

Content: Hi Peter - Am guessing you may be right - our unhelpful ratings may not be needed to block a CN -- wish we could know for sure. Needing votes from those with diverse positions can be seen as a flaw -- and also a plus as a way to get more credible notes & a check on our untended bias. Turns out there are scientific studies on millions of notes. Here is a sampling of some that could guide us. I focus here on those from last two years [or summaries in media]. A couple of studies show that between 8.5% and 12% of CNs get approved to be attached to a post. If they get attached, they have helped to counteract disinformation and misinformation, particularly around COVID-19 and vaccines - most important now with RFK jr more visible. Some positives: “X users repost content 61% less often once it receives a community note. Original posters delete their content faster once they receive a community note. Users perceive community notes as significantly more trustworthy compared to other misinformation flags.” https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/why-twitters-community-notes-feature-mostly-fails-to-combat-misinformation/

Content: Thank you <@1263626794951774320> for your guidance and deep-dive into research & resource regarding community notes. And thank you <@1061294168007258153> for your doubts about the effectiveness of CN. I have had my doubts as well but continue to rate notes when they are listed here. More importantly, and 100% with DanS regarding adding to reply/comments. I think adding to those conversations, esp. on the most toxic posts, does have impact — when we insert ourselves in those spaces to counter comments. With that said, I cherish the few of us on this channel doing this work because most folks don't have the stomach for or patience to enter these hostile conversations.

HOWEVER, there were measures I had in place which made my experience there a little less oogey.

I'm testing some of these things now to see if they still work and/or are still in development after Musk started charging for data.

"These Things" included:
- Block Lists (at one point I had 150K accounts)
- Block Chains (block account + at l.east one level of shares below that)
- VPN + MFA
- Other browser extensions

While waiting, we can uplift the notes of those that can create them as we come across them.

Content: This is circulating via DJT Jr. and Loomer this morning.
It is misleading because no one understands taxes on Social Security.
If you do not work while you are drawing SSI, YOU DO NOT PAY TAXES ON IT.
If you DO work while drawing SSI, you pay taxes on your wages.
You are only allowed to make a combined income of $24,999 and still be able to draw SSI.

So - the "Tax cut" is so small it's laughable, but it gives him the option of listing "Tax Cuts for Seniors".
Plus, if Project 2025 comes to fruition, he's gutting SSI anyway.

Content: Value of CNs - Thanks much to Liz & Peter for all your comments! I could not respond to Peter on the thread he created so here is my response:
Thanks for all your thoughts Peter! Just a quick response regarding any division between science and political disinformation -- sadly the division has been wiped away. The MI governor used science to guide her mask mandates --maga was not happy and came close to kidnapping & killing her. Tim Walz is being slammed for what he did in response to covid. On a phone call with RFK jr, Trump repeated false info on childhood vaccines recently. Disinformation on covid and vaccines generally has caused many deaths. Trump was top driver of covid disinformation in the world. Public health researchers now use political party as a main factor connected with health outcomes e.g. more have died in red counties than blues ones due to lower vaccination rates.     I have rated recent posts on myths about vaccine harms to kids & posted my messaging The bottom line -- I am almost certain the CN's on medical myths have saved lives -- so that is an area we could focus on. I shared more on this topic earlier in this channel

Content: Science Politicized - Scientific American journal endorsed Kamala and there is predictable blowback -- One NNN: "Science is, as a rule, apolitical. When politicians attack science, however, it becomes incumbent on scientists to speak their minds about that. This isn't a change in policy. It is an effort to defend the truth that science searches for, the truth that Trump attacks." One for rating -https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t/1835720861657305557

Content: Hi all! We appreciate your sustained effort to fight misinformation on Twitter. I understand it can be very frustrating to write CN's and not have them published, or feel like your vote means nothing, or even have trouble signing up for the program. If thats the case its okay if you'd like to step back from this discord chat or even twitter as a whole, completely understandable if you'd like to use your efforts elsewhere on the campaign, wherever you feel they can do more good!
This is an uphill battle for sure, and its going to take a lot, I appreciate  everyones activism and optimism! 49 days to go!

We do what we can, when we can. Flag and run larger efforts up to the campaign and party; ask for community notes and upvote on the mis/disinformation on the smaller stuff (and accounts).

Content: Any updates on this? Reading the full article makes me feel increasingly anxious. I’m eager to start sharing @harrisHQ tweets again, but I want to be prepared to respond to MAGA criticism without feeling caught off guard. With Musk’s platform leaning toward Trump supporters, I’m concerned about potential attacks around miscommunication. Also, could you clarify who runs the HQ account? Will there be any communication to volunteers or media about this situation? It would be helpful to know what we can expect moving forward.

Content: I came across the article after commenting on a Twitter post supporting a fellow Harris/Walz supporter, whose photo I had shared in our memes channel. She shared how she was getting a lot of support on Facebook, so I wanted to let her know I shared it too and mentioned @harrisHQ. Later, someone commented on the posted with a screenshot of the article, and I was genuinely surprised to realize it was real. I hadn’t heard about it before and was taken aback when I confirmed it was legitimate.

Content: KamalaHQ Account.
Hi Randy & Others – There was a discussion earlier about CNN’s Daniel Dale's fact-check of KamalaHQ. I suggest folks look over those posts. 
I first shared Dale’s article here recently, saying that I agreed with another member of this channel that some of KamalaHQ posts seem misleading, so the article validated those perceptions. I have been a follower of KamalaHQ since it began. I do not repost some posts that I assess to be misleading. 
Regarding his piece on KamalaHQ, I assessed his review of the 8 posts to be accurate.  There is a big difference between Trump saying of neo-Nazis that “nothing was done wrong” [which he did not say] versus saying there was nothing wrong with his press statement. There is a big difference between JD saying “the shoe fits” that Republicans are anti-union vs. hearing the rest of the very same sentence that the shoe fits does not apply to him or Trump. I won’t give my analysis of each one.
I also agreed that the defenses from KamalaHQ were “weak” or a “stretch.”
The only step I might suggest is to ask KamalaHQ if they are taking steps to be more accurate. 
Regarding the perception that Trump is not fact-checked, you can fact-check that easily. I gave my data on 40 fact-check articles [see doc I posted here a while ago]. Here you can some of Dale's articles that can be very useful to us https://www.cnn.com/profiles/daniel-dale  I’ve posted here the other fact-checking sources I commonly use.

Content: Hey folks, this is a copy and paste of my post on the news channel, but online there are images surfacing of a 2020 tweet from the VP about a virtual town hall meeting hosted by P. Diddy. Folks are trying to line up connections between her and the now arrested singer, but this recent tweet is a loose connection at best. https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1248624302682828802 This is referencing a virtual town hall put together by Revolt TV, where a variety of different representatives were speaking on the Coronavirus' effect in black America. This was a group event that didn't have any direct ties to anyone, it was rather just a discussion on the prior pandemic. If anyone tries to bring this tweet up, feel free to let them know about this info.

Content: Not sure if you’ve seen the latest announcement that Trump plans to charge 200% tariff of Chinese vehicles made in MX- he also said that in 2-3 years under Kamala there will be no Auto Industry in America.   If you come across posts- Here is the AP article refuting his multiple false claims regarding the Biden/Harris administration, autoworkers & auto industry

Content: In some instances and/or on other social media platforms, I have had some success with the following:

- Asking the person what Marxism is.
- Asking which policies Biden/Harris have passed and/or are proposing qualify as Marxist.
- Reminding folks we have a mixed economy (i.e. a combination of capitalism and social programs; private property and economic freedom with govt intervention to provide for the general welfare (also constitutional)).

YMMV. The first usually screens out low-info trolls and bots. The second can be a wedge and/or open up an opportunity for further discussion. The third can deepen the second and can be a tie in to further discussions on the economy, inflation, and pricing.

Content: Also noticing a change in the Twitter Algorithm too. I'm seeing less of a mix on my FYP there than last night.

Could also be that Leon's legal team is Having a Word with him regarding 1) posting AI-generated images in some states and 2) reminding him his words carry weight and are bringing trouble to his door.

Content: Noticed changes like throttling on twitter since debate….In best practices training last night Ariel said to refrain from overtly political language and keep quotes short headliners like 💯  or “yes we Kam” but calling out the issues is political?  Difficult spot to be in, will have to use misspelling and icons to get points across if necessary outside of that.  

Your recommendations  are good

Content: <@782870341445353522> Texas has removed a million people from their rolls. Oklahoma has removed hundreds of thousands. We really need a messaging campaign that tells people to check their registration status NOW & a link to a site that will guide them to fix any problems. This is a serious issue that I think we can address and I know we must.

Content: Just a note to CN contributors: I've been paying attention to rating bs partisan CNs, including ones posted by Democrats. My writing impact has risen by 10 points in less than a month, to 95%. If you're new to CNs, you might want to utilize this strategy to boost your profile rating! These are notes that aren't adding context or disputing facts. Rather, they're CNs that should be comments on the tweet. 

Just a thought. It's working for me!

Content: I would love to reach MAGA, but in my experience on Twitter, it does not matter how gently you word your post. If you are not praising the 'Dear Leader,' MAGA is not receptive, and that is usually when they start the name-calling and when I mute. They are an angry bunch.

Content: No live production is going to not have teleprompters.  They’re there to stay on the production lineup & timeline.  In case the conversation goes off track they can pick back up where they left should be.  Just because it’s there doesn’t mean it’s used.  

Even the news uses them in cameras and built into their desks .  It’s playing on public lack of industry knowledge for clickbait

Content: I’m not going to sugar coat it… it’s been a minute.  The best thing to do once you’ve been cleared to rate, is rate as many as you can I thought on 9/17 I got approved to write them but it was actually only to rate them.

Content: I have been asked to provide ratings on a number of MAGA posts and then, about a day later this  got a message that 2 of my ratings improved my score. I haven't found a way to check my score yet, though. I don't have a verified account, so that might be part of it.

Content: In re: Mr. Musk
He, like Trump, has created a platform which uplifts the worst impulses and behavior. We also know both like to "pwn the libs" "for teh lulz" to turn our functioning empathy into revenue for them. Sensationalism works.

While we cannot prevent both parties from doing what it is that they do, we can do what neither wants: Take note and/or ignore them and move on. I trust that Staff and the appropriate legal experts within the campaign and the party are also doing their part.

What we can continue to do is support each other, request community notes to those who can make them, and uplift those notes for those who can't or are awaiting approval. We can also like, share, and comment on content shared with us/among us to boost the algorithm.

Take heart. Small actions add up. We're in this together.

Content: Can't do CN's right now. Here is one message I've used that you can borrow: Right & left-leaning foundations find non-citizen voting is EXTREMELY rare. The Heritage Foundation found under 100 cases among 1 billion ballots over 20 years. Those who might vote risk everything – deportation & possible jail time because non-citizen voting is illegal https://cnn.it/3LMzuHC

Content: WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS?  Trump has learned a lot since 2020, and while neither the courts nor his Vice President delivered him the presidency in the aftermath of his election loss last time, he now has allies around the country who are scheming to ensure that it’s not.

Content: it is technically correct. however, they're intentionally not including the last year of Trump's administration, which includes a humongous drop -- March 2020 had 12,721 jobs, which then plummeted to 11,419 in April. it then jumps up to 11,982 in June, then steadily increases until it evens out during Biden's administration (October 2022 and onwards, it stays around 12,900 or so)

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP

the data they link also includes two years of Obama's administration (2014-2015) and i'm really not sure why. 

either way, Biden still ended up with more manufacturing jobs than Trump did. he even gave America _more_ manufacturing jobs post-pandemic than Trump had pre-pandemic, and has maintained that number since 2022. the person's own references don't support their claim

Content: I wouldn't be surprised their engagement is down because people can only exist in fight/flight for so long and "Concept of a Plan"/"Trust Me, Bro" is probably starting to wear thin. That and Mr. Musk got into some hot water with the FAA and the current Brazilian government last week.

What we can do is continue to uplift the posts of 1) The Campaign, 2) Down Ballot candidate races, and 3) Like/comment/share each other's posts related to this. I think <@1263626794951774320> was slicing and dicing some poll data with candidates in close races?

I know it's tough to ignore some of the larger and/or more rage-y accounts, but it is way beyond our scope to hold those folks to account.

Please continue to take breaks and regroup.

We got this and each other. 💙 😃

By uplifting those posts I just mentioned? It will also help train your algorithm to show you less of the rage-y stuff and may show you other related/more positive posts of potential volunteers.

Please share this link. https://wapo.st/4gyIsql

Content: Thank you for the gift link!

The rhetoric the Trump/Vance camp is using is as absurd as it is dangerous and there are smaller/independent outlets and journalists who 1) are (and have been) drawing parallels and 2) walking people through the 14 characteristics of fascism in their own way and in their own words.

While we can't control what major media outlets do, we can have those personal (and factual) conversations across our own networks. Think: Impact Over Reach.

Tim Snyder is one of the best I've seen at drawing those parallels and making fascism understandable. I've learned so much by following his substack. His latest is worth a read: https://substack.com/@snyder/p-149244763

The Good News: Your replies are having an impact and reached a group of folks who hadn't considered that/didn't know to consider How Live TV Is Done. Bonus: If this caused those folks a few moments of cognitive dissonance and engaged their curiosity, even better.

The Meh News: This could draw some ire and/or unwanted attention from Rage Trolls, so please do what you need to do to protect your peace.

Content: Agreed! And they are targeting all of the Harris campaign posts it seems. I feel like it needs to be kept on top of by the Harris campaign. It’s exhausting trying to keep up with all the negativity. Yesterday I had to stop with CN ratings and diverted my attention to posting on other platforms because I found myself getting angry seeing all of their CNs when they weren’t warranted, and no follow up CNs debunking their claims. I am not that good at this yet, so I don’t write a lot of notes. I really wish the campaign was monitoring the tweets they put out and adding CNs to counter the false ones.

Content: Immigration Falsehoods & Facts. Immigration is really BIG right now because Kamala just finished her speech at the southern border. MAGA pumped out falsehoods before & during her talk. I just posted 4-5 summaries of studies and reports on immigration on the online-engagement channel. Over the last couple months I have used these resources for CN's and Replies. Hope you find these resources helpful for CN's and Replies.

Content: Kamala at Border.  I posted a simple Reply ]below] on some MAGA sites last night and decided to post her entire talk -some undecideds might watch, "Kamala Harris gives solutions to fix our broken system of immigration & will get us more resources to detect & stop fentanyl smuggling. She tells how Trump blocked solutions for political reasons."

Content: Hey everyone! I’ve added some content to my Google drive on immigration that was submitted to me by a fine upstanding scholar and professor in social sciences (he wishes to remain anonymous). He did a great job; the bullet points are such that they can be easily copy/pasted. here it is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/101XsKAWexJQNjvRWRtkfhenVj_ohAydYES8yU1ngGc0/edit
I figure since immigration is such a hot topic right now, it might be of particular use!

The basis is daily Mail hs been sued and lost multiple times for fake news even by Melania… good for us… and the media bis web link ranks them as click bait also good. So I’ll get the same info over on this one too.

Content: Hey Timothy!

Not sure if this is consistent across the board, but it took ~6 hours from the time the request for a CN was made vs. when it is available to rate.

Not sure if there is some sort of threshold before a CN request is fulfilled or if there is some sort of batch process which runs on a schedule (or both?)

Would it be a useful exercise to monitor the latency?

Thanks for your insight!

Content: I had to put a community note on this… to counter theirs they are trying to separate Tom Homan as an author of PJ 2025 by using a loophole on how they listed him in the publication.  He’s listed as contributor- they are playing on public ignorance.  In the industry a contributor supplies written work, articles etc for a publication.  So he still would have supplied context and ideas even funding from the foundation to get the publication completed. 

Rating would be appreciated

Content: So the post pretty much states they are complaining about using the  theater industry for what it's for.
It's a shame they would rather complain about this instead of the blatant infringement on the rights of those actors by using AI to write endorsements on their campaign by the Trumpers.

Content: Kamala’s Digital Captain - Nevada

The Harris/Walz Campaign and Nevada Democrats seek volunteers to make phone calls and post content online to help keep Nevada Blue. Democrats won Nevada in 2016 and 2020 by less than 3 percent. This is an opportunity to significantly contribute to electing Kamala Harris as the President of the United States.

Content: be careful on your community notes.  MAGA's are ganging up and intentionally rating notes as unhelpful, when accurate fact source material is provided.  we have to be faster at rating each others notes to prevent lock outs.

Content: Could we make it easier to rate CNs by starting the post with CN TO RATE. And, for those needed, would it make sense for the person identifying the need to draft the CN needed? I try to check this channel daily. Seems like we could make it easier to get help.

Content: Do we have a process to go from CN requested to CN rating? 
Here is what I am doing:
1.  On Twitter: Request CN
2. On Twitter: Reply to post with facts
3. On Discord: Post on this channel about my CN request and my reply.

What should happen next?
1. Should others also request CN?
2. Should others like and the retweet the reply? Does that help the CN?
3. Should those who can write Community Notes, find and add CN?
4. When CN is written, should writer post on Discord for others to rate?

Content: Kamala’s Digital Captain - Nevada

The Harris/Walz Campaign and Nevada Democrats seek volunteers to make phone calls and post content online to help keep Nevada Blue. Democrats won Nevada in 2016 and 2020 by less than 3 percent. This is an opportunity to significantly contribute to electing Kamala Harris as the President of the United States.

Content: The more interaction this tweet gets, the more google will promote it. I attended a talk at a machine.ai conference years ago. A scientist from Google said that they amplify content based on the number of Likes, reads, etc. They stopped using linguistics and parsing in search engine optimization for what to promote. That is why, in 2020, people such as Larry Elder and Candace Owen had social media based outside the US and getting huge numbers of Likes as compared to the ordinary Republican Congressman. Their numbers are inflated and their pages were managed in places like Brazil.

Content: The more dangerous problem is the mainstream media's failure to amplify the accomplishments of the Biden Harris administration. On September 30, a major antipoverty program went into effect in the Biden Administration and *No News Media picked it up* - even though there were press releases from the Social Security Administration. Do major News outlets read press releases from there? Specifically, the news rules creating an expansion of SSI, the program that helps people with the most severe disabilities - and that would help a huge numbers of families - were all in effect as of September 30.  (1) More than 200 diagnoses were added to the list of those to be expedited or approved. (2) SNAP and food assistance will not be counted as income towards eligibility and benefits (3) An SSI household is redefined so that more people with disabilities who live with a non-disabled person can obtain benefits (4) They won't go back more than 5 years in evaluating work history. What a person did for a living 10 years ago won't affect eligibility for a person's disability status now. (5) SNAP and SSI are being linked in some manner.  None of this is cear. No one wrote an interpretation of how this could work for individual situations. For people lining in a group home? For married vs unmarried people in a household? What the SNAP/SSI connection means and how this applies when the rules and eligibility for SNAP vary drastically in different states.  But look what this means: In Alabama, there  is a huge population of senior citizens living at or below $100 FPL. What would this do in a state like Alamaba, or a state like PA with urban poverty, if these people could suddenly have a benefits increase up to $1971 per month. Look at how this would support permanent supportive housing for the unhoused in every state and every major city or suburb. This is *huge news* and the mainstream media completely failed to report it.

Content: Here is another positive message that isn't getting out. 1 out of every 8 women in the US get breast cancer. That's just one type of cancer. The Biden Harris Cancer Moonshot has poured research moneyh into the states. Goergia is a swing states. Georgia got a massive amount of this money. I tried to promote this information in the content teams and no one listened. How do we get the word out in Goergia about all of the money going there for cancer research. Consider the jobs it created in Georgia - all of the people who get to have a career in a subject like computer science and AI and databases matching existing cancer drug molecules to the various types of cancer that they can address.  There should be a video about this. This isn't 2020 with Trump as incumbent. Harris has a lot to brag about.  The Biden Harris White House totally rocks and people need to understand it.

Content: If they want the rural voters, that's the Christian block. The only way to break through is to remind the voters that Jesus commands them to not be afraid and to welcome the immigrants--as well as share the resources. They need to be called out and the confusion lifted.

Content: In lighter news, I heard the DEMs are trying to make some progress making revisions to the Equal Pay for Equal Work laws. Learn more here: https://19thnews.org/2024/03/equal-pay-day-white-house-gender-pay-gap/

It would be amazing if Kamala began speaking more about her plans with respect to this! 

It would be great to showcase all the things she wants to do to help women… against the 65,000+ women who were forced to bring a child to term out of rape or invest +  Trump has allegations of sexual misconduct from at least 26 women since the 1970s + Found liable for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll, resulting in a $5 million judgment, plus an additional $83.3 million for further defamation.

Then, throw in: 1 in 5 women will experience attempted or attempted rape in their lifetime; 1 in 3 will experience it between ages 11-17.
25% of women will have an abortion by age 45.

Do we really want a man with that history running this country?

There is no evidence that Kamala Harris was in a Rehabilitation facility in June of 2021 as she was working and traveling.
In June of 2021 the VP traveled to Pennsylvania, New York, DC, California, Michigan, Nevada, South Carolina, Guatemala, and Texas.

Content: We are aware that Mr. Musk often posts misleading and/or problematic content to increase engagement on his platform and in a likely effort to combat what he feels is "the woke mind virus".

What we can do is request a CN and protect our peace.

Content: Thanks. I left that platform when he took over and mostly just avoid social media altogether now, so I'm not up to date on these things. Washington Post just dropped a couple new columns about this lie, including the one I linked to, and it just infuriates me that this is happening. It's poisoning people's minds. Thank you for doing what you do to push back on this nonsense.

Content: That funding was also FROM Customs and Border Patrol TO FEMA - not actually the other way around. Just for the record. They are using an article from the Federalist titled: "Biden-Harris Admin Used FEMA Disaster Funding For Illegal Immigrants" (Cant post the link because it has a donate button) but you can google that to see it. But as you can see here (about the Shelter and Services Grant Program which they are mainly referring to): https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/frequently-asked-questions-about-shelter-and-services-grant-program that it clearly states: 

"The appropriation funds U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) with $800 million to transfer to FEMA to establish a new Shelter and Services Grant Program (SSP) to support CBP in effectively managing migrant processing and preventing the overcrowding of short-term CBP holding facilities."

So the money was ALLOCATED TO CBP and was always meant to go to CBP Programs and initiatives. It was being given FROM that budget TO the FEMA Budget so FEMA could distribute it. 

Also of note here, it leaves out that the last "stopgap bill" (Hope that is the correct term here) that the GOP House did and got approved apparently forgot to add in any money for FEMA and because the House has been unable to get through a full budget - that too would cause an issue with FEMA.

"On Monday, President Biden suggested he might need to summon lawmakers back to Washington to approve extra funding for disaster relief, after a stopgap bill for funding the government that passed last week did not provide the agency enough money to deal with multiple disasters." Gift Article Link: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/fema-funding-shortfall-hurricane-season.html?unlocked_article_code=1.PU4.SEr-.FXna4OIZ-mX8&smid=url-share) 

And also the GOP led House seems to feel there is no need to return early: [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-voted-against-fema-funding-1963980) and even [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/04/trump-fema-claim-debunked-agency-not-running-out-of-money-because-of-migrants/) has covered it really well.

Content: Okay. I think I'm getting how this works. Kind of / sort of. Are there, like, "official" corrections the campaign wants us to retweet, or are we sort of on our own? Keeping in mind that I'm brand new here, and also that I'm a practiced skeptic and absolutely won't retweet anything with which I don't confidently agree 😛

Content: no worries! so community notes are basically community members who post fact checks on tweets when they have misleading or false information. they get upvoted or downvoted based on how accurate or informative they are, and the ones that are approved are added to the tweet. but you have to sign up and go through a waiting list to be able to add them. (which is annoying, but necessary, really)

Content: No worries! Thank you for asking people to rate it. It's so frustrating how long it takes to get a note added to a post. And in the meantime, people may see it and never know it's Malarkey!

Content: 1) The CN functionality/back-end hasn't really received any development priority (or attention) since 2022
2) There is weighting and once it reaches a certain threshold it gets published.
2.5) Mr. Musk puts his fingers on those scales all the time
3) Getting access to create CNs doesn't seem to be automated and/or run; it seems like Whenever A Human Gets Around to it
4) You might get priority if Mr. Musk likes you, thinks you are notable, or a potential partner (in all senses of the word)
5) There doesn't seem to be a mechanism when CNs devolve into a flame war, other than When It Irritates Mr. Musk

I haven't seen any CNs published since I've been on this team and I suspect Mr. Musk may have turned them off/put his whole hand on the scale given the amount of mis/disinformation he spouts and/or circulates.

1) Those with the ability to create CNs please continue to request
2) Those of us who are in the queue or whose accounts don't meet the criteria, we vote on the CNs and/or comment on the post (like we have been doing)
3) We keep going. We keep fighting.

Content: As a former recruiter, I got some backstage insight on the drama that happened when it was bought... Twitter recruiters were so passionate about what they'd built and it was such a process watching what they went through. So glad most of them were recognized and ended up in good places! Such an unfortunate loss for the overall company.

Content: Thanks for the data point! This is a good thing to know.

I know requesting CNs in such hostile territory seems pointless on the surface. However, by keeping on keeping on, we're doing the following things:
- Ad hoc social penetration testing; what is getting through vs. what is getting blocked
- Exploring and mapping the contours and connections of the above, with real people, and in real time
- Improving a signal to noise ratio when we like/repost/quote/comment on campaign-approved tweets

Believe it or not, I kinda suck at math. However, I know enough to understand proving the absence of something is just as vital as proving the presence of something.

Content: Sadly I am not an academic meaning I can't explain or show examples. But basically (for me)  don't try to argue (face off) what you are hearing but rather change the direction with an alternative statement goal. There are tons of smarter people on Youtube to explain how it works.

The pattern to see a particular CN is https:/x.com/i/birdwatch/t/ + the ID of the tweet in question (that long string of numbers at the end of any tweet).

Haven't had coffee yet and my finger slipped 😅

Content: Not sure if this is the right place to suggest it. But an economic message that attacks his tariff ideas and deficit ballooning tax cuts for the rich, while painting the picture of Trump as the incumbent and Harris as the change agent:

Four more years of Trump? Inflation will go up!

Four more years of Trump?
Your interest rates are going up!

Content: I rated the note just now <@553416114823233537> , thanks ! And as a rule If you need one done ASAP plz tag me here or I can be dm'd on X at @BetoangelMommas 

With community notes, they aren't visible immediately unless you have the ability to leave or rate notes yourself
 
I would highly recommend jumping thru their hoops to EVERYONE here so you can help combat this egregious nonsense. I think it only took me a few days

Content: I am excited to see so many new folks joining the channel!

A Quick Recap of Things We Have Learned/Noticed:
- If you don't have the ability to request a CN or have a newer (e.g. less than six months old) account, you can still contribute by rating them
- If your account meets the requirements to request CNs and you decide to sign up, the period between the sign up and when access is granted will vary
- Rating notes can be done in two ways: For those of us on a tablet/laptop, we can copy-paste the string of numbers onto the end of the URI pattern: https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t + tweet ID; moving forward we will include the full URI for folks accessing CNs on mobile
- Yes. We know. Let's do what we can to keep the channel clear and focused in the days to come

Thank you and we got this!

Content: Agreed! I am finding that my posts on Twitter have more REACH, views and activity when I reply, as opposed to “quote” reposting. The last couple of days I’ve been spending a lot of time rating CN’s and posting replies to all the KH, Tim Walz and Democrats posts in “campaign social” with positive comments, memes and giphys. More people are seeing them and are reposting and liking them than quote reposting.

Content: @staff

Edited to say: 
My apologies for not putting the tag first, it's been a bit since I was here regularly.

Also, would it be possible to DM you  directly tomorrow? I believe I can help map out the disinformation network for you after 3+ yrs as a Jan 6 sedition hunter. There are multiple paid influencer networks targeting the campaign; I can  identify a number of the influencers  who met at the behest of the Trump campaign for debate war rooms. Also , which of them who've been working that were documented as being on restricted grounds J6 & as leaders for Stop the Steal.

I will gladly share photos, video, articles based upon my research but prefer to do so privately.

Content: I am working on a full debunk graphic - Not sure what to do with it when I am done though. Im a graphic artist and a gallery moderator so its been 20 years of experience "seeing small details others miss" and the obviousness of this is actually rather striking. It is definitely two different people.

Content: Guys they are so wrong about Christ, Bible and God. They know Bible and Jesus stands for care, compassion, love and unity, but they twist Bible teaching to justify their wrong doings and to fit their indoctrinated narratives! I am replying one by one to every Christian online pushing their twisted understanding of the Bible. But I want to do it more efficiently to reach all Christians.  That's why I am here but I am lost a bit, not sure how to reach the right team here.

Content: Hi Kathleen!

Community Notes (or CNs) are a way for the Twitter Community to push back on mis/disinformation. Once a tweet is flagged with a CN, we can rate it as Helpful, Somewhat Helpful, or Not Helpful.

DM me if you have any further questions. 🙂

Content: got it, checked all the boxes but "other." Yeah, I have seen oodles of people on Facebook in Michigan, Wisconsin posting/commenting about this nothingburger, fake Christian persecution story all day. I've been responding with a story about Trump's $60 Bibles made in China for $3. The perpetual grift. Thanks.

Content: There's a new version of this on X.  Not sure if it's from Trump's War Room or MSNBC.  In the new version, the quote is (paraphrasing) Vice Presidents, including Mike Pence are not critical of their Presidents.  (The "of" is soft, so I see how the Trump War Room could manipulate it.

Content: Hey there, Gabriel!

I believe anyone with a link to the CN has the ability to vote if it is Helpful, Somewhat Helpful and Not Helpful. Generally speaking, those links follow the URI pattern of https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t + the UUID of the tweet in question (usually a long string of numbers before the "?")

To be able to create CNs, Twitter does have some prerequisites and there seems to be some latency between when folks apply to be able to do so and when folks are granted the ability.

Please review the pinned information on this channel and let me know if you have any further questions!

Content: On this one, that is. Should I check any of the boxes besides just saying "not helpful?"

Content: Based on what I see on the link, X is trying to critique Kamala HQ post, and we are responding to their critique, whatever you can click to redirect readers from believing X comments, that is what we want, since we support Kamala HQ.

Content: That community note is extra obnoxious because the “source” is an X account called “Kamalalies” — blatantly biased

Content: Luddite newbie here.

Content: I looked but can’t find it on anything other than sky Australia. I can’t post CNs but voted down the final coment that she still sounded drunk in the link. If we had the real link it would help.

Content: Hey there, @Gus!

Feel free to DM me and, perhaps, we can walk through how/what to rate together?

I know it can seem like a lot at first, but once you've gone through the process a few times it'll become easier.

Also, we do offer mis/disinformation training and how to push back on it. You can sign up here:
