Some of the campaigns are replies only, FYI. If you are having difficulties with STW, please post in general-support-qs. Watch the texting campaigns channel for links and try to get into one as soon as it's posted. Thanks for being here!"

If I was not in the system because of the phone number not being validated correctly, then the system wouldn't let me in at all, correct? And thx for helping! ðŸ’™"

Maybe that's what happened? They just posted replies in texting campaigns. What happens if you click on one of those?

Please keep trying when new reply campaigns are posted. If it's still not working, ask in general-support-qs. Thanks for your persistence!"
