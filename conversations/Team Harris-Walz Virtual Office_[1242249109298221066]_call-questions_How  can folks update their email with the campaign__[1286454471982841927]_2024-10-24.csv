""Waiting on the debrief now and wanted to doublecheck with a Mod: I spoke to woman planning to attend that may have given a misspelled email address her sign-up form. Is there any way to pass along her corrected info so she can receive her RSVP email?'

I told him she could sign up again with the correct email, but I'm sure there is a better answer."
