Many volunteers change how they introduce themselves so that it works better for them."

I'm going to write that to refer to while I'm on a call. One of the things that kept me from volunteering in the past was fear that I'm not knowledgeable enough on the issues, vote history, etc. to answer questions or counter objections. I am sighed up to do this anyway because it's important, so I am setting fear aside. (First shift today.) This helps having a canned sentence ready so I won't panic, lol!)"

I've been taught never to confirm my name on a cold call and most people hung up on me the minute I asked. It seems to waste a lot of time and effort to lead off with this question.   I think you should change the script to eliminate that question and go straight to ""Hi this is..., I'm a volunteer calling about..."" Also, the options to click on once you actually talk to a person aren't that clear cut. For example if they confirm its""john and then hang up, do I click ""this isthe right person"" or do I click ""hung up."" I'll be doing phone banking again tomorrow and I'm kind of dreading this, FD"

The script does not have to be followed verbatim but we do want to get the bolded questions answered. You can change it around so it works for you.  We do want to confirm who we are talking to and mark the appropriate box.  If they hang up, then click the hang up button.  The scripts and reason for the calls change, so the script you saw may not be the same script next time. Thanks so much for joining our phone bank and hope you'll keep giving it a try!"
