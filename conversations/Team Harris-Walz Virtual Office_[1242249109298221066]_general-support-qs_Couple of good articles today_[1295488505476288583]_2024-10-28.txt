Content: There’s a couple of good news articles out there that should be talking points for surrogates and potentially ads (but I would say more interview and talking points). They especially address cost of living and inflation for any voters that think they are somehow getting 2018 prices plus also on taxes. One of the surveys comes from WSJ which is pretty conservative -

Imp points and data/research that should be cited when talking in interviews etc. (In my opinion).
