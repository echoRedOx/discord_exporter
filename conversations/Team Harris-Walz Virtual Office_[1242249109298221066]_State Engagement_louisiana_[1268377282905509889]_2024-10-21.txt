Content: I am just outside of New Orleans in Ponchatoula. I am from New Orleans and know it like the back of my hand. I have no transportation, and am a little terrified of where I live because my neighbors went outdoors to shoot fireworks and guns when Biden dropped out of the race‚Ä¶ and I found a burned cross in the woods not far from here while looking for a filming site in the woods on a friend‚Äôs property they didn‚Äôt know existed. So, I will happily canvas in NOLA‚Ä¶ where I feel much safer.

Content: Bastrop, LA here.  Voted one of the worst towns to live in.  Red as a mound of fire ants and just as unpleasant.  Feel helpless to do anything but donate money and encourage the younger folks to register and vote.

Content: i have been sending out invite links like crazy and posting on all my social media platforms. i think folks are very intimidated by discord, unfortunately. i was one of them until i took the time to join and just poke around for a while. it makes sense after a bit but at first can be very overwhelming to folks who‚Äôve never used an app like this before. but i keep trying to get folks here!

Content: There's a learning curve but it's worth taking the dive into all of these! It's making coordination so much less expensive and efficient when you get the hang of it!  It remind me of tech struggles, and eventually payoffs, of Obama's first campaign. Let's master this stuff together!

Content: We have a chance on November 5th to make sure either a Democratic candidate wins the newly formed Congressional District 6 primary outright or continues into the general election in December.   Making sure Kamala gets a majority in Congress is vitally important and this is a golden opportunity to add another Democrat to the House but I don't see much, if any, mention of the race - at least not here in northwest Louisiana.  The district lines are so bizarre, I would imagine there are thousands of people who don't even know that they are now in the new one.  Does anyone know if there are any events/opportunities to help (Cleo Field's campaign in particular)?  <:thankyou:1252806147396735057>

Content: hey just wanted to offer for a few you of talking about feeling challenged about using the Reach app... first of all, the campaign has trainings you can take - i'm signed up for one tomorrow: https://mobilize.us/s/TVZtNh. and second of all, i somehow stumbled across the Reach Knowledge Base online, and went through it all and it answered a lot of questions i had. plus there are some great videos showing what it looks like and how to use it. it's not specific to the Harris Campaign/Democrats, but it explains the actual app. https://www.reach.vote/knowledge-base/. i used this app before in 2019-20 for Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign but it's been updated with a lot more features now. it's a great tool to have!

Content: I don‚Äôt know how many of you know.. there is an app to check voter registration status and information. It is called Geaux Vote. (Louisiana only) it is an easy way to verify personal voter status to make sure it is active. It tells you how to reach your representatives (state and federal) locations of voting and how to request a mail in ballot. I have to follow up on the directions to follow up on provisional ballots, but it requires a trip to Baton Rouge. We have to let people know if they are told to fill out a provisional ballot after signing the registrar it isn‚Äôt normal. Provisional ballots are Only necessary If they cannot find your name in the book and/or something is wrong with the machines.

How do I get plugged into the strategy for Louisiana? Does the Harris Campaign have a person, or are we talking here? I would love to coordinate with folks in Shreveport and Monroe. Merci from the piney woods

Content: I'm concerned about the election for Congressional District 6.  The new map is so crazy (Shreveport is now divided into two districts) I would wager there are thousands across the state who don't even know they're in the new one.  But I'm also concerned about the lack of publicity for the Democratic candidates - particularly Cleo Fields who the state Democratic party is apparently supporting for the seat.  Has anyone in northwest Louisiana seen or heard anything?  It's vital Kamala has a Demoratic-majority Congress!

Content: Hey Paula, I‚Äôm in New Orleans but my wife went to tech so love the area up there. The Harris-Walz campaign is focused on a swing state strategy so most official efforts and investment are geared towards GA, NC, AZ, PA, MI, WI, NV. One thing I learned during Gov Edwards‚Äô reelection campaign is that so much activity is driven at the grassroots/volunteer level which is why the campaign set us up with this platform here. I‚Äôve connected with students at Tulane and have been focused on encouraging voter registration via vote.org. The great thing about vote.org is that by going to that single site, you can get registered in any state. We can encourage students from the swing states listed above (along with Florida which has a competitive Senate race) to register in their home state. Ultimately, students have the choice to register where they are residing for school or in their home state. I think that could be a great first step for the college students.

Content: Also, for anyone looking to do canvassing: while Georgia may be the closest true presidential swing state based on 2020 map, Florida has an extremely competitive U.S. Senate election that could be the tipping point for Senate majority. Pensacola has a field office and is organizing canvassing (door knocking and community mobilization), https://www.mobilize.us/2024flvictory/

Content: Thanks Nick. There is a voter registration effort at Grambling, and I don't think anything is going on at Tech, but trying to find out if it isn't too late to help. Right now we are going to work on connecting each other here, doing postcards, and encouraging people to do their own organizing through the campaign. I might still be able to do a public debate watch party, will know tonight, and then invite folks. Thanks for your reply.

Content: <@1118711294548258837> unfortunately, we can't post links to stores other than the official Harris/ Walz store. It's all part of campaign finance law. The shipping can be steep, but maybe you could get a group of friends and neighbors and place an order together to cut down on the shipping costs?

Content: <@802573110221864981> - Sorry for the delayed reply. I suggest first starting with making signs from the digital downloads section of the Kamala Harris Web Store.  https://store.kamalaharris.com/digital-downloads/.  As far as connecting with others to display them, that would be via your local Democratic Party offices. https://louisianadems.org/

Content: On this day 4 years ago, a record 3.3 million Americans cast their ballot early.  And as expected, only 1.7 million early votes have been cast (a 45% decrease).  Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/
