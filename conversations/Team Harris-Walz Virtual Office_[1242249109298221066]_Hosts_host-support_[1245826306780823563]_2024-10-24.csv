My first time posting in this group, I’m not sure if this is the appropriate place to post, please delete if not the appropriate location. 🙏🏾✨

I’m looking to host a fundraising event, in Los Angeles, and I was wondering if there are any future training sessions on what we should know, before launching said events in the community? 

Basically I’m hoping to throw an all day karaoke event, at a local restaurant that is new to the Mid-city area. 

If anyone is in the area and would like to help, please hit me up!

In the meantime I want to acknowledge that I agree with you. I want to host an event too but felt overwhelmed quickly by the process. The mods and staff come around and answer questions periodically. I have been doing getting in touch with some folks who i havent talked in a while, but I miss them. Just checking on them to see how they are doing/how they are feeling about it all so I know who is going to be all in with me and who we can convince to campaign with us. When I was campaigning for Bernie I really didnt know what to do after I hosted the event, mostly because everyone that came was not sure what they wanted to do. So think about what it is that makes you miss these folks and open your conversations honestly. I have not felt this alive in a while. I'm saying that to my friends and my family. Also knowing that not everyone is goign to be able to campaign, but maybe they can donate or should come to your watch party is you share the link to your event on your social media or text it to your friends. In my initial reach out to folks I added an invitation to this group. To some I said in case you want to get involved or I see what you are doing and we need you here too."

We are hosting a house party fundraising event and I was wondering if there was a tool kit and/or a way to set up a designated QR code or link to the donation site so that we can track how much we raise as the night progresses.  Any guidance would be helpful.

Very cool! Looks just like the regular dialer link but with some extra characters with name of your event that tie it to your event.

It can feel like a lot of steps, but it is best to work with a local office (either Dems or a candidate's). That way precincts and canvassing areas can be assigned out and they can track how much coverage they have. You can also get support and literature through them.

I made my phonebanking event public last night, and I think it's being infiltrated by people without good intentions...The main thing I noticed was that there was one email that was Aaron Imholte, aaronimholteradio@gmail.com, so I got curious. Found out he's a You Tube shock jock in Minnesota who's actually in trouble with the law for revenge porn and has a history of racist, sexist comments. I'm really worried he's going to dox us or something. Why else would he sign up from Minnesota? I made the address available only to attendees. By registering, does he now have my address? 

I realize I made a mistake by mentioning some details about our house and its history... event is here: https://events.democrats.org/event/726609/ I'm thinking I should delete the event? But also wondering if there's anything I can do to head off whatever he might be planning...thanks!"

I'm organizing a national canvass day with 15 canvasses/trips on Saturday (with Doctors for Harris and Nurses for America), all connected with local field offices.  We're going to have a Zoom with the participants tomorrow (Thursday) night.  I know every location will have training on Saturday but would love for folks to get a head start and get out to the doors as quickly as they can."

Canvassing is organized at the local level (this server is national campaign level) so you'll probably have success asking local dems offices where you'll be canvassing and coordinating with them for any tools you may need. 🙂
