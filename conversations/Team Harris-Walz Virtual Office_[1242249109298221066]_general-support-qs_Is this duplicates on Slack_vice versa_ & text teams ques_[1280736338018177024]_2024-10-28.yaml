  content: I joined slack after doing a phonebank & being given the link to join.  Was
    also given a link to join here after another phonebank I think. So are there just
    2 separate platforms used for the same things? am totally new to both platforms.
    watched some tutorials. still confusing to attempt to navigate around.  How can
    one DM a mod if needed? Do we have to add them as friends?  Also what is the difference
    bt Text Team ( what does that entail as there were tech difficulties w the text
    team training tonight & a number of us could not get in. I saw thread by a mod
    in July saying text team filled thru November. Does that mean if we join that
    we won't be texting till after election? Or has that changed & new volunteers
    would be texting soon? Thanks.

    this. I guess we don't.

  content: There are two versions of call banking. The more popular one is done in
    zoom sessions that you see announced every day in the main channels. Those phone
    banks happen completely in the zoom session, you get training, support and a community
    experience all wrapped up in one session.

  content: the other phone bank is something you do on your own time, I believe that
    uses Slack.

  content: text team is a completely different kind of experience with a different
    on-boarding. You attend a text team training and then you take a quiz, after which
    you are added to the team and they will reach out to you letting you know when
    the text banking events are. The texting activity uses the Scale to Win app.

  content: Thanks, Carolyn.  yes the phone banks I've attended have been via zoom.
    all but 1 have used scale to win. thus far.i would like to know what being on
    text team entails. is it a textbank where we text voters to ask them to support
    vp Harris? Or is it asking them to attend events? I'd like more clarity on what
    it is.  So does thst mean the call team thread on here is a duplicate of the 1
    on Slack?  How do we DM mods? when I clicked DM section it says add friends. they
    need to mail a printable version of the instructions to everyone lol. I seriously
    will need to print some of the orientation instructions.     I am having trouble
    finding my notifications. it shows I have some then I click & it's weird, it doesn't
    seem to take me to my comments directly. these sites def seem complex & imo at
    least at this point, not too user intuitive.  a quiz? you mean a quiz to determine
    if we understand the training?  Does that mean textbanking for Kamala & Tim is
    super complicated? I have LD but am doing my best to help & make a difference.

  content: "Call team on Slack is in addition to the call team here. The call team\

    \ are a red dot. You may see the red dot on the gameplayer icon (discord logo)\
