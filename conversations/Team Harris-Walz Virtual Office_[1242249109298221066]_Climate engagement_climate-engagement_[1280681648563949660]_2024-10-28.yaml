    Hi! I\u2019m in New Jersey, and I\u2019ve been volunteering for Democratic campaigns\
    \ since Dukakis/Bentsen in 1988 because I was concerned about wetlands protection\
    \ and the hole in the ozone layer. For a long time I voted in all presidential\
    \ elections but didn\u2019t pay much attention to state/local elections until\
    \ my county started a cruel and dangerous deer hunt in our county parks. I threw\
    \ myself into local politics. I now vote in every election and I\u2019m the Democratic\
    \ municipal vice chair for my town, and co-chair of our state Progressive Caucus.\
    \ Looking forward to driving over state lines to knock on doors in Pennsylvania!\u201D\
    \ I\u2019ve worked for Greenpeace, the U.S. EPA, and the Massachusetts Department\
    \ of Environmental Protection. I\u2019m vegan and I now work for Animal Protection\
    \ League of NJ. Whenever a poll asks what my number one issue is, I say climate\
    \ change."

  content: 'Hi, I''m from Massachusetts and have considered myself an environmentalist
    since high school. I''ve watched over the years as our Christmases in New England
    have gradually turned from snow and ice to rain and mud; our Octobers having more
    days that feel like July; and just last year needing to wear masks outside not
    due to covid, but to protect from inhaling wildfire smoke from the other side
    of the continent. Climate change is already impacting my own backyard as well
    as the rest of the world. Tackling this crisis is my number one priority for this
    election, one that we know Trump and his oil baron donors plan to do worse than
    nothing about. I believe there is no other choice for those of us who want a livable
    planet for ourselves and our loved ones: we must elect Kamala Harris in November
    to give ourselves a fighting chance for a sustainable future.'

    environmentalism is near and dear to me. I've done tree-planting jobs and volunteering
    in New Zealand and Iceland, as well as work on organic farms, and this summer
    I've been volunteering at the local Audubon Society center. On a more personal
    level, I've been a vegetarian for about 6 years with veganism on my to-do list,
    and try to live as car-free as possible by walking, cycling, and using public
    transportation. I know it's not much, but I hope I can help out here!

    \ and wrote to suggest no plastic. There was supposed to be a ban but it never\
    \ happened though some of the stores have. Biden has been amazing on the climate\

    \ District and are seeking to raise campaign funds and awareness by donating a\
    \ T-Shirt Design to help  elect  Vice President Harris as President. What is the\
    \ process to submit our designs and to produce them locally by an affiliated Union\
    \ Print Shop? \nWe have already emailed the official campaign website accordingly.\
    \  We have shared the design concept with key people who are ready to place orders\
    \ and raise funds. \nWould like to set this up, so merchandise and proceeds go\
    \ to the appropriate channels for distribution and allocation.  it would be amazing\
    \ to include this design once approved to the official campaign merch online shop.\
    \  Please contact us accordingly.  Thank-you."

  content: Hi everyone! Combatting climate change is especially meaningful to me as
    a hiker, birder, animal enthusiast, and general nature and outdoors lover. I am
    currently in Massachusetts, where I thought I would at least be safe from the
    wildfire smoke and heat that I was used to after living in California for 8 years.
    Not so. This summer, we had at least 3 or 4 full weeks where it was impossible
    to do any activities outside due to extreme heat or bad air quality from Canadian
    wildfires. Additionally, worsening hurricane seasons mean more and more heavy
    surf and beach erosion at my favorite beaches, and fewer resting areas for migrating
    shorebirds. And of course now, we have a worsening influx of mosquito-bourne viruses
    in the state including EEE and West Nile---and as someone with preexisting health
    conditions, I am now still hesitant to spend much time outdoors even as we enter
    the fall. I look forward to engaging with all of you so we can get Kamala and
    Tim elected and protect our environment!

  content: Hello! I'm a sixth generation Kansas farmer (claiming the title even if
    I don't spend much time on a tractor). My dad noted climate change decades before
    he passed in 2008. Last year was horrid. August monthly average temps were 4.47
    degrees above normal. Our crops depleted the soil moisture to eke out a tiny crop.
    My cousins (guys in their 40s who actually drive the tractors) are probably the
    last of our family to farm. We have a wealth of wisdom in our family farm operators
    when it comes to conserving natural resources, but family farms are dying thanks
    to federal policies that favor corporate farms. We can and must do better.  P.S.
    My family's farmers are all Dems. I didn't know there was such a thing as a Republican
    farmer until I first ran for office in 2006.

    about 20 years now and the momentum that Biden-Harris have brought to this issue
    through IRA, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and other efforts are out of the park
    exciting and what practitioners - and the planet - have been waiting for. Especially
    given the tough political climate in which they had to act.


    I am so excited and hopeful for more federal leadership on incentives for renewable
    energy, rail, environmental justice, climate adaptation and more. States and municipalities
    can do ok, but some will and others won''t - and they lack the scale that''s really
    needed for these complicated, interconnected, massive challenges.'

  content: "A big question is what she *can* do in the wake of SCOTUS's overturning\
    \ of Chevron deference (and various federal regulations) in the past couple of\
    \ years. It's why we also need a Dem House, so they can pass legislation to fill\
    \ in major gaps and try to buy back progress that was made but then shut down\
    \ by one federal court or another. If he wants to preserve the environment, he\
    \ needs to support candidates who's going to address current issues in the judiciary.\
    \ I'm not elated with her position on fracking but I also understand it from a\
    \ political POV\u2014she needs to win PA to be able to win the election and my\
    \ guess is she'll strive to work with industry on some kind of incremental shift\
    \ away from it if she wins. PA is registering more new Rep voters right now than\
    \ Dem voters. It's tricky."

    should vote for Harris. If Trump wins he will most likely have a GOP Congress
    that is promising to repeal it. Even with Democrat control of both chambers Trump
    can still stop most of it

  content: United States enjoys 24 hour energy usage in terms of electricity and water.
    It is one of the few countries with this advantage. if we wish to continue to
    enjoy such a privelege we need to take action to reduce our energy costs in each
    home  by promoting reduction in use such as turning off lights when not in use,
    storing water on site such as rain water for irrigation needs at home, adding
    green energy support items such as solar panels etc. By reducing energy consumption,
    we can each help with reduction in energy needed. this will help us to look more
    into options of generating more energy through wind turbines as our energy consumption
    reduction, may be used to start the wind turbines, and capture more clean energy.

  content: 'BITD: I interned with the Airspace Systems Project at NASA and some of
    things the program was researching had to do with weather, air traffic, and fuel
    efficiency.


    Think: Near real-time updates so pilots could find the fastest and safest way
    through storms and efficiently routing flights from gate to gate.


    Not sure how much of that got into any current systems, but from air traffic control
    to farmer''s reports, eliminating and/or privatizing weather data is a terrible
    idea.'

    \ and his former Chief of Staff were involved in creation of it):     \n\n\u25A1\
    \ Elimination of Climate Change References: Advises eradicating climate change\
    \ references in government.\n\n\u25A1 Environmental Agencies: Proposes downsizing\
    \ the EPA and abolishing NOAA.\n\n\u25A1 Emissions Regulations: Suggests relaxing\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions regulations and preventing states from implementing\
    \ stricter vehicular emissions standards.\n\u25A1 Fossil Fuels: Encourages increased\
    \ fossil fuel production and opposes renewable energy expansion.\n\u25A1 Repeals:\
    \ Plans to repeal climate-related legislations like the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\
    \nReduction or Elimination of Renewable Energy Subsidies: Project 2025 promotes\
    \ a shift away from government incentives for renewable energy development.\n\n\
    Government Overhaul: Proposes significant restructuring of federal agencies, advocating\
    \ for direct presidential control over the federal bureaucracy, including job\
    \ protections removal for thousands of government employees.\n\nThe initiative\
    \ includes firing over 50,000 federal employees and replacing them with individuals\
    \ loyal to Trump\u2019s vision, effectively transforming civil service positions\
    \ into political appointments through the reinstatement of the \"Schedule F\"\
    \ executive order.\n\nThis plan aims to eliminate civil service protections, allowing\
    \ for the reclassification of federal workers as political appointees. The proposal\
    \ also involves dismantling or downsizing various federal agencies, such as the\
    \ Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, and reallocating\
    \ their functions to other departments or eliminating them entirely.\n\nThe overarching\
    \ goal of Project 2025 is to reshape the federal government to be more responsive\
    \ to the president's directives, potentially eroding checks and balances and altering\
    \ the nonpartisan nature of the civil service."

    - 9 pm EST is a little late to be calling in that time zone, but of course, you
    can call the West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii until 9 pm local time.  Perhaps it's

    to share a screenshot of it, if you can crop off the donate button, or just describe
    how other volunteers can find it. Unfortunately that donate button means we need
    to apply our "no fundraising" rule and remove it.

  content: The Inflation Reduction Act was passed through a compromise that allowed
    some incentives for fossil fuel projects. The incentives for clean energy are
    larger and out-weigh the dirty energy. Putting bans on things is political suicide.
    So if there can be a phase out through investment and innovation, that would be
    great. We will have to stop drilling and burning though but getting Harris into
    office and then having that conversation will be better than the alternative.

  content: 'That does not address the climate crisis. This is more of a systemic problem
    however. Further that is the backward looking strategy this is about what she
    does once she is in office. This is not about undermining Harris but more focused
    on saying if they answer those questions they would be able to slam dunk the election.
    For example you have today Harris: We need to do something about the climate crisis
    vs Trump: How do you do it without raising taxes drill baby drill. In contrast
    it could be Harris: If we can use Green energy to fund UBI, eliminate income taxes
    for middle and lower incomes, and fix healthcare but you can only do it through
    green energy. Trump: They''re eating their CAAAAATS!!!'

  content: People assume nothing gets done in DC because they have heard the same
    future faking for decades. I did not say Harris is the same old thing my being
    here says otherwise. I am saying your response is the same old thing. If you do
    voter outreach responses of "Actually" followed by the willful dismissal of observable
    fact is more of the same. I am not saying you dont know any policy I am saying
    you dont know enough policy or its history to understand how "We can discuss that
    after the election" is just more of the Clintonian "Its the economy stupid" that
    gave cover for nakedly neoliberal trickledown eonomic policies that make the Democratic
    party the party of the condenscending elite in the eyes of rural voters. If we
    want to move rural areas from red to blue we need to be able to answer their concerns
    BEFORE the election not after. After all as we are constantly reminded every day
    "Democracy is at stake" so if there was ever a time to speak to rural and older
    generations problems the arguement you use with young will not play with the old.

    but you can take any issue in the list on the issues page and extrapolate a tie
    in to the environment or climate change.  https://kamalaharris.com/issues/.  Thanks

  content: Where I am in Tennessee, many people are realizing that the climate crisis
    will not spare us simply for being 500+ miles inland. Yesterday, I was running
    deliveries of water and groceries down the road, to towns where every bridge over
    the Nolichucky is gone, entire livelihoods gone, and even lives lost. This is
    a key opportunity for us to focus on what Harris and Walz will do to course-correct
    and protect our communities and our ecosystems, and to reverse the effects of
    climate change. Ideally, we would have a one-page infographic that addresses the
    devastation down here, the basics of climate change, and what the Harris-Walz
    administration will do to address these issues. This would allow us to connect
    with our community over this crisis and use it to create real, lasting change.

  content: Fully agreed. Our governor, Bill Lee, did not declare a state of emergency
    until after the damage was done. There are towns down the road from here that
    are virtually wiped off the map. There is a lot of criticism of the government
    response here, and a clear message from the Harris-Walz campaign would be influential.

    But the Harris campaign really ought to continue trying to engage on this. All
    the young adults I know are upset by the perceived relative lack of attention
    -- doesn't mean necessarily that they won't vote (most are aware of the importance)
    , but it's difficult to connect with them on the issue.

    \ \n\nI participate with several Florida groups:  FL Victory 2024, Orange County\
    \ Dems, Florida Women for Harris, and more.   And blue Florida has been working\
    \ its a$$ off to get our state, and the country, the electoral votes and the blue\
    \ wave that the Harris/Walz team needs.  \U0001F30A In some cases, people are\
    \ putting themselves at personal risk to do this, because you know how it can\
    \ be putting yourself out there publicly in deep red territory.  (Or you can imagine).\
    \  And these folks are doing it ALL!  Canvassing, sign waving, postcarding, house\
    \ parties, information tables, post-its on restroom doors, and more.  We\u2019\
    re out there for education and equality and the climate and reproductive rights\
    \ every single day.   And you want to talk phone banking?  Florida has had its\
    \ own equivalent of Dawn to Dusk Dialing for MONTHS, and I get sent new dialer\
    \ links almost daily because of all the good folks hammering through those lists\
    \ like nobody\u2019s business.  \n\nBut Florida is still recovering from Helene\
    \ and now Milton is on its way.  I\u2019m typing this now from an area predicted\
    \ to be in the direct path (but not under evacuation orders, because we obey those\
    \ and we listen to facts, not nonsense).  People are doing their best but they\
    \ are scared.  We don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming.  And in addition to whatever\
    \ we face, we may lose power for days or weeks in the tropical heat, and that\u2019\
    s no joke.\n\nThat means the campaign work in Florida has to be put on hold while\
    \ we deal with survival.  \n\nSo, please, if you\u2019re grateful to have a roof\
    \ over your head and chilled food in the refrigerator and a grocery store that\u2019\
    s stocked and power for your devices, take a few extra minutes in the next few\
    \ days and make some extra calls.  Make up the slack for what Florida wants to\
    \ do and can\u2019t.  \n\nAnd we\u2019ll be right back in there to help as soon\
    \ as we\u2019re on our feet again.  Because that\u2019s what we do for each other\
    \ in a world that cares.  Thank you!"

  content: Yes the infrastructure of campaign work - the relationships, the training,
    the tools, for phone banking and canvassing and rallies and GOTV - is the same
    infrastructure needed for disaster recovery. Let's keep everyone safe and connected

  content: "I wanted to share this latest article from The NY Times talking about\
    \ how Trump rolled back climate resiliency across the U.S. states, so everyone\
    \ understands what is on the line: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/climate/trump-flood-protection-rules-infrastructure.html\n\
    \nAlso remember, he wants to get rid of FEMA, delete any reference to \u201Cclimate\
    \ change\u201D in all gov\u2019t docs, exit the Paris Agreement, UNFCC, World\
    \ Bank, IMF, immediately repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and substantially\
    \ increase Int\u2019l tariffs, potentially setting off trade wars with others,\
    \ including China. \n\nIf you want to understand how bad our country currently\
    \ is in protecting us against climate change because of all the lobbying and what\
    \ cities face the biggest risk, check out FEMA\u2019s building resilience tracker:\
    \ https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/building-science/bcat.\n\
    \nWe cannot afford to roll back climate resilience regulations/standards in the\
    \ various U.S. cities or states. It\u2019s proven GOP led states and cities use\
    \ older codes. We need as many of them using the latest 2024 building code, energy\
    \ code and green construction code possible. We need the cities engineered to\
    \ withstand the latest risk called out in the most up to date climate risk maps\
    \ from NOAA, NASA, Berkeley Earth. \n\nAllowing us to build cities to outdated\
    \ codes and outdated climate risk maps (flooding, fire, drought/heat, intensifying\
    \ storms and sea level rise) will compromise our ability to save lives and limit\
    \ the destruction. \n\nThere are three justices in their 70\u2019s with two likely\
    \ to retire in the next election. We cannot have the GOP have more control of\
    \ the Supreme Court as we argue about who is to blame, who needs to pay, and what\
    \ happens with water rights. \n\nThe extreme heat will bring droughts and cause\
    \ water/food shortages and cripple our electricity grids (A/C demand). We need\
    \ control of the House, Senate and Presidency!\n\nWe also need to ensure the voters\
    \ also focus on the judges in their areas!"

    \ grown men turn away in fear. They speak of it only vaguely, if at all, tiptoeing\
    \ around anything that sounds too gloomy or doomy or alarming.\n\nLook, it\u2019\
    s no secret why Donald maintains an outdated dirty energy policy, and it\u2019\
    s not because he actually believes that pouring gas on a planet on fire is going\
    \ to do any good. No, Donald made a deal with the devil. The man is so soaked\
    \ in oil money his climate plan is drill baby drill. You hear it at every rally\
    \ - \"drill baby drill.\" Where is he drilling? Graveyards.\n\nYou know, things\
    \ rarely work out well for graverobbers. The carcasses they call \u201Cfossil\
    \ fuels\u201D serve a purpose: they keep carbon out of the air so the planet remains\
    \ stable. That's our carbon vault. Eons in the making, this natural wonder brought\
    \ us the world we know and love, that farmers know and love, because agriculture\
    \ requires a stable climate with predictable weather patterns. Farmers need to\
    \ know when to plant their crops, when to harvest, when to expect rain and sunshine\
    \ and tolerable temperatures. Given what we stand to lose, perhaps we ought to\
    \ keep it as the lord intended.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to take a stable climate, and\
    \ the agriculture it enables, for granted. It\u2019s the kind of thing you don\u2019\
    t notice till it\u2019s gone. Look, I\u2019ll level with you - fossil fuels are\
    \ bad for farmers, and what\u2019s bad for farmers is bad for everyone who needs\
    \ to eat to stay alive."

  content: "The Fossil Fuel Ghoul - I mean, industry - has certainly been busy. A\
    \ hundred years of setting fire to the planet\u2019s carbon vault has left an\
    \ enormous cloud of corpses hanging in the sky. It\u2019s disgusting. I mean,\
    \ come on, fossil fuels are bodies we burn and breathe. I don't know about you,\
    \ but I\u2019d rather not fill my lungs with ancient corpse soup coughed up from\
    \ hell.\n\nFortunately we no longer have to. With clean energy on the table, Donald's\
    \ dirty energy policy is an odd choice. I've got news for you buddy: we don't\
    \ need to do that anymore. We have the technology to bottle sunshine, a gust of\
    \ wind, a wave in motion. What use do we have for the barbaric practice of burning\
    \ bodies for energy?\n\nEnergy systems have their youth and their age. Sure, fossil\
    \ fuels brought us the advances of the past century, but they can carry us no\
    \ further. I mean, an infant is well served by diapers - that doesn\u2019t mean\
    \ the child ought to stay in them forever. Old technology is replaced by the new.\
    \ It\u2019s the way of the world.\n\nStill, old Donald knows his keeper, he knows\
    \ his role: a geriatric candidate peddling a geriatric fuel. His climate plan\
    \ is clear: let it burn. He goes even further, insulting America, telling her\
    \ she is too weak to lead the world in this energy crisis, too weak to use clean\
    \ energy technology she already has - technology she invented, tools she built.\
    \ When will she be stronger? Will it be next week or in the next decade? Opportunity\
    \ is here now, clear and shining. Powerful and offensive actions can and must\
    \ be taken. The policy we offer is simple and straightforward: we\u2019ve got\
    \ the tools - we\u2019re going to use them.\n\nWe're not going back. We're not\
    \ going back to archaic fuels and we're not going back to a time before stability,\
    \ a time before agriculture. Because when the world is under attack, we fight\
    \ back. That\u2019s who we are as Americans - we fight back. And when we fight?\
