Content: I have about 50-60 households willing to put up signs in their yard, but practically none of them will spend $20. I also have a sign making company I can use to make bulk quantities, but I would like to use official graphics (18' X 24") with the recently updated font and that brilliant blue. I can't seem to find a website or person who can provide me with the art file that I can use with the printer.   I am willing to pay about $365 for 50 signs with wire stands to give signs to those voters. All I need is the official graphics. Otherwise, I have to create my own unofficial graphics. Here are low-res photos of official signs, although I'd prefer to use the brighter brilliant blue if possible. Can anybody point me to somebody in the campaign who has the art files for these signs?

Content: Hi <@1277407870010527850> this is very generous of you! You might try going to the Reach library and searching "sign" it will give you a lot of sign images that were made for social media use. One of those (might need cropping) but could be better than a low res photo.

Content: It is the same low-res photo that I already pulled from Kamala's main website. It seems that somebody in the campaign would know ehere to get the orginal art file.

Content: I think the problem is, the campaign legally needs to pay for the printing of official signs and also receive funds from sale of official signs. So they aren't going to be supportive of you getting the signs printed elsewhere.

Content: Carolyn, that's very interesting, but that doesn't seem right. As a non-employee (I am a volunteer), I am spending my time and money (by working fewer hours at my job) so that I can spread messages, memes, graphics and articles across my 15+ social media groups as part of the online engagement team. So how is that different from me paying for my own physical signs to give to voters who are willing to put the signs in their yards? In fact, isn't it my First Amendment right to use my own resources (time and money) to make signs or my own voice to promote anybody or anything I want? No campaign money is involved; just my money and time. Is there any kind of org chart for the entire campaign organization so I can find a legal dept person to make sure I am not violating any campaign laws by making my own unofficial signs (with a note saying something like  "Privately funded by Joe Carr, not provided by the Harris Walz campaign"). Also, if there is a campaign org chart, is there a group that deals with the production and sale of merchandise and signs? Maybe they could help me. Thank you for your replies!!

Content: I didn't explain very well. You can definitely make your own non-official signs, please do that. I was trying to explain why you can't get the official image files and print those yourself, also those official image files would have "paid for by HFP"

Content: It is confusing since volunteers are using official campaign materials in their social media, somehow there is a difference between digital media and printed material.

Content: Here you go Joe, have your printer adjust the blue to the color you are looking for. Image is 24" x 18" (7200 pixels x 5400 pixels, just convert it from 72ppi to 300ppi). From the campaign's web site.

Content: Tim, the images you provided for sign printing clearly state "Paid for by Harris Victory Fund". This is official campaign material, and printing them without having paid for them has the potential to be a legal nightmare for all parties involved given copyright law and intellectual property rules. You are free to use unofficial material you find on Reach, or even design your own, but these can not be used as they are. I'm going to go ahead and delete the images. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Content: It's called the Harris-Walz Yard Signs - Digital Downloads. It's for people who want to print their own yard signs. Certainly you cannot print these and then sell them, but that's not what I thought Joe was trying to do.

Content: I see. The digital download is a new option, first time I've seen it, but still I think it needs to be 8.5x11 original size.

Content: So, and there's the crux. The provided free size is what was put out by the campaign for free use. Altering and then providing the altered product is not.
