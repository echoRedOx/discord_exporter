    Discord. I can''t seem to find it now. Could someone reach out to let me know
    what kind of help you need and what the time commitment is?


    I have experience organizing volunteers, phone banking and text banking. After
    making the switch from Slack over to Discord I feel like I can navigate it well
    now.'

  content: H Laura, I really appreciate you reaching out and sharing more about your
    background and engagement. As the server gets bigger and bigger we will be brining
    more moderators onto the team. One of the best ways to "apply" is to share helpful
    suggestions that are supportive of new volunteers in the https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1242249109298221069
    and other channels.
