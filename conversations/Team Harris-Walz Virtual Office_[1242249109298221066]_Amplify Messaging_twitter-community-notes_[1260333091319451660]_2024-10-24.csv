Reviewing over 65,000 notes on COVID-19, nearly half of them cited high-authority sources and 44% cited moderately trustworthy sources. 
While X/Twitter says that community notes are not effective at dispelling all instances of misinformation, it has shown a positive impact in these ways:
X users repost content 61% less often once it receives a community note.
Original posters delete their content faster once they receive a community note.
Users perceive community notes as significantly more trustworthy compared to other misinformation flags.
However, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that community notes are a lagging indicator. These notes apply to posts that have already been seen by the public. If posts contain misinformation or disinformation, some damage has already been done by the time the post receives a community note."" https://www.meltwater.com/en/blog/twitter-community-notes"

I will look in real-time for video clips on Elon's account, RNC Research, MAGA War Room & others. For responding, I am preparing or recycling community notes in areas where Musk & Trump align in bashing: trans rights, DEI, immigrants, mainstream media, etc. I will post draft community notes in a document here before the interview. I can only post one CN a day so you are welcome to borrow some of mine if you want to join in this effort. I'll focus on responses to immigration falsehoods.

I hope some talking points can be developed "" I did a search. MANY right-wing outlets reported on the supposed ties 3 days ago, e.g. Fox News https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-walz-ties-muslim-cleric-antisemitic-views-gave-state-funding-group-report Does not look like the ties are very direct.

Walz supported the Muslim community in many ways https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2024/08/06/five-faith-facts-tim-walz-lutheran-248512 Perhaps someone can create a message about the true nature of the ties -- Walz did not support any anti-Semitic views."""

I am not a staff or a moderator, but I will share my process. I have done community notes for about 2 months & on this channel for about 3 weeks.  As HorribleRyan [I bet you're not so horrible] said, we scroll through this channel for requests to help with a tweet. In addition, I scan for posts on X-twitter with community notes that can be rated or where I can add a comm. note. I focus on very recent posts on right-wing sites like RNC Research, MAGA War Room, Heritage Foundation, End Wokeness, and others.  I also look at the new notes in the Community Notes section https://x.com/i/communitynotes/new . I use fact-checking sites & articles. Attached is my latest list."

These folks have secretaries and staffers who filter through communications (and flag anything and report it if it‚Äôs harmful) and only give them pertinent comms. I say this only because my day job is a public defender so I know just *tiny bit* about how a DA office operates. Due to the lack of citizen knowledge on judicial processes, ethics, and laws‚Äîit makes our jobs extremely difficult and we get labeled as liars or trying to ‚Äúhide the truth.‚Äù 

Specifically, the priest who claims he was abused as a child by another priest was seeking to obtain records held by her DA office, in order to release the names of alleged perpetrators. Those records did not contain his own information however, so he was seeking to release information about other victims. 

Because there could have been an ongoing investigation and victims of SA have anonymity by law‚Äîshe couldn‚Äôt have released those records regardless. It would have been in violation of the Victims Rights Act."

Fighting to Set Murderers Free
Kamala Harris supported the Minnesota Freedom Fund, helping to bail out now-convicted murderers and violent criminals. One man freed by the bail fund went on to commit murder. She‚Äôll bring the MFF‚Äôs policies to the White House.

Harris's Positions

Kamala Harris actively supports bailing violent criminals out of jail and allowing violent illegal aliens to roam our streets.

Case in point: Kamala Harris called on her supporters to ‚Äúchip in‚Äù to the Minnesota Freedom Fund.

According to new reporting from CNN, that fund went on to bail out at least 65 people in a single county accused of ‚Äúfelony charges involving violence, physical threats or sex crimes. All were convicted.‚Äù

The MFF paid bail for looters arrested in the 2020 riots, for a twice-convicted rapist, a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, a man accused of a vicious assault and robbery, a man charged with attacking a woman in a restaurant bathroom, and even several serial domestic abusers ‚Äî among dozens of other criminals.

That makes sense considering Kamala Harris supports ending cash bail ‚Äî even for violent criminals."

What makes this one tricky for me to rate is there is no definitive source of proof one way or the other.  It seems to me that if there is ""evidence"" that this video is a set-up, it would be the fact that there is a picture of the girl's injuries in addition to the video of the supposed assault in the same post, literally uploaded together at the same time.  

Would an assailant ever ask their victim to pose for a close-up picture of their injuries after they've assaulted them?  It seems even less likely that the victim would agree and actually pose for the picture, but that is what we are essentially being asked to believe based on this post. It seems most logical that if this were a real incident, the video would be uploaded by the perpetrator on their social media account, and the picture of the victim's injuries after the assault would be posted later by the victim on their social media account, once they are out of harms way.  The video and picture being present in the same post is fair evidence that this was a set-up.

If anyone would like to make another CN based on this point please feel free to do so.  This is the type of post where there may not be a way to prove or disprove definitively, but presenting a logical argument is the best that can be done until  law enforcement does an actual investigation.  Thanks everyone!"

My guiding principle: THE MAGAe are lost to America. We're not dumbf**k whisperers. Use CN for its stated purpose and confine political arguments to replies or quote tweets.

I think we could be more effective if we set some priorities for which posts are most important [am guessing at any one time there are hundreds of CN's to rate]-- so some group discussion might be good. 2-3 times, I sent out my priorities and strategies, recently for Izzy, where I said: I routinely try to 1) look at right-wing accounts with large audiences: End Wokeness, MAGA War Room, RNC Research, Trump War Room, Collin Rugg, Heritage Foundation [Elon Musk - see article I posted earlier today 2) recent posts, usually up to 3-4 days old.  I also look at new posts at https://x.com/i/communitynotes/new   I may leave a comment if I can't add a community note because I only get to post one CN a day  To get facts, try a google search that starts ""fact check"" & also look at sites like Politifact, Factcheck.org, Snopes, & Kessler at Wash Post.""

These are perfect examples of what the CN framework is not meant for. Ultimately, CNs that are partisan or use biased language or don't have cites and those that receive ""Not Helpful"" status will harm the reach, impact and ratings of the person who posts them. 

I do agree we need a moderator in this thread to provide some guidance along with maybe four or five regular users to scan for posts that **do** qualify for CNs. I would be happy to help in any way I can be useful. 

I think your approach, Dan, is really good and could be utilized by all of the CN volunteers here.

I think we are underutilizing this program on Twitter and with some concentrated attention we could make a difference and reach some of the persuasable lurkers out there.

Good point about ""Not Helpful"" ratings likely to harm the impact of the person who posts [not sure what CN I might have posted]. Good idea to have several of us scanning certain accounts -- I have done this to find posts on the accounts I listed earlier that often reach millions. We can have the most impact with new posts. We could divide up this task. Yes, I do believe there are persuadable voters out there. I will be turning more to using ""Response"" postings than CN postings. A response on Trump's account has reached 15K with 300 reposts -- maybe then reaching persuadable?  I'm guessing that to get a CN approved for attachment to a post, it takes 20-40 helpful responses with low or no unhelpful ratings?? I think to have an impact we need more than a handful of us doing ratings. I might encourage some online-engagement folks to join us - Dan"

Hey gang, I just posted the message below on Twitter. 
Share if you like.

---------------
It is the job of those of us who pay close attention to news and politics to TRY to educate those who do not.
Those who watch or read news only from their echo chambers are already lost. 
But there are still  undecided voters. Help them make the best choice! 
How? Please, folks..

- send a link to the complete debate last night to ANYone you know will be voting, especially if you know they are 'undecided! Send it to everyone you know who says they aren't voting because ""...there's no good choice""
...and ask THEM to share it.
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-harris-and-trump-debate-pbs-news-simulcast-of-abcs-2024-presidential-debate
Only ONE candidate on the stage in this debate was intelligent, prepared, self-controlled.
Only ONE candidate passes the Commander in Chief test. 
Anyone who watched should be able to see which one. I don't even need to name HER. 
SHE will be a president for ALL Americans.

Over the last year, I, along with progressive & liberal friends, have come close to leaving X-twitter. Studies show it‚Äôs become more right-leaning in the last 2 years. Still, some big influencers stay there: Barack Obama has almost as many followers as Elon [And Taylor Swift is still there too}   ].

HOWEVER, this is likely why we are focusing our efforts on turning down the noise and/or volume, providing factual sources, and reporting what we find. By doing so, we are providing important data to the campaign and folks who can compare and contrast what they are noticing among other channels.

Take heart (and take breaks!). The volume (in terms of mass, how ""loud"" the voices are, and who is amplifying) is meant to be exhausting and scary. The goals of this BS is to:

1) Keep people from voting. Schools, churches, and community centers are often the places people go to cast their ballots.

- Audits showed any fraud was negligible.
- Some states allow undocumented folks to vote in state and local elections, which makes sense because those will have more of an impact on where they live and work. We cannot know someone's immigration status just by looking at them.
- People/groups of people settle out of court either to save time, court resources, or because doing so may be less expensive in the long run.
- Districts and election offices across the nation have stepped up their game to ensure the security of our elections moving forward."

long story short: Big Business decided the best business practice was to charge more because no one has room to complain.

The pattern I've seen is that CN's only get approved on tweets that are obviously incorrect and not controversial for anyone.  For example if a photo is incorrectly labeled and a simple search proves it, it will get a CN.  A bogus account impersonating someone will get a CN.  But the most egregious stuff claiming Venezuelan gangs took over a city or Hatians are eating cats will not be approved.  Conservative users will vote against the CN as a block, so it will not get through. I'm voting on top CN's that already have enough votes to get shown to me in the ""rated helpful"" section, so it's not a lack of voters.  It's because the CN system is looking for notes that get people who normally disagree with each other to agree the note is worthwhile.  So a CN needs people who normally believe misinformation to cross over and agree that, in fact, this case is misinformation.  That just doesn't happen that often.  The only thing we can really hope to accomplish is to block CN's that we don't like.  How much effort is that worth?  Maybe better to direct volunteers to other projects."

Agree that obvious fakes are most likely to get a CN approved.  So, we both think blocking CNs we don't like might be worth it. So, directing volunteers to other efforts is one way to go, or do we want MORE volunteers focused on the same CN in an attempt to get approved? Also, would like everyone to think about the possible impact of using the Reply [comment] function. The chance of Laura Loomer being affected is like [words escape me] but pro and anti-Loomers read my evidence-based info & I can test out different messaging strategies, e.g. acknowledging it's emotionally tough to change one's beliefs - strategies from deep canvassing & other psychological principles can help  [see one of my messages and follow-ups] https://x.com/BeTheLight02/status/1834354984357368298"

That's likely going to happen without our help.  And the problem here is that more volunteers doesn't necessarily get a CN published.  We'd need conservatives to vote in favor of CNs we like, not more liberals.  It's an inherently flawed system that won't allow most misinformation we care about to be flagged."

Needing votes from those with diverse positions can be seen as a flaw -- and also a plus as a way to get more credible notes & a check on our untended bias. Turns out there are scientific studies on millions of notes. Here is a sampling of some that could guide us. I focus here on those from last two years [or summaries in media]. A couple of studies show that between 8.5% and 12% of CNs get approved to be attached to a post. If they get attached, they have helped to counteract disinformation and misinformation, particularly around COVID-19 and vaccines - most important now with RFK jr more visible. Some positives: ‚ÄúX users repost content 61% less often once it receives a community note. Original posters delete their content faster once they receive a community note. Users perceive community notes as significantly more trustworthy compared to other misinformation flags.‚Äù https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/why-twitters-community-notes-feature-mostly-fails-to-combat-misinformation/

It is misleading because no one understands taxes on Social Security.
If you do not work while you are drawing SSI, YOU DO NOT PAY TAXES ON IT.
If you DO work while drawing SSI, you pay taxes on your wages.
You are only allowed to make a combined income of $24,999 and still be able to draw SSI.

So - the ""Tax cut"" is so small it's laughable, but it gives him the option of listing ""Tax Cuts for Seniors"".

Thanks for all your thoughts Peter! Just a quick response regarding any division between science and political disinformation -- sadly the division has been wiped away. The MI governor used science to guide her mask mandates --maga was not happy and came close to kidnapping & killing her. Tim Walz is being slammed for what he did in response to covid. On a phone call with RFK jr, Trump repeated false info on childhood vaccines recently. Disinformation on covid and vaccines generally has caused many deaths. Trump was top driver of covid disinformation in the world. Public health researchers now use political party as a main factor connected with health outcomes e.g. more have died in red counties than blues ones due to lower vaccination rates.     I have rated recent posts on myths about vaccine harms to kids & posted my messaging The bottom line -- I am almost certain the CN's on medical myths have saved lives -- so that is an area we could focus on.

Hi Randy & Others ‚Äì There was a discussion earlier about CNN‚Äôs Daniel Dale's fact-check of KamalaHQ. I suggest folks look over those posts. 
I first shared Dale‚Äôs article here recently, saying that I agreed with another member of this channel that some of KamalaHQ posts seem misleading, so the article validated those perceptions. I have been a follower of KamalaHQ since it began. I do not repost some posts that I assess to be misleading. 
Regarding his piece on KamalaHQ, I assessed his review of the 8 posts to be accurate.  There is a big difference between Trump saying of neo-Nazis that ‚Äúnothing was done wrong‚Äù [which he did not say] versus saying there was nothing wrong with his press statement. There is a big difference between JD saying ‚Äúthe shoe fits‚Äù that Republicans are anti-union vs. hearing the rest of the very same sentence that the shoe fits does not apply to him or Trump. I won‚Äôt give my analysis of each one.
I also agreed that the defenses from KamalaHQ were ‚Äúweak‚Äù or a ‚Äústretch.‚Äù
The only step I might suggest is to ask KamalaHQ if they are taking steps to be more accurate. 
Regarding the perception that Trump is not fact-checked, you can fact-check that easily. I gave my data on 40 fact-check articles [see doc I posted here a while ago]. Here you can some of Dale's articles that can be very useful to us https://www.cnn.com/profiles/daniel-dale  I‚Äôve posted here the other fact-checking sources I commonly use."

YMMV. The first usually screens out low-info trolls and bots. The second can be a wedge and/or open up an opportunity for further discussion. The third can deepen the second and can be a tie in to further discussions on the economy, inflation, and pricing."

He, like Trump, has created a platform which uplifts the worst impulses and behavior. We also know both like to ""pwn the libs"" ""for teh lulz"" to turn our functioning empathy into revenue for them. Sensationalism works.

While we cannot prevent both parties from doing what it is that they do, we can do what neither wants: Take note and/or ignore them and move on. I trust that Staff and the appropriate legal experts within the campaign and the party are also doing their part.

What we can continue to do is support each other, request community notes to those who can make them, and uplift those notes for those who can't or are awaiting approval. We can also like, share, and comment on content shared with us/among us to boost the algorithm.

Take heart. Small actions add up. We're in this together."

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP

the data they link also includes two years of Obama's administration (2014-2015) and i'm really not sure why. 

either way, Biden still ended up with more manufacturing jobs than Trump did. he even gave America _more_ manufacturing jobs post-pandemic than Trump had pre-pandemic, and has maintained that number since 2022. the person's own references don't support their claim"

The rhetoric the Trump/Vance camp is using is as absurd as it is dangerous and there are smaller/independent outlets and journalists who 1) are (and have been) drawing parallels and 2) walking people through the 14 characteristics of fascism in their own way and in their own words.

While we can't control what major media outlets do, we can have those personal (and factual) conversations across our own networks. Think: Impact Over Reach."

Not sure if this is consistent across the board, but it took ~6 hours from the time the request for a CN was made vs. when it is available to rate.

Not sure if there is some sort of threshold before a CN request is fulfilled or if there is some sort of batch process which runs on a schedule (or both?)

On September 30, a major antipoverty program went into effect in the Biden Administration and *No News Media picked it up* - even though there were press releases from the Social Security Administration. Do major News outlets read press releases from there? Specifically, the news rules creating an expansion of SSI, the program that helps people with the most severe disabilities - and that would help a huge numbers of families - were all in effect as of September 30.  (1) More than 200 diagnoses were added to the list of those to be expedited or approved. (2) SNAP and food assistance will not be counted as income towards eligibility and benefits (3) An SSI household is redefined so that more people with disabilities who live with a non-disabled person can obtain benefits (4) They won't go back more than 5 years in evaluating work history. What a person did for a living 10 years ago won't affect eligibility for a person's disability status now. (5) SNAP and SSI are being linked in some manner.  None of this is cear. No one wrote an interpretation of how this could work for individual situations. For people lining in a group home? For married vs unmarried people in a household? What the SNAP/SSI connection means and how this applies when the rules and eligibility for SNAP vary drastically in different states.  But look what this means: In Alabama, there  is a huge population of senior citizens living at or below $100 FPL. What would this do in a state like Alamaba, or a state like PA with urban poverty, if these people could suddenly have a benefits increase up to $1971 per month. Look at how this would support permanent supportive housing for the unhoused in every state and every major city or suburb. This is *huge news* and the mainstream media completely failed to report it."

I tried to promote this information in the content teams and no one listened. How do we get the word out in Goergia about all of the money going there for cancer research. Consider the jobs it created in Georgia - all of the people who get to have a career in a subject like computer science and AI and databases matching existing cancer drug molecules to the various types of cancer that they can address.  There should be a video about this. This isn't 2020 with Trump as incumbent. Harris has a lot to brag about.  The Biden Harris White House totally rocks and people need to understand it.

There is no evidence that Kamala Harris was in a Rehabilitation facility in June of 2021 as she was working and traveling.
In June of 2021 the VP traveled to Pennsylvania, New York, DC, California, Michigan, Nevada, South Carolina, Guatemala, and Texas.

Just for the record. They are using an article from the Federalist titled: ""Biden-Harris Admin Used FEMA Disaster Funding For Illegal Immigrants"" (Cant post the link because it has a donate button) but you can google that to see it. But as you can see here (about the Shelter and Services Grant Program which they are mainly referring to): https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/frequently-asked-questions-about-shelter-and-services-grant-program that it clearly states: 

""The appropriation funds U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) with $800 million to transfer to FEMA to establish a new Shelter and Services Grant Program (SSP) to support CBP in effectively managing migrant processing and preventing the overcrowding of short-term CBP holding facilities.""

So the money was ALLOCATED TO CBP and was always meant to go to CBP Programs and initiatives. It was being given FROM that budget TO the FEMA Budget so FEMA could distribute it. 

Also of note here, it leaves out that the last ""stopgap bill"" (Hope that is the correct term here) that the GOP House did and got approved apparently forgot to add in any money for FEMA and because the House has been unable to get through a full budget - that too would cause an issue with FEMA.

""On Monday, President Biden suggested he might need to summon lawmakers back to Washington to approve extra funding for disaster relief, after a stopgap bill for funding the government that passed last week did not provide the agency enough money to deal with multiple disasters.""

And also the GOP led House seems to feel there is no need to return early: [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-voted-against-fema-funding-1963980) and even [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/04/trump-fema-claim-debunked-agency-not-running-out-of-money-because-of-migrants/) has covered it really well."

I know requesting CNs in such hostile territory seems pointless on the surface. However, by keeping on keeping on, we're doing the following things:
- Ad hoc social penetration testing; what is getting through vs. what is getting blocked
- Exploring and mapping the contours and connections of the above, with real people, and in real time
- Improving a signal to noise ratio when we like/repost/quote/comment on campaign-approved tweets

Believe it or not, I kinda suck at math. However, I know enough to understand proving the absence of something is just as vital as proving the presence of something."

A Quick Recap of Things We Have Learned/Noticed:
- If you don't have the ability to request a CN or have a newer (e.g. less than six months old) account, you can still contribute by rating them
- If your account meets the requirements to request CNs and you decide to sign up, the period between the sign up and when access is granted will vary
- Rating notes can be done in two ways: For those of us on a tablet/laptop, we can copy-paste the string of numbers onto the end of the URI pattern: https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t + tweet ID; moving forward we will include the full URI for folks accessing CNs on mobile
- Yes. We know. Let's do what we can to keep the channel clear and focused in the days to come

Thank you and we got this!"

My apologies for not putting the tag first, it's been a bit since I was here regularly.

Also, would it be possible to DM you  directly tomorrow? I believe I can help map out the disinformation network for you after 3+ yrs as a Jan 6 sedition hunter. There are multiple paid influencer networks targeting the campaign; I can  identify a number of the influencers  who met at the behest of the Trump campaign for debate war rooms.

I believe anyone with a link to the CN has the ability to vote if it is Helpful, Somewhat Helpful and Not Helpful. Generally speaking, those links follow the URI pattern of https://x.com/i/birdwatch/t + the UUID of the tweet in question (usually a long string of numbers before the ""?"")

To be able to create CNs, Twitter does have some prerequisites and there seems to be some latency between when folks apply to be able to do so and when folks are granted the ability.

Feel free to DM me and, perhaps, we can walk through how/what to rate together?

I know it can seem like a lot at first, but once you've gone through the process a few times it'll become easier.

Also, we do offer mis/disinformation training and how to push back on it. You can sign up here:
