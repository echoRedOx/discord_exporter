Content: Hi <@1276944202621517825> usually the training sessions text you the link for the zoom. Can you make sure your text messages aren't blocked.

Content: <@568257600228032512>, yes I got the text and same thing it wants google meet. Thank you, I could not get that session, so I am taking another in less than an hour, again in GA however the link I got went to zoom. . All of this  is a lot to take in, thank god we have training sessions, I am just exploring the apps, doing a test run on a couple of pet and community ones. Looking forward to part 2 for online. I am also trying to organize my family and some friends.

Content: Hi <@1276944202621517825> thanks for telling me more. I assumed the training was with the national team, which only uses zoom. to be honest I have no idea what the GA teams use. But now I know to ask volunteers where they are volunteering. If you need help managing the overwhelm of discord, we have a little video for that. https://youtu.be/cA32MMsN61g
