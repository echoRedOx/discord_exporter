Election anxiety is real and it could help talk about the real stakes people have with the election

But I urge **extreme caution**. I've seen channels in other servers centered around anxiety, and they each ended up reinforcing, strengthening, and spreading the anxiety everywhere. Basically formed a doom spiral."

Specifically sectioning out mental health (creating a channel or even just searching for posts like it) can be extremely triggering if you don't have any mental conditioning against it (eg cognitive behavioral therapy)."

It would only be mob group therapy, with so many people in it that the conversation wouldn't be able to be guided enough."

I also understand the idea, but as this is the official campaign server, it is strictly for organizing, uplifting and supporting volunteers. We also have to consider the possibility that a channel like that could trigger or cause strong reactions in others. It would also be difficult to moderate, as we aren't professionals that could guide a channel like that to be a safe place for everyone."

It is a very thoughtful and caring idea. Mental health issues are important and we want all of our volunteers to be safe. In these situations its best if individuals utilize local or therapeutic online resources. We have to err on the side of caution as we aren't qualified to give out any type of specific advice.
