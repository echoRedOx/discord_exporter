Thanks so much for volunteering with us. We appreciate you. You can use Reach as an app on your phone or on the web. Open up on the web: democrats.org/reach-social/ When looking at an action item, you usually need to scroll down on a phone and then you'll find the sharing button, then pick the social network, then finish the action there. Once that finishes, if you (on an iPhone) press the top left arrow to get back to Reach, you'll get a pop up there in a second that says thanks for sharing or something similiar. This finishes the action and likely adds your points. Sometimes Reach doesn't know that your share went through and may give you a pop up asking, ""Did you share it?"" So,  in those cases, you will have to confirm. Like any app, it can get busy or a bit buggy. In those cases try refreshing or come back in a few minutes. I hope this helps! If you need additional support you can email the staff at reach@dnc.org to get additional assistance. Thanks again!"

I just tried again and it went as expected. The first time, I was asked to download the video and copy the text, then upload to wherever and paste the text. I knew that wasn’t what the training described but went ahead with it anyway. All’s well, it was good practice!"
