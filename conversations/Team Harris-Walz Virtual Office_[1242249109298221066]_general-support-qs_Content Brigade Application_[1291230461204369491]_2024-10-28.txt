Content: Hi! I submitted a form to volunteer for the content brigade. I didnâ€™t get a confirmation email, so I just wanted to check it was received. ðŸ™‚ If you need more info, my dms should be open.

Content: Hello <@1288293420162613380> did you submit your form recently? or was it more than two weeks ago? Content brigade changed the application process about two weeks ago and asked folks to re-apply. with this form https://txt.democrats.org/CreatorTeamApply if that is the form you used, I suggest being patient and they should reach or submit the form again to bring it to their attention.
