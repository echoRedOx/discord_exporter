  content: "Well about an hour in people started to ask about parking and asked if\
    \ there was still parking available. I\u2019ve tried to park in Atlanta and it\u2019\
    s a mess, I didn\u2019t want to tell people there was or wasn\u2019t parking available\
    \ so I asked on here.\nNo one answered until 3 minutes before the phone bank ended\
    \ (while I was trying to get on the zoom) so I didn\u2019t make any more calls.\n\
    \nI can\u2019t remember what the script said exactly, but a lot of it was very\
    \ wordy so I trimmed some down because I could tell people didn\u2019t want to\
    \ be on the phone too long.\nAdditionally, the dialer was kind of slow, typically\
    \ took 30 seconds to a minute to connect to a call."

  content: Hi, thank you for sharing your experience (and apologies for not answering
    your parking question earlier) and your feedback! As to the script, it often can
    be super clunky so you did the right thing in cutting it down, which you are 100%
    welcome to do! And yeah, the dialer is a lot slower when there's not a ton of
    people making calls.
