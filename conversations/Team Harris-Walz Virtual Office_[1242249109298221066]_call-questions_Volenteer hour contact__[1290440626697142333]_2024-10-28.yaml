  content: 'Hi guys! Long time ~~listener~~ reader, first time caller (hehe get it),
    so im a current high school student that wants to help out calling/texting or
    really anyway possible. My school has a requirement to get a certain amount of
    hours to graduate and further awards if you go above and beyond for community
    service. I have clarified with school admin that political campaigns are fine
    to claim as I am working for a local canidate #cass4tx for a bunch of hours already
    and want to know if I can get hours from this? also in our portal we need to put
    in a contact person to make sure I actually did the work and that contact details
    are in the form of a phone number or email for verification. If I am allowed to
    claim hours whom should I put down and what details should I put in? Thanks Yall'

    need a contact email who could confirm the number of hours he put in, is this
    possible?

  content: "Hey <@669675021161070603> - we have done this for student volunteers.\
    \ I would say to just keep track of your shifts (either phone banking or texting)\
    \ and when you are ready, reach back out to us. We can identify someone who can\
    \ sign off for you and set up for you to DM the form to them. Easy peasy! \n\n\
    Do you know how to sign up for shifts?"

  content: Once you've gone through a phone bank shift and feel comfortable, we have
    anytime calling, so you can jump in and just call when you have time. But I would
    suggest starting with a Zoom phone bank so you have support people there to answer
    questions and make sure you're comfortable with it.
