Content: Strong Harris supporter and former Dem volunteer who said she **would not** vote for Gallego because she saw a commercial about him presenting divorce papers as his (now ex) wife was giving birth. I saw stories about the papers being unsealed and not containing anything notable. Other than noting how awful and dangerous Kari Lake is, any suggestions for gracefully addressing this? Only came up once thankfully, and reported via debrief.

Content: <@795140291241181195> Yes, this is a touchy one. I researched this a little to see what I could find. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news org sued to get the divorce papers released. Kate Gallego has said their divorce records formalized how the couple would raise their son apart from each other. Both expressed worry that public disclosure of the records could endanger the boy. There was nothing to hide in regards to the details. They did get divorced when she was pregnant, not while giving birth. I guess I would just say that the story was misleading about the timing, and he gave the reason for the divorce that PTSD from serving in Iraq put a strain on their marriage which is unfortunate, but it doesn't make him a bad guy.

Content: Iâ€™d also bring up the fact that Kate Gallego actually *endorses* Ruben for Senate. Clearly, she thinks well enough of him and his character to do so despite the divorce
