By the way, I can only pass onto the [content created by volunteers](https://app.reach.vote/library/gallery/c07cfbbe-ed31-4770-8303-833364ba39b8?campaign=democrats) gallery by the Content Brigade."

None of the ones in there are wrong, and they're all semi relevant, but there's not a lot of newer content to share about what the race looks like for LGBTQ people now. Maybe we add some graphics or videos of quotes from Harris and Walz, like more content from when Harris visited the RuPaul set or content about Walz being the head of the G/S alliance? It's only a suggestion!"

(The Content Brigade only has the [content created by volunteers](https://app.reach.vote/library/gallery/c07cfbbe-ed31-4770-8303-833364ba39b8?campaign=democrats) gallery.)  You can ask if Out For Harris-Walz controls the LGBTQ+ gallery."
