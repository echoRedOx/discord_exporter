  content: I am already on a Texas-focused campaign in REACH, but when I use REACH
    for this national Harris-Walz campiagn, I do NOT want to lose all the Texas data
    I entered into REACH. Can I toggle between campaigns in the REACH app WITHOUT
    losing all my data entered for the previous cmapign? The REACH chat support people
    cannot answer this quesion; they say they will e-mail me later. This is such a
    simple question. Anybody know the answer?

  content: Yes, you can add multiple [campaign keys](https://www.reach.vote/knowledge-base/adding-users/).  (Most
    states have their own state campaigns.  If you don't have a campaign key, then
    you can ask for an invite.)  The national party's campaign key is ZUMT5Q.

  content: 'Thank you for the reply! Yes, I know that I can use the ZUMT5Q code for
    this national campaign. BUT are you absolutley sure I will not lose any data I
    already entered for the Powered By People campaign in Texas (which is NOT connected
    in any way to this national effort)? When I go to enter the ZUMT5Q code, the REACH
    app warns me with this: "You will no longer be able to access Powered By People
    in Reach."'

  content: Are you adding the campaign key in https://app.reach.vote/campaigns (not
    leaving Powered By People's campaign)?  In Reach, I joined the campaigns of the
    national Party, DCCC and my state party.  However, I never got the warning that
    you quoted (which would also worry me if I got it).

  content: No, I am going to my profile in the app and that's when I get the warning.
    I think I can just use the 6-letter code at the end of the URL in a web browser
    view of REACH and maybe that will not give me the warning. My guess is that the
    warning was carelessly written.. and that it is probably easy to simply toggle
    between campaigns. I'll try it via web browser instead of the app. Thanks for
    checking your approcah. That is re-assuring.

  content: Your approach worked for me just fine, without losing data. I bet it will
    work on the app too. Thank you very much for your help!!!
