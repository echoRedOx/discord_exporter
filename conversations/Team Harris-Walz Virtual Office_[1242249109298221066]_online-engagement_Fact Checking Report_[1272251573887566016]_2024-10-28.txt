Content: Hi Jessica -- Someone was asking for fact-checking on Tim  Walz's ties to a Muslim cleric. I can't find the message now, but maybe you've seen it? I thought it was on online-engagement. I did a search. MANY right-wing outlets reported on the supposed ties 3 days ago, e.g. Fox News https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-walz-ties-muslim-cleric-antisemitic-views-gave-state-funding-group-report Does not look like the ties are very direct. One time the cleric helped Walz calm protesters. Walz supported the Muslim community in many ways https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2024/08/06/five-faith-facts-tim-walz-lutheran-248512 Perhaps someone can create a message about the true nature of the ties -- Walz did not support any anti-semitic views.
