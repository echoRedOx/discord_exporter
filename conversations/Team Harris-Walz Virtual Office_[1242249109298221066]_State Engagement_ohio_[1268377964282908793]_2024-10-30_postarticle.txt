Content: Hello from Mount Vernon in Knox County. Long-time Dem volunteer and former county chair. Just thought I'd mention we won for Obama and we can do it again! Also, it is important to tell college students that voter ID laws have changed in Ohio. They need to be prepared with an Ohio driver's license, an Ohio state ID, or a passport (a couple of other military-related IDs can be used). They can't use a phone or utility bill. We want our out-of-state students who are living here to be able to vote in Ohio!

Content: I thought Ohio was a lost cause, but recent polls hint at a change. I fear putting a Kamala Harris yard sign up in my typical middle-class neighborhood. The hate and anger that comes from the people who have Trump yard signs is tangible. But I am going to do it anyway! It is too essential, and there is too much at stake to let fear of reprisal stop us.

Content: I‚Äôm in red Mahoning County. I haven‚Äôt been out much lately, but a friend reported actually seeing Harris Walz signs out! If you know anything about Mahoning, you understand how huge that is. My husband & I just decided to order signs despite our red neighborhood. If they take them, I‚Äôll make my own darn signs and replace them. Maybe we can organize a Zoom or meet ups. We‚Äôre Not Going Back!

Content: If you are in Ohio, I would double check your registration as well. They did do some trimming of the rolls. 

Also of note, apparently there is now a new way to add your Ohio State ID to your Apple Wallet. That said, I would not use that as your voter ID on the day of voting if you vote in person. Take your regular Photo ID and advise others to do so as well (I'm more than a bit worried it will be used as a way to reject votes/voters) and going by the video below it seems my fears were right sadly üò¶

Content: Be sure to watch for any info on social media saying that you CAN use the Apple Wallet ID for voting....and post the people this link (and maybe post it on your Facebook to any Ohio friends and family so they know as well) Id post it yet again come closer to Nov too.

Content: Everyone keeps saying "Ohio is red" but honestly we have always been a pretty purple state that is diverse as far as its electorate. Seeing how the votes on both Abortion and also on Super Majority dictating the Ohio Constitution, I think Ohio has a shot to be turned honestly. Its a no-nonsense state with a lot of really amazing people. I think the issue is that many just don't realize the things being said by DJT. Lots of voters have just always voted Conservative (like regular DeWine Conservative or Kaisch Conservative) forever and belive the "radical" heading the left gets. I think that could be changed if we can find a way to point out that what DJT is proposing is actually radical.

Content: When people bring up that Democrats are to blame for Ohios problems or for any bad policy that happens inside Ohio, I always point out that Ohio is a Republican Trifecta state (IE ALL the power in this state is in the hands of the GOP - Governor, House Majority, Senate Majority) and that it has been for 26+ years. If we have problems in Ohio or "want change" then supporting the Democratic Party/Harris would be that change - not voting for more of the same. I also mention that with 26+ years of complete control, shouldn't Ohio be a Republican utopia?

Content: Also that paragraph at the top of that page says a lot too. There are more Republican Trifectas and Triplexes within the states than there are Dem ones. So again, shouldn't this entire country be a Republican Utopia when they hold so much power and have?

Content: I've not directly heard any policy on farming yet. I have family with a large farm in Ohio as well so I too would like to know where she stands there or what the plans are. I will say that Walz has been strong on Agriculture so hopefully they will take a serious look at the topic and come up with things that are good for farmers.

Content: A recap of 2025 if that helps you in regard to that. Farms will not be allowed to have Federal and Private crop insurance, insurance subsidies lowered to 46% instead of 60% and will ONLY be allowed for farms GROSSING under $500k a year. My daughter married into a farm that does popcorn for the largest companies out there. They have 40k acres. Obviously it's easy for them to see why not to vote Trump but I keep running into the little guys that vote based solely on their hobby farms.

Content: Aundrea, I completely agree 100%.  We are a purple state with a lot of people who watch Faux News.  And let's not forget gerrymandering.  But I am in Delaware County.  We have been working hard to flip this county blue.  And that Blue Wave is coming.  It has been building up for at least a decade or more now.  I've been actively involved since 2015, and became an "insider" since 2016.  My county beat the statewide average last November for reproductive rights.   We sided with the progressives the past 2 elections.  If we can keep up this same momentum in November, we will totally flip Ohio.  

And there is a quiet optimism in the air right now.  Can you feel it?  Big burly truck dudes holding doors open and showing something resembling manners lately.  Heck, I have some Trumpies chatting with me on the daily now.  Either they are planning my demise, or they are feeling optimistic.  Heck, our neighborhood obnoxious Trumpet Goon that blanketed his whole yard with large obnoxious signs and flags, only has one normal size yardsign at the moment.  ü§£üòÇ  I feel like that is totally a sign of doubt.

Content: While reading through the messages above  I noticed one referring to being able to put one's Ohio State ID  into your Apple Wallet. Of course this is true. However, voters cannot present their Ohio State ID that would reside in the Apple Wallet as a form of ID when they vote in Ohio. It must be the physical ID.  If this has already been posted I apologize for the duplicate.  Please share with those you know so they are aware. Here is a link to a related article: https://fox8.com/news/ohios-new-mobile-id-isnt-valid-for-voting/

Content: Just making sure folks have heard about LaRose's latest directive - He is unhappy that he lost a court case and needs to allow more people to return ballots for folks with disability, so he has directed that no one may put another person's ballot in a drop box.  Per this directive, if you are dropping of the ballot of a family member or disable person, you need to go inside the board of elections and sign a form affirming that you are permitted to submit the ballot for them.

Content: MSNBC talking heads basically speculated he heard about the sensation headline or social media post that matches his narrative without actually fact-checking it that of course the moderator crushed him on with the fact check receipts.

Content: Yeah, read other comments during the debate I think that mentioned Rubio was making this link without bases. Also, the pets being eaten comments are popped on the daily show and other late night comedy show bits. Plus it‚Äôs all over memes and the internet.

Content: Hi Anna, it would be wonderful to get a lot of signatures, so I encourage you to share a description of this change page instead of the link. The link is a problem because the change.org page asks for financial support which means we would be breaking campaign finance law by sharing it here.

Content: So you would want to vote Yes if you want a group of citizens (evenly distributed across ideological lines) rather than whichever politicians are in power at the time to debate/discuss/take feedback/draw and come to a consensus on redistricting. A No vote would keep things as they are now which is described fairly well here: https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/ohio/?cycle=2020&level=Congress&startdate=2022-03-02

Content: Hi pals! Has anyone had issues with not seeing an approved absentee ballot even 3+ weeks after sending it off to the election office? I called the franklin county office a week ago and they said they had received my absentee ballot application but that they did not have any clue when it would be approved. Just wondering since I know ballots are starting to be mailed out october 8th

Content: Its a lot different atm where I am too. Granted, our county usually breaks Dem but but county went for Trump in 2020 and there were DJT signs everywhere. This year, I see TONS of Harris signs and then scattered singular yards with like 10 DJT signs in that one yard.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.
