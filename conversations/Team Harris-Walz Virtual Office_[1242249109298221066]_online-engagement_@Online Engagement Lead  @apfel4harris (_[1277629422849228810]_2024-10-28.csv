I've applied to help both the main Harris/Walz HQ content brigade and a comms team run by Dems Abroad, but haven't heard back yet from either. I'm interested in drafting texts (whatever's needed) for the campaign teams to polish up and use. For online engagement, I'd be happy to draft posts or responses for others to edit as they/you see fit and use. As for posting messages myself: I only have a LinkedIn account nowadays, so my own reach is limited. I haven't joined an Online Engagement training yet because I don't have a US phone numberâ€”would set up a G-Voice number to use for registration if it makes sense for me to join a training."

Probably my best bet would be to join the Dems Abroad comms team, as Dems Abroad have insta-infrastructure for those of us living abroad. But I've not heard back and time's passing..."
