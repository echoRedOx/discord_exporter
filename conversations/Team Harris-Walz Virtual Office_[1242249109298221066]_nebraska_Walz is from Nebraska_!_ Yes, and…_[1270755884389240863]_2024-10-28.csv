Walz said his biggest claim to fame in high school was that he was named to the Norfolk Daily News‚Äô Top 20 All Area football team. His senior year, the Butte Wildcats went 8-1 and the basketball team went 16-4.

‚ÄúIt was K-12 all in one building (in Butte) and during summers we worked on the farm,‚Äù Walz said. ‚ÄúI still have great friends from there. People in that graduating class ended up very successful. Nebraska has gotten a lot of criticism for not consolidating a lot of schools, but I believe that small classrooms and teaching in small classes has helped with the work ethic.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of successful people who have come from the small classrooms all over Nebraska. You didn‚Äôt get lost in the shuffle. Every student was an individual whose voice mattered.‚Äù"

These are the glory days of Nebraska football. In the comments when this was posted on Reddit are at least four other people who were at this game. One was 13, it was his first football game, and he threw snowballs at the people on the goal posts. This is a very Nebraska story. You can go to a bar in NYC, meet a Nebraskan, and find out your cousin married his elementary school art teacher. Nebraskans act irritated when someone assumes we all know each other, but it‚Äôs a little true."
