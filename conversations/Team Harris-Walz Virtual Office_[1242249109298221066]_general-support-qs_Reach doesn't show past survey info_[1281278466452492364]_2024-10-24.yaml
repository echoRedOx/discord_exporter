  content: I submitted eight survey reports in Reach in the past few days, but Reach
    does not allow me to view my own reports submitted. Is there any way to allow
    me to see what I submitted? Without the ability to see the details of what I submitted,
    I have no reason to submit Reach surveys. I have at least 10 Facebook Groups and
    about 10 other online platforms (X, Threads, TikTok, LinkedIn, Reddit, Nextdoor,
    Instagram, Substack, Truth Social, YouTube etc) to engage, which takes a lot of
    time just to keep track of my engagements. So now I have to create my own spreadsheet
    to keep track and avoid duplicate efforts. Wouldn't it be easier for Reach to
    allow me to see my own survey report submissions? Thank you.

  content: Hi Joe! My understanding of the survey reports in Reach are that they use
    those internally to notice trends and such. I'm not sure if any staff here could
    ask the team who manages the Reach app about this, but someone should see it and
    hopefully let you know here if there's anything else we might be able to do. Thank
    you for your online engagement for the campaign! You're doing a great job!

  content: Thank you for your reply. I will create my Google Sheet and share it with
    somebody on the team in the future instead of submitting Reach reports each time.
    Thx!
