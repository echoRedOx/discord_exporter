Content: I took text team training on 8/24, and then got on Discord, completed the required form, passed the quiz, and signed up on Scale To Win. Everything was done by 8/26, and I understand I would be notified when I was cleared to begin sending out texts within two days, but I haven’t heard from anyone yet. Just checking to see if I missed something. I’d like to begin contributing to the campaign. Thanks.
