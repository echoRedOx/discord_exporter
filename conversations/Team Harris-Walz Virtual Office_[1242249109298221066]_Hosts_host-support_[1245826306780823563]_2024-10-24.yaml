  content: Just submitted our watch party event for approval! We are fired up and
    ready to go! Hope the toolkit is ready to go soon! I was thinking QR codes scattered
    around the room for people to sign up to phonebank/textbank etc. Would also love
    donation envelopes and a graphic or three.

  content: I've been really liking streamin it on twitch because of how good their
    bots are for trolls and theres some requirements to chat in the chat. Like for
    me, I have a ten minute follow time before you can say anything. Which strongly
    discourages trolls. I can barely remember my thought two minutes ago let alone
    ten lolol. I dont know too much about zoom, are there any bots for it that might
    help with issues like that?

    event? I was able to switch it back to public and when i exited the page and went
    back, it was private again. I was wondering why my sign ups slowed down lol.

    think if you set yourself an attendance goal say 10 people. You can say Im hosting
    a watch party and fundraiser. Join me in donating $50 to add link. Lets raise
    $500 for Kamala and celebrate by watching the debate together.

  content: The staff would be the best to answer this question. In the meantime I
    want to acknowledge that I agree with you. I want to host an event too but felt
    overwhelmed quickly by the process. The mods and staff come around and answer
    questions periodically. I have been doing getting in touch with some folks who
    i havent talked in a while, but I miss them. Just checking on them to see how
    they are doing/how they are feeling about it all so I know who is going to be
    all in with me and who we can convince to campaign with us. When I was campaigning
    for Bernie I really didnt know what to do after I hosted the event, mostly because
    everyone that came was not sure what they wanted to do. So think about what it
    is that makes you miss these folks and open your conversations honestly. I have
    not felt this alive in a while. I'm saying that to my friends and my family. Also
    knowing that not everyone is goign to be able to campaign, but maybe they can
    donate or should come to your watch party is you share the link to your event
    on your social media or text it to your friends. In my initial reach out to folks
    I added an invitation to this group. To some I said in case you want to get involved
    or I see what you are doing and we need you here too.

    if there was a tool kit and/or a way to set up a designated QR code or link to

    guidance would be helpful.

  content: People stayed muted and as host (and the co-hosts too) we can mute them
    if need be. That said, folks wanted to watch the DNC and only chatted during breaks
    or interludes. They were incredibly courteous and thoughtful. We as hosts hardly
    had to do a thing. (I know from experience that is not always the case) There
    were indeed times when folks wanted to chat but they kept it to a minimum.

  content: <@923456786504253470> that is the way of it with some of these swing state
    lists. I always remind callers that every contact helps the campaign because they
    are either helping us cull the list to remove MAGA voters so we can focus our
    final push efforts on mobilizing undecided and Harris voters or they are helping
    us to bring more Harris supporters into our volunteer ranks.

  content: <@1280356902206701609> if you have everyone with you in person, I would
    suggest you create a bitly link for the dialer. Have you used bitly before? This
    way, you can make an abbreviated URL and a QR code so your volunteers have a couple
    of options for accessing the link

  content: I did not find any affiliated local letter writing orgs with listed events
    on Mobilize, but I think the teens who are working or will be looking for work
    soon would benefit from a labor rights awareness. Thus, we have a local candidate
    for State Labor Board who has listed an event. You can coordinate with them locally.

    In my experience, this was not easy to accomplish. My local independent team had
    to reach out to personal contacts in battleground states to get Harris-supporter
    targeted lists, which took time and buy-in from those state contacts. You might
    try asking in your state channel. (EG- I''m in TX so it''d be [# Texas] (without
    the space in between).'

  content: It will be just like the current dialer link but your own custom link to
    it so that the dialer ties the calls being made directly to your event only and
    we can track those. Very cool! Looks just like the regular dialer link but with
    some extra characters with name of your event that tie it to your event.

    copy the link it it makes to the right and use that as your custom dialer link
    at all your events from now on. Then check back later on tab 3 for the results!

    a local office (either Dems or a candidate's). That way precincts and canvassing
    areas can be assigned out and they can track how much coverage they have. You
    can also get support and literature through them. Thank you so much for hosting
    an event and I hope you have a wonderful time canvassing! It can be a lot of fun!

  content: Didn't see anything...I tried DMing Quinn, but don't see a response. Now
    I see there's another YouTuber/Podcaster, this one from Florida. Think I'm going
    to shut it down.

  content: Hi all, is there a canvassing training deck that I can use?  I'm organizing
    a national canvass day with 15 canvasses/trips on Saturday (with Doctors for Harris
    and Nurses for America), all connected with local field offices.  We're going
    to have a Zoom with the participants tomorrow (Thursday) night.  I know every
    location will have training on Saturday but would love for folks to get a head
    start and get out to the doors as quickly as they can.
