  content: 'Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House
    with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from
    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
    MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks
    is crucial.

  content: <@&1245910301916921929> Early voting has started in many of the swing states,
    so this weekend is CRITICAL to our GOTV efforts. It's also incredibly important
    that we make sure that people with mail in ballots have gotten their ballots and
    understand how to return them. This is such important work, and we have to close
    strong. But we can't make our 10 million call goal without your help. If you're
    experienced, you can go straight to our dialer [here ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=933f666e-c699-46e3-ac92-12d9cf6f3992)
    - if you're new, please join us over in <#1242256751445934262> to get connected
    to some training! (If you don't have that, go to  <id:customize>  and choose "talk
    to voters in key states.") Even making a few calls helps. Many hands make light
    work. Will you please come over and join us?
