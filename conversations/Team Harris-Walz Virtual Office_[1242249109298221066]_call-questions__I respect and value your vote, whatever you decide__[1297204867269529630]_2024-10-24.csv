I said: ""Does it count for double if we turn a red vote blue, or a non-voter blue, or a red vote non-voting?"" That last part is the part that I want to take back. I wouldn't ever be able to stop a red voter from voting. In fact, I kind of think we should get creds for motivating any non-voters to come out to the polls, even if they choose the other side this time around. This spurred me to a more surprising insight last night.

I was thinking about the reasons I have been failing to convince Georgia voters. I took the time to step back and think carefully over all my calls, trying to identify key factors for success. It had been staring me in the face all along. As soon as I saw it it made perfect sense. Here's the line:

""I respect and value your vote.""

I tend to say this at the end of conversations just before I hang up if I have failed to convince a red voter. But I realised that I tend to fail when I forget to say this, and that when I take the trouble to say it right up front at the beginning of conversations, it really changes the entire mood.
When I was using this line on independent and undecided voters in Michigan and Wisconsin, it came with a series of subsequent arguments that went like this: ""We're lucky to have the priviliege of getting to pick this way. There are only a handful of countries in the world where we get to do this, and no matter how bad it looks from the inside, this one is a shining light in countries around the world.."" Etc. 
I think this single line might be the crucial element. I'm going to experiment today and see."
