How about making a assist program to help Americans that are looking for work or new work. Move to new areas. This way companies posting jobs that the Local base does not have to fulfill these positions could be taken from other parts of the country and the cost to move and help finding new place can be setup by the program to help distribute jobs better <@766548745223405579>
