I believe you are also in our Slack space, and we are still texting there (same lists). We're going to work on moving all texting to Discord (and move existing Slack texters to Discord too) -- so more to come soon!"

We updated our onboarding process here last week, so that’s what happened (we’re re-adding folks to the text channels). But for anyone texting with us in Slack, we’ll be moving folks over to Discord soon!"
