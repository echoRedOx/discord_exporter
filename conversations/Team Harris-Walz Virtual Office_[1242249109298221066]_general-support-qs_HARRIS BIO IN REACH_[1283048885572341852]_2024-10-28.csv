I saw one on Facebook but want a great one to upload today.  I use REACH for social media.  Where can I find it?  Thanks!

The print type and then the video.  I want to encourage folk online to volunteer with REACH graphics and “in the field” photos.  I’ll be out canvassing.  I can mix that with campaign graphics and video.  This should take me to October 1st.  Use the same strategy for Gov Walz.  NC starts early voting around Oct 17 and “Souls to the Polls” is Oct. 20th when we shift into high gear.  I love REACH content because it’s “professional.”  I have a Facebook buddy that has a graphic that I can “snatch.”  Just wanted to see if the campaign had anything better…. Looking forward to obtaining stuff from tonight’s debate!  I’m “all in!”  Will be canvassing and “banking!”  Thanks for your help!
