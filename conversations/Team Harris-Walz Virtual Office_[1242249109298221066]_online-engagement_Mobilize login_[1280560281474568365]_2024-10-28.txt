Content: Then you have multiple accounts on Mobilize.  I suggest sticking to the email address that you've already registered for scheduled upcoming events.

Content: When I go into Discord to change my e-mail to my gmail acct, it requires that I get an e-mail at my comcast inbox to  get a verification code in order to chnage my discord e-mail... BUT I never get the verification code e-mail in my comcast inbox (and its not in junk spam either). I am stuck with Discord on comcast e-mail and mobilize on gmail.. which means I will never get the e-mails with training slides

Content: Discord is separate from Mobilize.  (If you've enabled "followup messages" in Mobilize, then Mobilize would have sent the followup to the same email address that you registered for that event.)

Content: You can ask in <#1250550849998946417>, but I haven't heard of the slides being sent in a followup email.
