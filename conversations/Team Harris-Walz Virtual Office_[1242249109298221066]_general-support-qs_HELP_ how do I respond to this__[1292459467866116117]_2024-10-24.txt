Content: Musk photo from a neighbor. On second photo, items in blue are my feeble response. Not trying to reason with this person, just provide facts in response to his conspiracy theory.

Content: Thanks for this but I was looking something that would shut down the lies about the immigration numbers that Musk is advancing and the illegality of them fast tracking to citizenship so theyâ€™ll vote Dem.

Content: Good morning Joyce! Thank you so much for fighting so hard against misinformation. Autumn provided some awesome resources. 

Don't be dismayed if no resources or data will sway many folks. Sometimes our effectiveness is best served by knowing who is open and who is not and focusing on those who are open to discussing issues and partial to facts and not conspiracy theories. And remember self-care! 

Spending time with fence-sitters who are trying to make a decisions, rather those who already have made a decision, is the most effective way to find more votes for Kamala. 

Thanks for the good, hard work you're doing!

Content: Thank you Ophelia , points well made. I have sparred with this neighbor before and heâ€™s drunk the Koolaid. No reasoning. I want to be accurately informed about this, for my own benefit as well as being prepared to respond down the road.  <@936622618293968958> thanks for the excellent links. I was just about to try to find an answer to the question of states such as CA, not requiring voter identification. How will they prevent fraud?

Content: I have seen that and some others. From what I read, they believe the ID at registration is sufficient. Folks on the right view the headline as ripe for voter fraud.

Content: Yeah, I totally agree. Unfortunately, news outlets gain viewership with antics like misleading headlines.
