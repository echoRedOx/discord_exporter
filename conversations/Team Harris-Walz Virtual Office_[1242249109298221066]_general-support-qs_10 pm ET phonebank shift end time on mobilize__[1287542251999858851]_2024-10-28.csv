I noticed the late night shift is listed as 10pm - 11:30pm EDT. Is that accurate? I assumed this would be a standard 2 hour shift. I'm going to be facilitating at that time, so want to be able to send out the right timeframe. I'm not sure if it can be corrected in mobilize. Thanks!

This is the link where I'm seeing this at: https://events.democrats.org/event/664004/"

Is it 90 minutes or 2 hours? The mobilize link shows only 90 minutes for that shift, whereas all the others are 2 hours."

Yes I do believe it should still be 2 hours. They may have it cut off since it is technically the next day at 12:00am?"

Thanks for replying. I will assume it's 2 hours. I still wonder if they could edit it on mobilize so people generally would know what timeframe is expected when signing up. That's above my pay grade ($0) though."

Sergio, would you mind clarifying the time-frame for the 10pm shift, will it be 2-hours like other shifts?"
