  content: I clicked the option showing my pronouns, clicked every emoji representing
    my pronouns, and moused over the rest of that sceen in "Personalize-your-profile',
    but nothing seems to happen.  I can't tell if my pronouns have been set (or what
    else to do to set them), and I don't see a way to move to the next profile personalization
    questions.
