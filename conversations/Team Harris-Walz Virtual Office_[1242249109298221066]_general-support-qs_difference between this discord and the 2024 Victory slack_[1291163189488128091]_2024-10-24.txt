Content: I joined this Discord upon referral from the text training highlighted in the 2024 Slack—my understanding is that I’ll soon be added to channels here related to texting. But there’s a lot more going on here, too! What else goes on here vs on Slack?

Content: Hi <@802377197230620722>, welcome! <a:pikachuwave:1269004336047067227>  This is the official hub for all things related to Harris-Walz volunteer organizing! I see you've already added some roles. If you want to see the <#1266829704204386334> channel, make sure you hit "Text voters in key states" under <id:customize>. You can go there to ask questions related to texting. We also recently launched anytime calling right here on Discord. Check out <#1242256751445934262> if you'd like to learn more. Have you already signed up for any shifts on Mobilize?
