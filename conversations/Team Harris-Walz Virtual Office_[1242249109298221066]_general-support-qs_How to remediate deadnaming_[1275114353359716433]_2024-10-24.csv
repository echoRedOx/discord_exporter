I suspect some but not all of them come from the texting team here, but the truth is I can’t be certain. 

What I do know is I’ve asked multiple times for my record to be changed to reflect my preferred name. And it still hasn’t happened.

Does anyone here have a way to update that info once and for all? 🙏🏻💜"

I hope this helps!"

What I worry about is that it won’t reach the national level in a timely manner and I will continue to be deadnamed anyway for the duration of our campaign.

Also, if they give me the “it’s not your legal name” excuse then I will have some especially strong words as well. It is not necessarily safe for folks to legally change their name at various points in time. A social name change must be plenty. Behind the scenes there are cases where a legal name must be used but out in the open it’s a very different matter. 

Addressing someone by their chosen/preferred name is nothing less than a life saving act, and that doesn’t just apply to the LGBTQ+ community.

So I ask again, even as I’m reaching out to my state org, is there anyone HERE who has connections to help expedite that change?"

I’ve also messaged my spouse who is a NJ Dems state committee member from our county as well, and our amazing county clerk who may also have ideas.

The text messages have just increased so much it’s like death by a thousand cuts to keep seeing the wrong name in a campaign you’re simultaneously trying your level best to enthusiastically support. It legit hurts.

Meanwhile, still open to other thoughts and info."
