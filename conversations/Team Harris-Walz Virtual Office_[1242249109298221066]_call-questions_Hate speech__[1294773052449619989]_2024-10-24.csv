I think I have managed to have a real impact on people's lives and to inspire some great campaign events. Maybe I have a slight accent, either because I've been abroad or because my dad was British.
Today I was calling into Nevada to independent voters with the NV dems. I  don't want to alarm anyone, but I just wondered what our procedure should be if any of the callers we speak to should cross over the line into hate speech or threats. I expect the laws are different in different states about this."

Please take a break if you feel like it would help and reset. We really appreciate you being here and making these calls with us! 

We have the hostile response option for people who are mean and I'm also going to see if we have further guidance to answer your question about hate speech, so please hold tight while I work on getting an answer for you."

Right now that's the guidance we are being given. Thank you again for making calls as part of our team. With your help, we will win!"
