Content: Hi I'm phone banking for Michigan right now, and people keep telling me the connectino is bad. Is there any way we can test out our connection. I'm using my computer to make the calls and would really prefer to keep doing that. I'm using a good microphone and headphones with a decent internet connection.

Content: Hi Daniel, I don't know of a way to test the connection. One possible solution is to try leaving the Zoom (if you are still in it). I was on a training the other day and they said zoom can mess with the audio.
