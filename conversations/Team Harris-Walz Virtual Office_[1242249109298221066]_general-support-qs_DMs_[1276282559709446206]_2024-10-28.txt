Content: Several posts say DMs come to the ‚Äúgame controller‚Äù icon which is the usual Discord image in the upper left. I don‚Äôt have that icon on mine. Instead, right above the pic of Kamala, there‚Äôs what looks like a chat icon in Zoom or iMessage on iPhone or iPad. I use Discord on my iPad, haven‚Äôt installed on my Mac. 1) Do I receive and send DMs through this chat icon or do I have to change settings on my Discord? 2) Am I seeing this chat or message icon only because I‚Äôm using the mobile app, and the game controller shows up on the desktop version? Thanks for answering and for all the hard work you do.

Content: HI David! You nailed the answer actually! It shows up as a cartoon bubble on iOS and as a game controller on laptop/desktop. üôÇ You can find your DMs and incoming DM requests there. You can customize your settings to allow all messages or to require your manual approval first (those go in pending requests and show up easier once you actually have one).

Content: Another quick tip: You can tap on anyone's avatar anywhere in the server to quickly send them a DM.

Content: Ophelia: The response you just typed does not appear in the bubble icon. It only shows up in this general support qs screen. The same has been true with other answers to questions. There is nothing in the bubble except a message I sent to a member of the campaign. Is that how it should be or is there a setting I need to change? It‚Äôs fine if discussions show up in various channels but it would be helpful if DMs showed up in the DM icon and I got notification of answers. Thanks.

Content: That's how it should be. You come here in the server chat rooms and forums. Chat rooms/forums are the ones with # < these hashtags in front of them in the sidebar menu. This is the server. The chat bubble you're seeing is for private DMs (direct messages) where users can send private messages to one another outside this server, but still in the discord app. 

We also have a great intro to discord video here for learning your way around here:

Content: And <#1268398483841220649> and <#1268398608097476750> are also great for getting oriented to how this server works.

Content: Thanks. The video is helpful. Lots to learn, after learning Slack for Biden Harris 2020, so I‚Äôm making efficient use of Discord.

Content: I learned by: focus/hone in on one particular category first then once I'm comfortable, try another.

Content: Also getting your notification settings right will help drown out the noise. There's something on that in <#1268744171980853248>
