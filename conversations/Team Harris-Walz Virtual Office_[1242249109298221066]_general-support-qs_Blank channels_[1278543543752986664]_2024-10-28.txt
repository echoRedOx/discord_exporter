Content: Under Server Guide > Resources, the Community Guidelines and Channel Guide are blank except for emoji reactions. Same with 2 channels in Orientation category: <#1242809422481195018> and <#1274062346272117028> . Any idea why these aren't displaying any text? All the other channels seem fine. Thanks

Content: Okay I'm going to give you the online engagement role. This does not affect you work here. It's just that the onboarding is expecting you to pick something on that screen.

Content: You're probably fine, you may want to revisit Channels & Roles after you decide what kind(s) of actions you want to participate in.

Content: Could you remove me from the "online engagement" role? I can't find a way to undo it, and I keep getting notifications and recommendations for it even though I muted the channel and category. Thanks
