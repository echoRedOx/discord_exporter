When I try, the system only lets me add an avatar if I sign up for paid Nitro which I don’t want to do. I want a free avatar. Thanks."

Click on your profile then click on the discord guy then click edit profile then click on the discord guy and you will see a pencil. This is on desktop. it is similar on mobile.

Which option gets me free avatars? I’m using an iPad."

I’m not sure what you mean by free avatars, though."

Carolyn just clarified put something in my photo library and upload it (option 1). Thanks.
