Content: so first off all, it wasn't a snitch hotline, it was a question hotline, for people who had questions about a covid, which as we can all remember, there were a Lot. Calling it a snitch line is a gross mistatement of an effort to help people who are feel more comfortable making direct phone calls, like many in the elderly population.

Content: I don't know what to say about the morgue except that one building to tackle a possible catastrophe seems like a wise choice, even if it ultimately ended up costing the state  ~1 million. It was sold to a midwest trucking company.

Content: Math and reading scores are down nationwide as schools are still recovering from the pandemic. Walz signed a bill to give kids breakfast and lunch at school, in order to help kids learn at school. Christopher Columbus?! That disease-spreading conman has been on a pedestal for 400 years! There's plenty of other people (of all ethnic backgrounds) who deserve the light.

Content: Ok so the flag was racist AND it was also hard to read - take it from a Chicagoan, having a flag that people want to put on cozies, t-shirts, or even get tattooed on their bodies is the epitome of positive branding.

Content: Source of the "snitch line" appears to be a recent article on Breitbart.  Breitbart admits that this was in the very early days of the pandemic when the hysteria was at its height  (March 2020).  The Minnesota Reformer, wrote: Walz has said that while his executive order grants him powers to fine or jail people who violate the stay-home order, his administration is telling police departments to warn people rather than issue citations. Violations carry penalties of up to a $1,000 fine or 90 days in jail.

The city of Edina cited such complaints when it decided to further restrict use of public spaces because residents were not adhering to social-distancing guidelines.

This was in the VERY FIRST weeks of the pandemic.  So yes, there was a hotline, but I haven't seen any reports about arrests or what happened.

Content: Morgue story appears to be true, as well.  It was early days, the first months of the crisis; it was never used and was sold a year later.

Content: A good background on the take down of the statue in Minnesota is here in the Smithsonian magazine. It's backstory about Native Americans around the country pulling down these statues. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/meet-the-indigenous-activist-who-toppled-minnesotas-christopher-columbus-statue-180979488/

Content: He did not "authorize" it apparently. It happened after the George Floyd protests, apparently.

Content: Rest of it is pretty much what I would call "exquisite propaganda"  -- Allegations and assertions that are cherrypicked and presented without context to convey a message.  For example in 2022, 120,555 moved INTO the state. 

Google's AI summary on the matter: In 2022, Minnesota's population grew by 1.0%, or 59,733 residents, due to net international migration. This was the result of 120,500 people moving into the state and 124,300 moving out.
