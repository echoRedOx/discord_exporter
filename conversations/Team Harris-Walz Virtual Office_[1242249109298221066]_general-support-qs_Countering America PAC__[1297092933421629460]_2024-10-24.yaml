  content: "<@371398908695281669> - (Mod Note: I understand your intent is to condemn\
    \ the PAC, which is great.  We cannot include the link though, so I removed that.)\
    \  Your original question is below. \n\n Elon Musk's Super PAC, America PAC, is\
    \ offering $47 ($100 in PA) to people each time a voter they refer signs his petition\
    \ supporting the First and Second Amendment. This is part of an aggressive get-out-the-vote\
    \ drive he is doing to elect Trump. He also recently started hosting town halls\
    \ in PA where he spread widely debunked falsehoods about Dominion.\n\nContext\
    \ aside, I'm wondering how we can specifically counter his PAC given it offers\
    \ a substantial incentive? One idea I had that I wanted to run by mods was getting\
    \ folks in this Discord who live in the swing states to sign the petition and\
    \ then encourage them to donate the money to Kamala's campaign. From my perspective,\
    \ this is totally legitimate if the signees do support those amendments (which\
    \ I assume will have broad, if not universal, support for most cases) .  I, for\
    \ one, completely support the Constitution, and find it beyond puzzling that Elon\
    \ has this petition to support the candidate who threatened to \"terminate\" it."

  content: <@371398908695281669> - This is a great question. I recommend sending that
    feedback directly to the campaign. Thank you for your thoughtfulness on this issue.
