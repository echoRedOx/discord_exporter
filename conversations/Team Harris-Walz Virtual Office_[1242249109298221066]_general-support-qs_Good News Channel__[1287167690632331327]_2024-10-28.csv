I was just wondering if there is a channel dedicated to spreading good news about the campaign and victories in general. If not I thought I would suggest it. Maybe once a week HQ could write a post discussing what the campaign and/or our efforts here as volunteers for the campaign have achieved the past week.

Just thought it would be nice to have and really motivating for all of us, as I know it can be easy to lose hope, especially for phonebankers who went through some rough calls."
