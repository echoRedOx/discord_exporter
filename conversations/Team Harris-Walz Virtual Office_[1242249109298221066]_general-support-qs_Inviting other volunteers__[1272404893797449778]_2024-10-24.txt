Content: I'm part of a group of Harris supporters. Is it ok for me to invite folks from there to this discord server? Or do they need to take one of the trainings first?

I also have the same question about inviting folks to the Reach site

Content: you're welcome to invite them!

If they'd like to take the training they're more than welcome since it covers how to use the server - but you can send them the invite.

Content: We need them all! Send them over to Mobilize and have them sign up! And if they live in a battleground state or very close to one, tell them to go for that too if they can.

Content: Suzi, I got you. Mobilize is an online sign-up site that the DNC along with many state party offices and left-leaning & grassroots organizations use to get volunteers to sign up. Here is the link to the DNC's as an example (and send it to your friends) https://events.democrats.org/

Content: Thanks for the info! Just FYI, I personally found this site a bit overwhelming when I first went to it, as due to it's organization by date it was kind of hard to find out what sorts of opportunities were available--so it doesn't seem like a great general link for folks first getting started. I'm trying to find out what friends are interested in doing and then sending them specific links to events or trainings in those areas. Is there any way an overview menu could be put together for this site?

Content: You can use the Filters section to search for what you want from canvassing to phone banks, and virtual events. I used to do volunteer recruitment for PA Dems so I know that feature comes in very handy.
