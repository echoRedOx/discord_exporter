People who we identified as voting for Biden in 2020. So likely mostly Dems, some independents, and a few Republicans. 

**The people I’m calling are already voting for Kamala. How can I call undecided voters?**
It's great that they’re voting for Kamala. We’re calling all over the country! These conversations are still important even if they’re already a strong Harris supporter because they could join our volunteer team!

**Why do I keep calling the same person?**
Same name, different number, different person: Many of our lists are in alphabetical order by first name, so you may call multiple “David”s when they’re actually different people
Same person, different number: Sometimes we have multiple phone numbers for the same person. Just say “Sorry for calling again, we had 2 numbers on file and wanted to make sure we were able to reach you!”
