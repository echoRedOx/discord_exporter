    county chair. Just thought I'd mention we won for Obama and we can do it again!
    Also, it is important to tell college students that voter ID laws have changed
    in Ohio. They need to be prepared with an Ohio driver's license, an Ohio state
    ID, or a passport (a couple of other military-related IDs can be used). They can't
    use a phone or utility bill. We want our out-of-state students who are living
    here to be able to vote in Ohio!

  content: I thought Ohio was a lost cause, but recent polls hint at a change. I fear
    putting a Kamala Harris yard sign up in my typical middle-class neighborhood.
    The hate and anger that comes from the people who have Trump yard signs is tangible.
    But I am going to do it anyway! It is too essential, and there is too much at
    stake to let fear of reprisal stop us.

  content: Everyone keeps saying "Ohio is red" but honestly we have always been a
    pretty purple state that is diverse as far as its electorate. Seeing how the votes
    on both Abortion and also on Super Majority dictating the Ohio Constitution, I
    think Ohio has a shot to be turned honestly. Its a no-nonsense state with a lot
    of really amazing people. I think the issue is that many just don't realize the
    things being said by DJT. Lots of voters have just always voted Conservative (like
    regular DeWine Conservative or Kaisch Conservative) forever and belive the "radical"
    heading the left gets. I think that could be changed if we can find a way to point
    out that what DJT is proposing is actually radical.

  content: When people bring up that Democrats are to blame for Ohios problems or
    for any bad policy that happens inside Ohio, I always point out that Ohio is a
    Republican Trifecta state (IE ALL the power in this state is in the hands of the
    GOP - Governor, House Majority, Senate Majority) and that it has been for 26+
    years. If we have problems in Ohio or "want change" then supporting the Democratic
    Party/Harris would be that change - not voting for more of the same. I also mention
    that with 26+ years of complete control, shouldn't Ohio be a Republican utopia?

    hopefully they will take a serious look at the topic and come up with things that
    are good for farmers.

  content: A recap of 2025 if that helps you in regard to that. Farms will not be
    allowed to have Federal and Private crop insurance, insurance subsidies lowered
    to 46% instead of 60% and will ONLY be allowed for farms GROSSING under $500k
    a year. My daughter married into a farm that does popcorn for the largest companies
    out there. They have 40k acres. Obviously it's easy for them to see why not to
    vote Trump but I keep running into the little guys that vote based solely on their
    hobby farms.

    However, voters cannot present their Ohio State ID that would reside in the Apple

    this has already been posted I apologize for the duplicate.  Please share with

  content: Just making sure folks have heard about LaRose's latest directive - He
    is unhappy that he lost a court case and needs to allow more people to return
    ballots for folks with disability, so he has directed that no one may put another
    person's ballot in a drop box.  Per this directive, if you are dropping of the
    ballot of a family member or disable person, you need to go inside the board of
    elections and sign a form affirming that you are permitted to submit the ballot
    for them.

  content: Hi Anna, it would be wonderful to get a lot of signatures, so I encourage
    you to share a description of this change page instead of the link. The link is
    a problem because the change.org page asks for financial support which means we
    would be breaking campaign finance law by sharing it here.

    distributed across ideological lines) rather than whichever politicians are in
    power at the time to debate/discuss/take feedback/draw and come to a consensus
    on redistricting. A No vote would keep things as they are now which is described
    fairly well here: https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/ohio/?cycle=2020&level=Congress&startdate=2022-03-02'

  content: 'Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House
    with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from
    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
    MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks
    is crucial.
