I’m in my 70’s and new to Twitter, really only using it because so many of the media clips in Discord are from Twitter. Every time Twitter launches in the app the sound is muted. I looked online and and also in the app help can’t find a solution and wondered if someone could help."

And are you trying to listen to videos posted on Twitter, or are you trying to listen to Twitter Spaces. If you aren't sure that's fine too."

I’m clicking on links in discord and it takes me to Twitter, but the video is always muted and I have to find the video button which is not always obvious and click on it. Even when I open Twitter in the app and there’s a video that pops up, it’s always muted."

You can unmute by tapping on the lower-right corner of any video. I am looking for an automatic way to do this in the app."

I couldn’t find anything either. The problem is that volume button doesn’t always show up and I really have to poke around literally until it pops up. it’s OK once the campaign is over. I’m not gonna be on Twitter anymore. Thank you again.
