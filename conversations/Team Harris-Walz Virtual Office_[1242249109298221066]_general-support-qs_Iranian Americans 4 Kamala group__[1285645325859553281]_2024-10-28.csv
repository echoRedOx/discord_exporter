It is hard to get her to focus on politics but I try every election cycle.  She has said about 1/2 her Iranian American friends and family are for Trump and 1/2 for Harris.  Anyone know of an Iranian American for Kamala group with a website or social media site I can direct her to?  On Mobilize I found a DNC event Iranian Americans 4 Kamala phone banking but no link to a group.  I need something I can share with her that details why Harris will be better for Iranian American concerns than Trump.  Ideas, suggestions.  If there is a different channel I should ask this in, please let me know.  Thank you."

There's also this new clip with JD Vance, talking about deportations of millions of people: https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/post/DAJVieiMdRE. Lastly, from a new NT Times editorial by Charles Blow: â€œLast year, the Trump adviser Stephen Miller bragged on [Twitter]: â€˜We started a new denaturalization project under Trump. In 2025, expect it to be turbocharged.â€™ In his post, he linked to a 2020 New York Times article reporting on the creation of a Justice Department section that would â€˜strip citizenship rights from naturalized immigrants, a move that gives more heft to the Trump administrationâ€™s broad efforts to remove from the country immigrants who have committed crimes.â€™ Revoking the citizenship of naturalized Americans whoâ€™ve committed serious crimes may sound like common sense to Trump and some of his supporters, but itâ€™s a slippery slope."" https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/opinion/trump-haitians-immigration-springfield.html"
