  content: This is just an update for phonebank staff because I am living in the Atlanta,
    GA area. Please continue to encourage volunteers who are potentially contacting
    voters in Florida and Georgia to be sensitive and aware that those in this region
    have the hurricane and related weather on their minds. Both states have declared
    states of emergency for those affected and schools as far north as metro Atlanta
    have been closed Thursday and Friday to keep everyone safe on the roads during
    this time. Please remove this post as needed or share information somewhere else.
    (I wasn't sure where was best to post this as it wasn't really a phone banking
    question.) Thanks so much for reaching out to voters and volunteers and getting
    out the vote!

    eliminated Climate Change from Science Texts back in June. This is an excellent
    time to call folks.
