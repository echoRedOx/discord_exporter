Content: LMK if you find anything and I will do the same. I know the SD NOW chapter met at the Mission Valley library last week but I wasn't able to make it. I will check their website to see if they have any new info.

Content: Sounds great! I signed up as a volunteer for the SD DNC but haven't heard anything. I figured it would be bigger in a few weeks
