    re making him wait 15 days for a new discord. I believe he got trained this past\
    \ Thursday, and he has texted for the Biden campaign before. Is there anything\
    \ we can do to help him start texting now or do we just have to wait the two weeks?\
    \ Thank you \U0001F44C"

  content: Hello <@422535566697955329> I am so sorry your friend deleted their account.
    Discord says it takes up to 2 weeks to process that and then the phone will be
    free. If your friend has a family member who doesn't use Discord they can use
    their phone number to complete the verification and get back into this community.
