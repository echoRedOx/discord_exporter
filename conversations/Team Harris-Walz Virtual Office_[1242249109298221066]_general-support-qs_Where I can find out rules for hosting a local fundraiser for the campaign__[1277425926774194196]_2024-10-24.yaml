    as I don't think the mods are necessarily looking at replies to the questions.

  content: Hi Bashaino, Linda is suggesting you make a new question instead of adding
    you message to her question about Hosts. But since I already answered you here
    it isn't necessary to make a new questions. Try reaching out to the campaign office
    with the contact page i shared. Also definitely share your jingle on your social
    platforms with hashtags that will be noticed by the campaign. Someone in the media
    office is more likely to find you that way.
