  content: "Personally, outside of Dem/Harris. focused subreddits like:\n\n- /r/VoteDem\n\
    - /r/Democrats\n- /r/Khive\n- /r/KamalaHarris\n\nI have found that many mainstream\
    \ subs are posting pro-Harris and anti-Trump/Vance content, such as /r/pics, /r/videos,\
    \ /r/Interestingasfuck, /r/adviceanimals (to name a few)\n\nHowever, there typically\
    \ is a blowback to pro-Kamala content.  An effort to push back against people\
    \ complaining about Harris, or people taking the route of \u201CI don\u2019t want\
    \ to see political posts\u201D to try and shut down discussion (and not out of\
    \ legitimate exhaustion from election-related content), would be beneficial.\n\
    \nI also think the posts need to be a little more savvy and not beat the same\
    \ drum over and over, as that seems to instill the fatigue over political posts\
    \ that makes people tune it out. For instance, /r/pics has been showcasing images\
    \ of Harris as a kid, in college, things that get you more familiar with Harris\
    \ without overly \u201Cpolitical\u201D rhetoric."

  content: So a more coordinated effort might help tighten up the messaging? Could
    that look like the Twitter community notes channel, where people could share posts
    from their targeted subs, and the discord vols could up or downvote, sort of to
    brigade on Reddit for good instead of evil?

  content: "I think the messaging on reddit should be to let organic, specialized\
    \ content shine through, disarm trolls with facts, and build on any Harris support\
    \ mentioned by introducing the idea of volunteering, donating, and other GOTV\
    \ messaging.\n\nFor example, I see many comments under pro-Harris or anti-Trump\
    \ posts that just say \u201CVote\u201D. We should be adding a comment below that\
    \ which adds on a message of the importance of also \u201Cvolunteering and donating\u201D\
    \ and give links to mobilize (maybe not direct links to donate, as it isn\u2019\
    t allowed on many subs).\n\nI also think there are many ways to spread the word\
    \ on Harris\u2019 platform and things like the impacts of Project 2025 on more\
    \ specialized subs that may not have political content. Think the anti-national\
    \ park points in p2025, which can be posted in any local or regional subreddit\
    \ and be extremely relevant to the user\u2019s interests. These posts should be\
    \ natural and stick to the type of content usually posted in these subs, and compelling\
    \ enough to the sub\u2019s user-base that it doesn\u2019t just read like an out-of-place\
    \ political campaign ad.\n\nAs vote brigading isn\u2019t allowed on reddit, I\
    \ don\u2019t think that should be pushed as an official message or tactic.  But\
    \ sharing posts in a dedicated channel is a really good idea, if only to get others\
    \ to see the discourse on reddit, learn the effective tactics being used to support\
    \ the campaign in posts/comments, and people can individually decide if they want\
    \ to interact if they feel they have a very strong opinion or response in the\
    \ discussion."

    \ usually check it for incorrect information, or as you mentioned, get people\
    \ thinking past the idea of voting and into checking registration, polling place,\
