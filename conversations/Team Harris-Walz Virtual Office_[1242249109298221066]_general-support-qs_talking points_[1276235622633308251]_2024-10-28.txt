Content: I would love to have concise talking points on inflation e.g. gas and food prices to rebut all of these false narratives and memes. The research articles are long and winding, I would love to have accurate bullet points.

Also a rejoinder to why Harris has changed her tune on things like fracking

Content: I think in general, I'd love to see "lead by example" - where for every meme and/or talking point, it's annotated with links to the source. 

The folks in the middle question. We WANT them to question, but we also need to be able to answer in a consistent, on message manner with sources documented. This is more relevant to social media/meme sharing in terms of links.

Content: On gas prices, one thing that resonated with my family was reminding them of past prices. Regular Gasoline hit $4.50ish/gallon in Orange County, CA back in 2007 right before the Great Recession. In 2024, nearly 20 years later, gas prices are up to… $4.50ish/gallon. And that’s with increased gas taxes, higher wages, and more environmentally-friendly fuel blends.
Here’s a graph of the past few years, if I can find a longer-term chart that would resonate even more: https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/economics-markets/article/55042241/eia-us-gasoline-prices-ahead-of-memorial-day-weekend-1-higher-than-last-year

Content: On food, similar thing, point out overreaction to spikes but no mainstream media talking about prices going back down. For me, Costco eggs were $4.99/2 dozen a few years ago, spiked about 1.5 years ago to $8.99, and are back to $4.99. Even during that period, I paid $4-$8/month more for eggs. Relative to even my WiFi bill, that’s a tiny amount.

Content: Hi Joyce! The campaign will be announcing its official platform with policy planks (top single issue policy goals) in the coming days after the convention. This campaign is so new and fast and the campaign and DNC have to agree on the platform planks before releasing them. They should be out very soon and, when they are, we will post links here in the server for everyone. Thank you!

Content: Thanks to all of you. I am committed to offering a documented retort to memes and other outrageous statements, I appreciate the feedback. The gas chart is especially helpful. My husband read O &G Journal his whole geophysical career. I did compile the following, in response to why didn’t she do anything in the 3 1/2 years in office. Perhaps it will help you.

I wondered if you could consider this. In the first congressional session after Biden was elected the Dems had control of both chambers and passed a large amount of significant impactful legislation, including: Inflation Reduction Act, American Rescue Plan Act, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Postal Service Reform Act, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, CHIPS and Science Act, Honoring Our PACT Act, Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, and Respect for Marriage Act. 

In the second session, the Dems lost control of the House, and it was described as “uniquely ineffectual Congress, with its most notable events pointing towards political dysfunction. The intense gridlock, particularly in the Republican-controlled House, where the Republican Conference's majority was often undercut by internal disputes amongst its members, resulted in it passing the lowest number of laws for the first year of session since the Richard Nixon administration, and possibly ever”.  

Can’t fix things when Republicans in the house wouldn’t even bring bills to the floor. And then there’s the bipartisan immigration bill which they killed because Trump said so. All things to consider

Content: This website might be helpful. You can search by state to see where the money from the Infrastructure Bill is being used. https://www.americanprogress.org/article/biden-administration-investment-tracker/?bit-query=1&keyword=&federal=on&private=on&min_amount=0&max_amount=35000000000&bit-state=AZ&bit-cd=&city=&law=BIL&company=&bit-page=1#bit-tracker

Content: These are helpful resources, thank you. I agree with <@1275616253397958721> - facts are important. Is there a shared drive or is this space all "threads" under each channel?  Searching threads seems inefficient. I am new to discord, just checking out various channels.

Content: While some teams may go into deeper detail, this forum, <#1267941954243526756>, doesn't. We will be posting the planks once they come out but we aren't going into deep detail past that because we want to be sure whatever we recommend is on message with the campaign and we're prioritizing that messaging.
