If this is your first 2FA you can use Google Authenticator or an app like Duo Mobile. Here is the Discord page explaination https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Multi-Factor-Authentication#h_01J5BFJ9JZEDTA2W83J9TAHG0Z"

Try logging out of Discord on all your device(s). Then log back in on one device and see if you can set up 2FA.
Are you doing the 2FA setup on your phone or desktop?"
