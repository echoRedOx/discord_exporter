Content: Thanks <@1072639754765615237>! It‚Äôs in Upper Marlboro, according to other posts. My mom and mother-in-law are so excited and had hoped to attend as we‚Äôve donated to the campaign and registered to canvass in Charles County on Aug. 24. My mother-in-law did phone bank work for Biden. Not sure how they‚Äôre selecting invitees, but it‚Äôd be wonderful to take my mothers who love Biden and want to see Kamala win.

I‚Äôm interested in setting up a virtual watch party and including my family in Wisconsin who are not consistent voters üôÇ It isn‚Äôt clear to me on the sign up - is the DNC projected on the call by you all or do I need to stream? Is there engagement like chat or people talking or is it like a stream like the DC call today? Thanks!

Content: I believe that it is up to you turn on the tv for the party guests in your home or to run your own zoom/Facetime/other with those who are joining remotely. You are welcome to sign up online. Then you join the proper Discord channel to chat with other hosts. There will be a brief training call on Zoom that you will be emailed about once you register through mobilize. Reminder: make it private if you don‚Äôt want randoms seeing your address or signing up.

Content: Just trying to figure out how to volunteer for door knocking. Live in Montgomery County MD and can maybe canvass PA or VA as needed. I just don‚Äôt see any option for how to sign up. Don‚Äôt find this platform very helpful as I am not a user and find the flood of options to explore on it a bit overwhelming. Call me old.

Content: Not that I‚Äôm aware of except her campaign is using the Empower app which enables you to text your own contacts about the campaign. They provide you with content that the app lets you send through your phone. They are doing a lot of canvassing and calling. I got the Empower app through her website.

Content: You use the QR code for your region in MD and download an app called Empower onto your phone. I haven‚Äôt used Reach, but I think some of the functionality is similar. You can use it to contact your friends and it lets you know about local events.

Content: Hey y'all!  Awesome a Maryland thread.  I'm T from MD.  Been making calls for Alsobrooks.  I am concerned that there have been no virtual events on Mobilize (that i have seen) to do any virtual calls or virtual textbanks for April McClain Delaney.  I receive email messages from her campaign stating how close the race between her and Republican Neil Parrot is for the House Seat.  I feel more online virtual events need to be done to get her elected! Now, that I think about it there's been no textbanking for Angela Alsobrooks either (but lots of phonebanks of which I've been taking part) What does everyone else think?  HarrisWalzLandslide!!  Let's go Maryland!

Content: I canvassed in Severna Park on Saturday for Angela Alsobrooks and a BOE candidate Dana S. I also wish there was texting, too. That's the easiest for me to do, but phone banking and canvassing are the most impactful so I see how they might just be focused on that.

Content: Well i saw events listed that Delaney is going to be at Montgomery College & Labor Day Parade I believe.  I'm talking specifically about textbanks/phone banks to voters for her.  I have to do virtual events.  I know there are events in person to door knock etc on her and Angela Alsobrooks behalf.  I'm just concerned about lack of virtual opportunities to support her for everyone who can't be at an in person gathering.  Also, Just saw email that Alsobrooks is tied w/ Hogan. Eeeek! üò¶  Does anyone know if there will be a debate b/t Delaney & parrot?  I know i read there will be b/t Hogan and Alsobrooks. i forget when. will have to check.

I did hear he is totally anti-choice& apparently extreme.  sigh.  Don't want him in the House! That seat needs to stay BLUE. And don't want Hogan in Senate.

Content: my dad pointed out there was an alsobrooks ad on tv last night. idk what station. so that's good.  I just got an invite from MD DEMS asking me to join the montgomery college rally. I msged the person back requesting they add virtual options for these rallies/speaking engagements for those who can't go out to events as well as adding textbanking for Delaney & phonebanking. they should do textbanking for Alsobrooks too! I hope he passes that request on. Mail in ballot voting will begin possibly 20th Sept- Oct 5th . maybe they are textbanking at in person locations or calling. idk. but there are none for supporters to do virtually for Delaney except one virtual phonebank I participated in & imo it was like Delaney was an afterthought as far as communicating it to voters. does anyone know when & how to watch Hogan alsobrooks debate & is there 1 for Delaney & Parrot.

Content: I looked at Bluevoter guide someone had shared a link to earlier today on here & the concept is very cool. but its missing the 2nd ballot  question on reducing  county exec terms.  at a recent meeting, some Dems seemed to say that was put on ballot by Republicans & to vote against the measure. if that is the case- they need to get the msg out to the public immediately. bc otherwise it's like oh term limits make sense look at supreme court etc. super impt that they inform Marylanders if they do want us to vote against that cuz 8 had no idea.

Content: There has been a lot of combined campaign canvassing events. There is usually at least one a week out of Crofton and multiple out of Annapolis. I haven't seen as many yard signs or anything like that which is unfortunate. I went canvassing back in early August and was surprised at how many people had never even heard of her. The Annapolis office just ramped up some phone banking events, they are almost daily for Harris and Alsobrooks.

Content: I went door knocking for Alsobrooks in Baltimore City yesterday.  We encountered people who didn't know anything about the Senate campaign, but committed to voting for Alsobrooks after we spoke with them.  We left door hangers where people didn't answer.  These could help overcome Hogan's name recognition.   I'd encourage everyone to try to find some time to do this in your area.

Content: good! i am concerned there aren't enough textbanks to Maryland at all! and phonebanks. especialy for district 6. that Parrot is running for a congressional HOUSE seat that was held by Dem David Trone.  Delaney is running against him but i'm very concerned as there seem to be no phonebanks for her really.  and i don't see any national effort for phonebanks etc to MD. üò¶  they have redistricted 06 and lumped Dems in w a bunch of Republican voters!!

Content: I really object to them doing that. to me, that takes away MoCo county's voices b/c they split up the county and attached part of it to Western counties-Garrett, Allegany, Washington (and Frederick) but Frederick isn't so western. but the other 3-apparently pretty heavily republican as far as i've heard. So to split up MoCo and attached part of it to these Western MD counties isn't right, imo.

Content: Delaney‚Äôs district is always caught up in redistricting battles. For years, an awful older man (Tea Party, anti-ACA, reproductive rights, etc.) was our Congressman. The last I saw, Delaney is trailing behind! I don‚Äôt see a lot of Democratic resources for her, but I plan to start canvassing for both her and Alsobrooks on Saturday. We no longer have a local newspaper and there is little information about the Republican, Parrott. But I know from 2022 that he is quite extreme and will not be a friend to ordinary voters.

Content: yeah sadly that's my district & I'm none too pleased that it's suddenly a "competitive" district. Good job, <@1202478087753830430>  I've been getting emails from Delaneys campaign. Parrot is completely anti-abortion EVEN IN CASES OF RAPE OR INCEST.  He voted to WEAKEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS. I AM IN A VERY BLUE AREA. CANNOT BELIEVE AN EXTREME REPUBLICAN COULD REPRESENT US. AND IT'S A HOUSE SEAT TOO. I'm really not seeing any fundraising msgs or many digital virtual opportunities to call on her behalf & have seen no texting on her behalf. I can only do virtual, not in person.

Content: Thanks for your information. I am going to the Poolesville Day Parade on Saturday and then I‚Äôll go to learn canvassing in Frederick or Damascus. As I learn the talking points, I willing to canvass in the redder areas of the district. We are attached to much of western Maryland, which is aggravating. Her husband self-funded and got a fair amount of attention-but that was in a differently drawn district and when we still had local newspapers (not to be redundant, but it is such a problem to not have one during elections).

Content: Nothing fancy-their were many Gazettes: Gaithersburg & Germantown Gazettes were the ones that covered local news quite well. Local schools, politics and other news. We didn‚Äôt realize how much we depended on them for local election decisions until we were in the ballot booth with a lot of candidate choices and  realizing we had no information. ü§Ø

Content: You request it but what's great is that you don't have to request it every primary/election.  They have a "permanent Mail-in ballot list".  We travel a lot so we just don't want to take the chance we don't receive it in the mail or aren't in town on Election Day

Content: afaik Hogan alsobrooks & delaney parrot are the close ones & I feel not enough attention has been paid. glad it seems within last couple days there has been some more effort at I guess a national level to do increased voter outreach to our state for Alsobrooks. But haven't seen much outreach for ppl to vote Delaney. which concerns me. no other MD races are close correct?  I haven't seen reporting of any.

Content: Graphic artists can apply to join the team called Kamala's Content Brigade. It has its own Discord server. This vetted group of volunteer graphic artists and video editors/animators makes some of the content you see here and in reach. There's a Google form to fill out/apply. Maybe ask in @general-support if you're interested.

Content: I spoke with the Maryland BoE last week which confirmed they would start mailing ballots imminently, but that it would take a while to mail the ballots to everyone who has already requested one because of the sheer volume. Mine was delivered by mail yesterday. They have already installed the 286 ballot drop boxes -- so people are voting now.

Content: Is it ok to share a campaign that we started over at Field Team 6 here?  Its a sticky note campaign to help share to voters, especially women, that their votes are private so they feel they can vote their convictions without their partner or family member knowing.  I'll wait to make sure its ok before sharing here.

Content: my dad says he's seeing a lot of anti Alsobrooks ads on tv. (I don't watch much TV these days but turn it on once in a while in the morning to see political ads haha. I am seeing a number against Hogan but also saw a couple against alsobrooks. I may try 2 keep an eye on which over the air shows what. like nbc has some against him. this morning my local ABC SINCLAIR affiliate had one against her. finally saw 1 against Hogan. have seen ZERO for Delaney at all & I don't think my dad has either.  but maybe they're targeting ads to more republican areas of the state? idk. I asked if he saw any for kamala. he said maybe a couple. ppl are voting here already mail in ballots. I wonder why barely any ads for harris? or...maybe targeting Republican areas...then again someone in neighborhood has parrot sign & previously had Trump sign so..

Content: Hey, Marylanders -- **Angela Alsobrooks'  Baltimore HQ reached out to me yesterday. They really need more canvassers leading up to Nov 5!**  If you live within a reasonable drive of Charm City, please find a time slot that works for you and come help get out the vote in this very Blue city!  

**Hogan treated Bmore shabbily and was never popular here -- he lost here in 2018 by a huge margin.**  Getting out the Bmore vote could make the difference in keeping the Senate blue!

Content: I sent this to several members of my network. Please be aware that this isn't visible through www.mobilize.us/mdvictory - and this is the link that goes out in MD Dems & the individual campaign emails & texts. That might have an impact on low sign-ups.

Content: I went ahead and voted the other day. but I am so appalled that there is no info on judges' views & they are in office for 10 to 15 years. I did my best to do due diligence and then I did my ballot. but there is a HUGE PROBLEM. there isn't info on county or circuit court judges'  views.  general info on them & their general answers to unimportant questions does nothing. it's NUTS. it's like a secret. I hope ppl who are on a position do something about this so voters can be informed.we as voters are not informed or provided with info in order to vote on judges! I found it utterly unacceptable.

Content: I wish they would do more drives out away from the campaign offices, or even tabling with signs to give away.  Germantown specifically may not be far from the Gaithersburg office, depending on where exactly people are, but there are definitely people nowhere close to offices who also aren't going to buy signs üòï

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: I already voted and it says received, so yay! waiting for it to be counted.  But i was super disappointed in that there's no info about the judges (both MoCo circuit court & statewide appellate court judges) and those ppl get 10 to 15 YEAR terms. i tried to ask a number of organizations and found out nothing. but like, we don't know if judges are pro choice or their views...finally voted after seeing i wouldn't be able to get anywhere with that. county dems are reccomending to vote for all the appellate and circuit county courts...if anyone knows more info on those judges' views or reasons ppl should not vote for them, i will try to spread the msg.  it's nuts we don't get info on ppl who serve for so many years!

Content: your ballot was counted already?! nice!  mine was received. waiting to hear that it's counted.  also-why what do other states say that make it less clear? and personally I find the board of elections website kinda confusing.  and you kind of have to search around before you find the "track ballot," tab.  also ppl who might know- does ballot received just mean they took the envelope w signature off the ballot and they have put your ballot somewhere? but they have not scanned it/looked at what you voted yet? i was wondering that. b/c since it's sposed to be anonymous, hopefully they separate it from the envelope without looking at the vote....

Content: Good Morning my fellow Marylanders! I'm in AACO and am going to early vote today. On the sample ballot I got, I noticed that I am voting for some judges for the Circuit Court and Appellate Court. Are there any good resources to look up these judges and their records? Thanks!

Content: This is a big weekend of action for Angela Alsobrooks! The polls show Angela in the lead, but that doesn't matter if we can't bring out the vote! In 2014, Hogan was down by 9 in 2014 & won by 5, so we can't underestimate him. Lots of canvassing and phone banking shifts available:

Content: That's the exact problem i ran into. Dem sample ballot says to vote for the appellate and circuit court (montgomery county) judges. BUT i read the GOP sample ballot (saw it) reccs the exact same thing!  so.....that was  a major concern to me-wanted to know these judges' views on things! but any site that asked them questions were general stuff-didn't enhance my knowledge of their views on important things like pro repro freedom, democracy etc.  That is a MAJOR FLAW imo that we voters are not being informed about judicial candidates who serve 10 to 15 yr terms! did what i could to ask organizations-got no answers. bluevoterguide did say who appointed them. shrug. Dems really need to start educating us on these impt judicial appointments!

Content: Not "they", he.  This was Bezos personally killing the already drafted endorsement of Kamala by the editorial staff.  The Editor-at-large, Robert Kagan, resigned in protest and I posted that I will follow him anyway he lands in journalism or social media because of that moral courage.

Content: So, there's a reason we're asking you to call, and it's because the campaign is asking us to make that ask because it's important. Phone banking is the single most effective thing we can do to get Kamala elected outside of knocking on doors. It's critical. We wouldn't be asking you to do it if there weren't a real, serious need to get people to call. I understand that chatting in a discord server is a lot more comfortable - and probably a lot more fun - and we really appreciate the community folks have built here, but at the end of the day, this server exists to steer people towards volunteerism. In this moment, with ten days left, that means calling. There are many, many other servers for political discourse. This one is for volunteering and for connecting people with volunteer positions.

Content: Good afternoon, <@&1245910503457558672> ! I'm here because campaign staff are asking us to see if folks in state channels might be willing to make some calls today towards our 10 million calls goal. Frances and other HQ staff have explicitly requested that mods post here. (As has been the case every other time we've posted!) We know you have an incredible senate candidate (loved her DNC speech! so powerful!) but, as this is the national campaign server, we're politely asking that if folks have some extra time today or in the coming week, you join us in <#1242256751445934262> (if you don't have this, go to <id:customize> and select "talk to voters in key states") or head [straight to the dialer ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=9ccd3f9e-fa00-4de0-8919-eef3896d1a0d&ref=natl_dis_host_discordveveryoneelse) to make some calls. We are here at the finish line, and GOTV in swing states is going to be absolutely critical to our success. We'd love to see you over there supporting this effort. Thanks, all!

Content: yes bluevoterguide.org warned me about Diaz! i wouldn't have known otherwise!  Finally MD Dems seem to be tweeting about the school board candidates. Judges are hard-bluevoterguide does say who appointed them-my issue is-both Dem and GOP are recommending voting for all judges on BOTH their sample ballots.  I'm like, why? I did my best, hope Dems have advised well, but as i lamented in prior posts, we don't know about these judges' opinions on Pro-choice, medical aid in dying, democracy, so many issues etc.  Their interview answers tell you nothing as far as I'm concerned.  Dems/Independents really need to start informing US so we are knowledgeable about ppl whose positions last 10-15 year terms! It's nuts, imo not to inform voters.  Now that I am paying attention closely locally in this election, I became aware of this!

Content: I also wish the voting for judges thing was different; unfortunately, the way it works right now in the state, anyone can put their name forward to be a judge and be on the ballot (regardless of experience, don't even have to be a lawyer), so by voting for sitting judges, we're voting for people who at least have some semblance of an idea of what they're doing üôÇ

Content: yeah but look at who's on Supreme Court. They have a semblance of what they're doing too, but look how dangerous the majority is! So, i feel they are asking us to vote with no info on these ppl. And now it is clear how impt Judges can be regarding everything. So idk why there's no effort made to educate the voters!  I am so glad either someone on this site or Field Team 6 posted bluevoterguide so i learned about that resource back when i was researching and trying to find out stuff. at least it informed me about school board.  But how they do things needs to change imo! Very flawed.

Content: Every election we've had for the past 3 cycles have been desperately vital, and I'm really quite sick of it.  I disagreed with McCain and Romney on a great many things, but I never viewed them as existential threats.  Even when he started running back in 2015 I viewed Trump as an existential threat.  It's going on a decade of this crap, and I'm tired, boss.

Content: They at least cared about preserving cultural norms and maintaining the decorum of the presidency.  The president had, until 2016, essentially been expected to conduct himself as one of, if not THE, most dignified Americans.  Once Trump waddled into the Oval office and began debasing himself on a daily basis, it essentially gave everyone else in permission to behave as their worst selves too.  He is, after all the most dignified among us by virtue of being the president.

Content: that's why sometimes I think his followers like even on 1/6- some of them anyway, almost can't be blamed-not that they shouldn't be punished-but ppl EXPECT A PRESIDENT TO BE HONEST AND TELL THE TRUTH (MOSTLY) TO THE AMERICAN PPL. AND HE'S BROKEN THAT RULE. HE LIES. HE PROJECTS. HE GASLIGHTS, along w most of his fellow GOP in congress. before him, I thought Presidents were pretty much honest, you know?

As someone w/disabilities, that is DANGEROUS. and that was in OUR STATE.

Content: You're talking about a group of people who are used to being led around by the nose by people like Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Glenn Beck before them.  They do not crave honesty - the people they follow are demonstrable liars (no reasonable person would consider Fox to be news, according to the lawsuit).  Trump just gives them what they want.

So they didn't think the president would LIE TO THEM.  and now i listen to bits of what trump and vance say in speeches on cspan occassionaly, and they are saying Kamala's a dictator, a fascist etc, everything that TRUMP is. and for ppl who don't know, they probably hear both sides calling each other the same thing and don't know what to beliveve. I was texting today-for 4 hours for reproductive freedom for all. i literraly got a reply from a Marylander who said everyone lies, it's hard to know what to believe, so they weren't voting. That's exactly what Trump, Vance majority of GOP & the current owner of Twitter, have done. I myself see things and don't always know what's true.  So anyway Idk if it will have an impact, but i messaged the person back and told them i understand it can be difficult to tell, but that their vote is important, and told them Kamala stands for democracy, women's rights & constitution, but trump wants a dicatorship and to implement project 2025 and take away our freedoms and right to control our body and likely our ability to vote. and asked them to vote. so...that's all you can do.

Content: Here's the thing though - they're not wrong. In every campaign there are inaccuracies on both sides.  It's impossible to get everything 100% correct over a campaign cycle.  Even when you campaign with honest and noble intentions, mistakes happen. Facts and figures can be interpreted one way or another, and even accurate statements can be interpreted as lies under the right circumstances. Now add a 24x7 news cycle, pundits, podcasts, twitter, Facebook and everyone on the planet sharing their (usually dumbass) opinions all the time, yeah, it's really easy to get it in your head that everyone lies and there's no point in participating in government.  That, in a democracy, is simply not an option. Playing the "bOtH sIdEs tHe SaMe" card is lazy and counterproductive.  If you don't like either side, then it's your duty as a citizen to pick the side you like best, get involved, and work until you do like it. A democratic system of government was never designed for the citizenry to be hands off, but that's how we've come to treat it in the US.  So many people pay no attention and do nothing for 3.5 years, then moan and complain every general election cycle because they don't like the candidates or the party platform or whatever.

Content: I did not have any state judges on my ballot, just local ones.  The Maryland Supreme Court has seven justices because the state is divided into seven appellate judicial circuits, and each circuit has its own justice.  I'm guessing that each region votes for their own seat:

Content: i had the circuit court judges and the 3 appellate court judges on my ballot. but not any supreme court justices...i read the map you posted and what you wrote, I guess i don't really understand what it means... also the appellate court are for the whole state i thought. while circuit court was MoCo circuit court (on mine). but still don't get the supreme court thing-or you mean the state supreme court has justices from diff counties ? and maybe MoCo's justices on supreme court weren't the ones up for reelection?? but state appellate court justices are...shrug, shakes head. confused. lol

Content: basically I'm just guessing that while 3 of the state supreme court justices may be up for re-election, one of them is not the one from the 7th appellate, so that's not on our ballot.  But I'm not really sure.  I'm no expert

Proposal 1

New York Proposal 1, Equal Protection of Law Amendment (2024)

A "yes" vote supports adding language to the New York Bill of Rights to provide that people cannot be denied rights based on their "ethnicity, national origin, age, and disability" or "sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy."

Content: Just wanted to say how much I appreciate everyone in this channel - in addition to the judges chat last night, I was following along with the conversation while I was phone-banking out to AZ, and you all made me so grateful and hopeful for your commitment to making change here in Maryland at the same time as we make change nationally, and for not being complacent just because of where we live.

Content: As a parent that was one of the things he did that I hated the most. Every study out there shows that the longer your summer break, the more kids forget and the more time needs to be spent rehashing last year's material. And for what?  To make the summer tourism season "longer"?  News flash Larry, just because you make school start later doesn't mean I can afford a second week of vacation.  In fact, it makes it harder because I need to pay for an extra 2 weeks of camps for my kids ($350 a pop) because school starts later now.

Content: If we got rid of summr vacations all together and split them into four 2-week breaks (and made a few other schedule adjustments to even out the 180 days) you could effectively increase the effectiveness of the US school public school system by 25-50% without spending an additional dime.

Content: Biden admin/gov't needs to classify some of what's happening imo as national security threat, and take action, to protect us.  We need Biden admin to protect us from the Court, from Trump, from billionaire owners of social media platforms etc.  i don't understand and haven't why what's happening hasn't been labelled as national security threat and handled in that vein.

Content: Our Community Guidelines unite us with a shared commitment to elect VP Kamala Harris to the US presidency. 

This is a volunteer community where we talk about volunteering events and tactics. Importantly, our vision is to create a positive welcoming space for everyone. Pumping each other up & creating a groundswell movement of hope & joy. 

We still have lots of work to do. 

Kamala Harris said: Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past‚Ä¶ this is our ‚Äú‚Ä¶chance to chart a new way forward, not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.‚Äù
