  content: "Hi, Brody!  When you sign up for a phonebank, or when you come here to\
    \ calls-team on Discord, you will be given access to our Dialer.  The Dialer opens\
    \ in a browser window on your computer or tablet.  It searches a list of phone\
    \ numbers for a good connection, then feeds you a call that has already been answered\
    \ on the other end.  The called person sees a local phone number.   So your phone\
    \ service does not have to be involved in the call at all.  There is an option\
    \ to use your own phone for audio, but even in that case you dial  a phone number\
    \ once to connect your audio, and the dialer works as above.  \n\nSo I think the\
    \ short answer to your question is that the Dialer has an integrated VOIP system."
