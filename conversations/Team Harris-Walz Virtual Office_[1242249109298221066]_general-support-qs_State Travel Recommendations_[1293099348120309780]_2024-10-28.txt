Content: Hi,

I'm interested in traveling to a swing state sometime in the week before the election to do in-person canvassing, and I was wondering if there were preferred states for volunteers to go to (e.g. Michigan, Georgia)? Thanks for the help.

Content: Hello <@371398908695281669> depending on where you are and where you want to travel to, I would suggest searching for canvassing opportunities on [mobilize.us](https://www.mobilize.us/?country=US&q=canvass&state=PA). You can type "canvass" in the search box and put the state, city, or zip code in the location box.
