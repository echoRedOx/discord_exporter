  content: I wonder if it is just that there isn't as much that can be done outside
    of a certain window. I know a lot of ppl who are looking for local opportunities
    but aren't getting responses back from local offices. I will dig into who might
    be/ if there are voter registration pushes or other opportunities for people who
    are looking for more in-person community building events.

  content: LMK if you find anything and I will do the same. I know the SD NOW chapter
    met at the Mission Valley library last week but I wasn't able to make it. I will
    check their website to see if they have any new info.
