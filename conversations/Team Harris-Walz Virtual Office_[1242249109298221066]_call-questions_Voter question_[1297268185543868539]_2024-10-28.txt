Content: An NC voter I talked to said she had a friend who requested a PA mail-in ballot and was having difficulties getting one. She said she could give me his # but "he probably won't answer if you call," which I understand. She asked me to note it though, so I am.

Content: We cannot make outbound calls direct to voters so in the future the best course would be to suggest they go to iwillvote.com, select their state and see the instructions there.
