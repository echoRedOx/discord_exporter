  content: 'The script for the phone bank seems to assume I belong to the Democratic
    Party.

    I do not.  I am not affiliated with any party, and I''m typically conservative.


    Is it kosher to start with "I''m calling on behalf of the Democratic Party" instead
    of "I''m WITH the Democratic Party"?

    I think the fact that I do not affiliate with a party is beneficial for my conversation,
    particularly since I usually lean toward conservative.


    What''s the skinny on that?'

    "Hi I''m Thomas, I''m calling on behalf of America. Is this (insert name)"


    That way they get a little bit of me in there, and sometimes if it''s NOT the
    person I''m calling, maybe they''ll still listen instead of immediately hang up?'
