  content: 'New guy here: tonight will be my first time trying the "What is important
    to you?" question before asking who they are voting for. For the last 5 days I''ve
    done this, the script either hasn''t had that part, or else I have just (erroneously)
    skipped it. Is the main goal to find out who they are voting for? In which case,
    I could just go back to my "Hi my name is Pat, I''m a volunteer with Team Harris-Walz
    supporting Democrats in AZ, I know you''re busy and I don''t want to take but
    a few seconds of your time to ask if you are planning to vote this election, and
    if so, will you be supporting Kamala Harris for president?" I am happy to say
    whatever I need to -- I was just trying to avoid hangups by being succinct. Thanks.'

  content: Cool, I guess it's more a tactical question about how best to keep someone
    on the line -- Do you recommend I go with the "What is most important to you this
    election?" question before jumping into the question, "Will you be supporting
    Kamala Harris?"

  content: Honestly, I base which one I say on their level of enthusiasm in their
    voice up to that point. If they seem uninterested, annoyed, or similar, I jump
    right into Will you be supporting Kamala Harris? If not those emotions, I will
    typically try to engage.
