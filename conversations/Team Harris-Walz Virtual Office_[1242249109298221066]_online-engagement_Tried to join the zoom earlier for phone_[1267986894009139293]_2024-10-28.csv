 1) Check your wifi or internet connection. 
 2) If you cannot find the details for your event, check your e-mails or log into the Mobilize website (https://events.democrats.org/) and check your schedule in the menu (top right corner). 
 3) If neither of those work, I recommend submitting a ticket to <#1259167462956597269> and one of our team members will help you get it sorted out!"""
