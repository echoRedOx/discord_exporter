Content: Unfortunately I accidentally closed the tab when I tried to check which campaign, so it's theoretical I guess. It was in Michigan and the woman had already voted for Kamala.

Content: If I understand correctly... it would be "Talking to Correct Person" => "Strong Harris."    We don't yet have a button for already voted.

Content: Also, on the Zoom call yesterday, the facilitator and staff person said we don't act on self-reported voting.  Depending on when states count votes, we may get back-end data that allows us to remove voters from lists, or we may continue to call them for volunteer opportunities.

Content: I was told yesterday that the campaign is pulling voter data daily and updating the calls lists accordingly. So people should be taken off the lists within a few days of voting (depending on the processing time for mail in ballots)
