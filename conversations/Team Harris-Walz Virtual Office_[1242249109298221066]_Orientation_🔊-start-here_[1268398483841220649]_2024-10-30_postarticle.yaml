    \ the action, skip this brief tour around our server and jump straight to <#1268398608097476750>\
    \ for a workflow for what to do right now!)*\n\n**Welcome to the DNC's Team Harris\
    \ Virtual Office discord server team! **And be on the lookout for friendly reminders\
    \ and guidance from our bot we affectionately call DemCord.\n\nWe feel and share\
    \ your excitement and energy to mobilize and help elect Kamala Harris as President,\
    \ Tim Walz as VP, and Democrats up and down the ballot in November (well, really,\
    \ starting in September with early voting). \n\nTo start, tap or click on server\
    \ title in the sidebar (Team Harris-Walz Virtual Office heading). In the dropdown\
    \ menu, select \"Show all channels\" and tap/click anywhere to close. \n\nNow,\
    \ let's take a look at our <id:guide> where you will find our Community Guidelines\
    \ and our detailed Channel Guide. You can alternate between the two by clicking\
    \ or tapping on the tabs for each.\n\nPlease make note of the guidelines and acknowledge\
    \ them with an emoji. Most are the expected norms of kindness and respect. __Note\
    \ rule 3 in particular__. We have a dedicated channel for posting non-official\
    \ events (e.g. mailing postcards, canvassing, GOTV, etc), <#1268426751164551199>,\
    \ and these events are prohibited anywhere else on the server*. Non-official (not\
    \ hosted by the Democratic National Committee) fundraising events are prohibited\
    \ anywhere on this server per campaign finance law. By participating in the server\
    \ you are bound by these guidelines.*\n\nIf you need a mod, please tag <@&1266883962727432304>\
    \ for general assistance.\n\n> **Now for the fun...** \n\nIn the sidebar you'll\
    \ see categories. You're currently in Orientation. Sub-levels below each category\
    \ are the channels within that category. Channels are chat rooms or forums. \n\
    \nClick or tap on a category to collapse or expand it. Click or tap on a channel\
    \ to view and engage where available. Note: You can respond with emojis in channels\
    \ where messages aren't allowed. And if you can't see an expected category yet,\
    \ you'll be added soon!\n\nThere are categories for each mobilizing action like\
    \ our Calls Team and Online Engagement Team. This is where you'll likely spend\
    \ most of your time. Each team has its own instructions in the channel descriptions.\
    \ Once you enter a channel, click or tap on the title bar to read the channel\
    \ description, which will have direction for how to use each channel. You can\
    \ also familiarize yourself with each team's channels here: <#1274062346272117028>.\n\
    \nWe also have loads of resources and are adding more frequently. For instance,\
    \ if you'd like to get current messaging for online engagement, you can visit:<#1250551051002839131>.\
    \ \n\nIf you'd like Content Brigade memes and social media graphics you can post\
    \ to social media, <#1250876565366243348> is a goldmine! (You can also apply to\
    \ be on the Content Brigade team, which has its own server, via the channel description).\
    \ You can even share your own memes--created or seen in the wild--in <#1265762143559618624>.\
    \ \n\nAnd don't forget to <#1242256950402744431> , where all of our server social\
    \ media content and DNC messaging and content are. You can take the two trainings\
    \ for online engagement by registering for an event at https://events.democrats.org.\
    \ \n\nOnce you've gotten settled in with navigating categories and channels, you\
    \ can check out The Stage where staff hosts live viewing parties and major events.\n\
    \nAnd finally, visit <#1268398608097476750> next to see some of the current FAQs\
    \ and a clear, easy pattern for your ongoing action and success! When questions\
    \ come up, you can ask a mod in <#1267941954243526756> or <#1242249109298221069>.\
    \ \n\nThis is a people-powered campaign and we can't get to the White House without\
    \ YOU! So thank you for your passion, commitment, and inspiration in paving the\
    \ way to victory in 2024! \n\nNow, let's get to work - together!"
