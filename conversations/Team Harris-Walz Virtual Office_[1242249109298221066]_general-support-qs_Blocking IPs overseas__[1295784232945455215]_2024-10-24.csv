I can't visit events.democrats.org or mobilize. I was able to yesterday. (I just clicked on something in a ""because you went to Camp Kamala."" link.) I understand needing to block IPs at the cloudflare level, had to do it to block SMS farming. And if you're under a DDOS you need to do that. But, pretty sure my IP should only be associated with click me clicks?"

It did seem to answer the question of whether it was a matter of blocking overseas traffic. Maybe?"
