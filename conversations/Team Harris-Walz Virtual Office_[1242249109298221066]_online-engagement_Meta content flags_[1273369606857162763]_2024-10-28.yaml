  content: my IG account was unlocked for about 1/2 a day and now my comments are
    locked again.Is anyone else having issues with Instagram? Posting to my own account
    is rather pointless as it's just preaching to the choir...If I cannot comment
    to amplify the posts of others, I don't even know what good I'm doing other than
    keeping my own followers engaged in election info. Feels very much like being
    CENSORED...

  content: I suggest asking in <#1250550849998946417>, because this thread is about
    content in posts being flagged.  (If you're copy-and-pasting comments, then IG
    may think you're a spam bot.)

  content: 'I''m getting spied on by facebook live even.  If they don''t like what
    *I haven''t even posted yet, * Facebook won''t allow me to post what I was trying
    to say or anything else at all for that matter.  I was totally silenced by Facebook
    today from the #1A crowd even.  I Decided to walk away and post elsewhere where
    nobody is sitting in a cubicle somewhere getting paid to watch my every move.  Its
    very disconcerting and I totally lost my mojo today when that happened and if
    I can''t sleep it off tonight I will be too depressed to even want to share a
    post when my depression could rub off on someone.  those are the days I don''t
    post but I''m hoping to sleep it off'

  content: At this point it's not worth posting to Instagram, literally EVERYTHING
    I've tried to post has been flagged as spam, trying to fake likes/interest or
    whatever. Even photos I took or graphics I created, all with captions I wrote.
    Even our Orgs endorsements are being flagged. It's ridiculous. No Reach content
    has been approved in 2 weeks.

  content: Hi there- Maybe try reposting things from online news channels like Meidas
    Touch or NowThisImpact or the campaign and democracts? at least you can amplify
    their posts and get them higher in the algorithm. Liking and commenting is also
    helpful. I feel your frustration...x

  content: If IG is flagging ALL Reach content, then it's not working for everyone
    on the OE Team.  But the campaign is still posting Kamala content to its [IG account](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-9DPQqizUB/).
