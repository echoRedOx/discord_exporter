Content: üëã Hi! I have a quick question about rally signs. When I hosted a watch party for the last debate with President Biden I was able to sign up to get free rally signs and stickers sent to me for the event. I've already signed up to host a watch party for the national convention next week. Will we be able to get rally signs and stickers sent to us for that as well?

Content: I'll be streaming the entire DNC, All Debates (will get added as they get added) and Election day from right after I vote until the election is called ‚ù§Ô∏è When you register i send out a little note with instructions and an introduction to who i am and such. That way you can decide before the event if you want to watch with me.

Content: I know that's an event-specific project, so it doesn't need many volunteers.  Sorry, I don't have more info beyond that and I don't know if it's even begun.  If you're looking for longer-term special projects, consider https://events.democrats.org/event/621790/

Content: Hi Cheryl, I can see your event here on my end, if you want to private message me the folks/names you are seeing, or at least enough of the names for me to search for if you're uncomfortable sharing the full name, I can get them out of there for you ASAP!

Content: <@1250880260338094331> Thanks for sending over the toolkit! I have a question: Is it possible to do an online fundraiser as part of the watch party? I was hoping the toolkit explained this part but it's not included. Let me know and thanks!

Content: Hi Elianne, unfortunately due to campaign finance laws we cannot sanction a fundraiser component of your watch parties, but you can direct folks to kamalaharris.com to donate if you wish! Thanks for checking <:kamala2:1269136763734069319>

Content: I couldn't figure out how to change our mobilize event from private to public, so we started a signup on Facebook AND created a new mobilize link not thru the campaign. Altogether we are expecting ~ 30 people tonight! Still no sign of a swag box/envelope/anything even tho we submitted the form as soon as it was available. Excitement is in the air!!

Content: You need to login (in the upper-right corner).  Other hosts have created their watch parties with that form.  If you don't see a form, then try another browser.

Content: Hi Joe! I‚Äôm so glad to see you are persisting in the face of difficulties to get this watch party planned! The link that Rootsmusic sent is the same one I was sending, but I think perhaps the confusion might be because the form is already filled out with a basic template.  You are able to delete and edit the already filled out portions of the form. So, when you scroll down on that page just a little bit, under Basic Information you can see ‚ÄúEvent Title‚Äù and then a text box where the title ‚ÄúDebate Watch Party‚Äù is displayed. That text box, and all the other text boxes, are able to be edited. Let me know if that helps!

Content: I know we are supposed to be getting bingo cards for the debate watch party. Has anyone else made anything cool they're willing to share? 
I was hoping to get more tangible activities at the training today so I'm still looking for some cool things to do with my guests.

Content: In the past, other hosts do postcarding, training or discussion of issues.  (Indivisible's main page has a toolkit that links to several bingo cards.)  If you're interested in these activities, I can suggest resources.

Content: Thanks <@791857656897732648> I already have a bunch of post cards I am going to have for ppl. I was thinking of more fun activities for before and during any breaks. Maybe I'll make some sort of issues trivia... but I can't wrap my brain around how to make it anything other than, "which candidate has logical opinions on [X] issue and which is less coherent than a bag of cats?"

Content: (Have you received the toolkit?  I thought it has some good suggestions, because commercial breaks aren't very long.)  A pretty short idea is to complete a vote plan, which will train guests to help others do so.  The goal of group activity is to take collective action, because most people aren't very motivated when volunteering alone.

Content: Also, I accidentally made my virtual watch party public and a random joined. I decided to google him and it appears he may be a republican. I already changed the event back to private, but is there anyway I can remove this random person from my event?? ahhhhh

Your situation has more depth. 
 I keep thinking what really matters?
I support you Not wasting time. 
So, what is the source of your inspiration? 
What steps can you take?
I think of my kids and the country I fought for and feel like I can tackle another obstacle. 
Even talking to you helps me feel the efforts are worthwhile. 
I appreciate whatever steps you can take because I know you make a difference!!!

Content: Our online debate watch party last night was amazing. The lowest number we had was 500+ people in there and we for up to 2.5k. We made up our own Bingo game and we had 50 people join our Discord just to play with us. We are using the swag that we got from our DNC watch party as prizes for the Bingo winners. They had so much fun that they are already asking for a VP debate watch party with Bingo ü§£ü§£ The chatter in the chat was unreal and we had people fact checking live and dropping sources into the chat. Today they are saying how much they want merch that says ‚Äú81 million people fired you‚Äù ü§£ü§£üíôüíôüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

Content: <@1250880260338094331> my VP debate watch party just went live and the first person who signed up has a user name of S**tbag. I set their status to Cancelled. Can you remove them? It would be nice if we could remove offenders ourselves.  UPDATE: had another with an offensive name, even worse than the one above. I just mark them as 'Cancelled'. Sarah Jane did remove the first one....

Content: I'd love to host a virtual watch party for the VP debate and I'm wondering about best practices - how do the virtual watch parties work? Do I just schedule a Zoom link or something and have people watch the actual debate on whatever platform/device they want and then also participate in the watch party Zoom call? I remember seeing a training session for the presidential debate. Is there a training session for hosting a VP debate watch party too? (I might just be missing it somewhere.) Thanks in advance!

Content: I set up my virtual watch parties with an additional registration to the Zoom. There are explicit instructions and a link in the Mobilize listing AND I send out emails to those who have registered through Mobilize that they need to take that additional step and register through Zoom too. The 2 previous watch parties filled up and a lot of folks complied with the requirement to register through Zoom. For the VP Watch Party, the event has filled up but only 1 person has complied with repeated requests to register through Zoom. I feel like I need to Cancel folks who have not complied so others who want to sign up can do so. What do you think?

Content: Hi <@350058078277992450> ... if you have had success with 2-part registration in the past and want to continue that for security reasons, I totally understand. I'd just mention that the more barriers to entry, the more likely you will have more participants who won't fully comply with dual registrations... people (especially volunteers) are VERY busy right now and only going to get busier as we get closer to Election Day!

Content: Thanks so much for the feedback. I totally realize that about barriers and take that into consideration. I am fairly certain I got flooded with signups by rightwingers/bots in the previous WPs but didn't see that happen this time. I might still change the link to no registration....

Content: <@1257077807574552588> - As of 12pm ET: Looks like we don't have anything official shared yet here or on Reach, scanning through socials it seems any hashtags are only just gathering steam... (trending seems to be things like President Jimmy Carter's 100th bday, start of spooky season, etc.)

From looking at Twitter/Insta/TikTok/Threads/Bluesky:
It looks like [# vpdebate / vpdebate2024] + related tags like [vp / politics / etc.] are being used.

I will be sending out an email shortly with the best place to stream it online and also the bingo cards, though I am very glad to see they have already been circulated here already! Please let me know if you need me to make any last minute changes to your events, and if you've already asked me know that it will be done in the next little bit! My final ask for tonight: PLEASE SEND ME ALL PICTURES!!! Send them to me as they come in at smerritt@2024victory.com

Content: <@&1266883962727432304>   Hi so we registered for a VP Debate watch party the day I got the email. On 9/24 I got an email that said this..
‚ÄúThank you so much for requesting to host a Debate Watch party! It looks like you actually signed up via the national link, but as a Pennsylvanian, it would actually be so very appreciated if you could sign up for our state specific link.
Not to worry: we are coordinating with our national partners at the DNC and there won't be an expectation for you to host 2 parties or duplicate your efforts. 
Please sign up here at your earliest convenience, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions! 
Apologies for any inconvenience. ‚Äú
 
I replied telling them that even though I live in GA, my co host lives in VT and we are hosting it on TikTok like we did the 4 nights of the DNC & the Pres Debate. I didn‚Äôt hear anything until last week when they asked us to fill out the form for hosting (to get the campaign swag) I filled out 2 (1 for each of us) and the next day went to make a post with the link to register and it‚Äôs GONE! It‚Äôs now the day of the debate and I have no link and still can‚Äôt find it. Should we just run it on our own?
Thanks

Content: I found a time table that says the speech begins at 7:15pm EST. According to a local news channel, "The 'First Amendment Political Speech' event will start Tuesday at 7:15 p.m. but will be open to the public at 3:00 p.m."
