Content: Hi, I just got on and started making calls to Michigan. Is the purpose to get out the vote or to educate? The opening of the script is very long, and I'm wondering if it's ok if I jump right to "Do you have a plan to vote?"

Content: <@1057037857774121020> Most phone banks have a theme, like "voting plan" or "confirming volunteers" if you don't see anything obvious in the script, you can ask in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1263529508300914809 and someone will know.
