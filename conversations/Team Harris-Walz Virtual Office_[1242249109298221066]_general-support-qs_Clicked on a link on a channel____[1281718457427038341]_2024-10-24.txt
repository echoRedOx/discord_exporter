Content: I don't know why I did, I thought maybe it was something we were supposed to do? it took me. to the scale to win and said no callees were there or something like that. I just closed the whole browser b/c I couldn;'t log out or anything??  It was a little notification # 1 by the # click-me suggested channel on the left side of the page. Right here on Discord. it was a notification and a message on that channel with a link i clicked on

Content: Hi Robyn!  The <#1279085616247869451> channel is used to approve numbers to be added to the call list!  Every now and then, a staff member will post a link that needs a lot of people to just click the buttons to do the approvals, and then they will say "check again" when they are finished.  That's it!  Do not worry about any kind of logging in or out for this.

When the next link is posted, the staff will ping again, and anyone who sees it online at the time will be in there clicking until it's done.  They can get done fast!
