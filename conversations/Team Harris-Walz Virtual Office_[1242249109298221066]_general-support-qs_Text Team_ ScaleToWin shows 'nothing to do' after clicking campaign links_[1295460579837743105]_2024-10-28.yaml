  content: When I click on a texting campain link in the <#1265788349747171438> channel,
    I just see the 'nothing to do' page - not even grayed campain buttons. I am returning
    to texting after taking a break for about two weeks. When I go to the top-level
    url at that site, I see the message about not being registered. What do I need
    to do to get back into texting? Can a text-team mod verify that my ScaleToWin
    account is still connected with this? I was directed to post here by a text-team
    mod.
