  content: HI <@1277413673438023752> thank you so much for completing texting training!
    We really appreciate your volunteer efforts. It takes the team a little while
    to onboard everyone from the training sessions, and you will get a DM when they
    are ready for you. If you are still waiting on Monday you can send a reminder
    here https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1266829704204386334

  content: <@1277413673438023752> the New Mod Recruitment channel is closed right
    now because staff is training volunteers who applied earlier. When we need more
    mods, the channel will re-open
