  content: Some scripts have an already voted option, if not select who they intend
    to vote for and how - if you are able to get that detail.  You can select end
    survey after entering the relevant info.  When they vote they'll be removed from
    our list.

  content: Most scripts don't have the already voted. In the zPBs, we ask who they
    support, thank them, and end call. As said above, if they actually did vote, they
    will be removed from the lists.

  content: its a state by state decision which survey questions appear.  Refused is
    appropriate if they won't tell you who!
