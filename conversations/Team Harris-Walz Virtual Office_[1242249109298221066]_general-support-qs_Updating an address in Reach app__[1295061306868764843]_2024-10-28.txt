Content: I have a voter in Reach who recently moved and is in a totally different area now. They thought they updated their voter registration, but aren‚Äôt sure. Reach app still has old address & voting info. Can I update it somehow to get their current voting precincts etc? They‚Äôre a strong Harris supporter, but an infrequent voter. Trying to encourage them to get out and vote. Thanks!

Content: Hi <@465305140786888705>: I am researching that now for you. I found out you can edit nicknames or preferred names now too, if that comes up.

Content: FYI - I am looking here, which you may have done already. https://democrats.org/reach/vr/ but the actual steps are in the Reach Online Knowledge Base. https://www.reach.vote/knowledge-base/contact-actions/.  Yes, it says you can edit.

Content: Thank you for helping me figure out how to update their address! I've been gently poking them to go vote this year. They're a good friend, so I can use compassionate peer pressure on them lol. Thanks for all you're doing to help the campaign as well!

Content: Well, sorry for the bad news, but it looks like you cannot edit the address on DNC Reach (desktop or mobile version). The voter would have to update the address via their voter registration card.  Reach needs to update their knowledge base website.  Sorry. üôÇ

Content: Thanks for looking into this for me. Bummer. I'll have to hunt down their voting precinct information by hand then. I'm pretty sure that if I tell them where to go and when it's open, they'll go out and vote when they otherwise wouldn't. Thank you so much for taking time to hunt down info for me!
