Content: Hi all - while we're waiting on texting campaigns to wrap up more I would love to stay involved and keep helping out. I am interested in working with the Mobile Inbox team for Digital Correspondence, but it looks like I may have missed the last training.

Are there any recordings of these trainings, or an intent to do more in the future? I would really like to join that team as well and would feel bad if I missed out on the last chance, especially with the DNC coming up and a likely spike in engagement.

Thank you!

Content: They'll probably have some stuff after the convention. Don't quote me on that because I don't really know for certain but I do know from doing this for 8 years that it's always after conventions that they really start amping up the number of volunteers on numerous levels. So keep an eye out for that we do put links to all the different trainings in the events section on the sidebar in the server so always look there to see what kind of trainings we have going on

Content: We don't have recording, but I am sure we will have many more opportunities. While you are waiting for Mobile Inbox and texting, you could try the Sharebank at 4pm today. https://discord.gg/UYgRBx7T?event=1273363421236170832

Content: Is there a good place to go that can offer suggestions for what to say to friends and family members when they report misinformation as if it were absolute fact and accuse me of being the one who is no fact checking? For example my oldest sister constantly says “Kamala is such a liar!” I’ve tried to ask her what lies she’s supposedly told (sister pivots). When I suggest fact checking sites, I don’t think she checks them because she believes conspiracies - like Hilary’s Pizza thing. Ridiculous. I’m wondering if anyone has found a way to say something to close-minded Fox & Friends that will get them to open their minds?

Content: Here is a training for countering misinformation online, which might give you some strategy for countering your sister in person.
