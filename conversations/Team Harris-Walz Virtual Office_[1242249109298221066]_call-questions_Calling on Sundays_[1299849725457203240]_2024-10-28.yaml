  content: I may be revealing my age a little bit with this comment, but I'm hesitant
    to call people on Sunday. What has the experience been for others? Thanks ahead
    of time.

  content: Hi Terri, thank you for being here! Everyone may have different opinions
    about receiving calls on Sunday. If they don't wish to receive calls, they have
    the option to not answer. In my experience, there will be people annoyed that
    we are calling no matter what day it is. We have such limited time left until
    the election that every day is important for us to reach voters.
