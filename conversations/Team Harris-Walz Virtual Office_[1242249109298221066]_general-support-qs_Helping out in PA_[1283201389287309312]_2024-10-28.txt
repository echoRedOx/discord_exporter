Content: Hi <@1277630108127199437> I encourage you to get the PA role, then you can ask the folks in that channel. You can get your new fole by going to Channels & Roles near the top of your left menu. Also you can search on https://events.democrats.org, put the city, zip or state in the location to see events close by.
