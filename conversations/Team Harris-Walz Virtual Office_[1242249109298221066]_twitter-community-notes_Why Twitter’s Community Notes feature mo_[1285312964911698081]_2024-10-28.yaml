  content: "I appreciate the responses, Dan.  The consensus of the articles you sent\
    \ is basically that CNs can work for scientific topics and stuff everyone agrees\
    \ is misinformation, but it fails at fighting political disinformation.  Unfortunately\
    \ that's what we're trying to fight here.  I'm wondering if it would be a better\
    \ use of resources to direct volunteers into making phone calls or something else\
    \ instead.  We've gotta win this election, and it seems that we could put a lot\
    \ of effort into CNs and get nothing back.\n\nThat first article had a really\
    \ interesting quote too: \"Twitter waits until a similar number of people on the\
    \ political right and left have agreed to attach a public Community Note to a\
    \ tweet.\"  So ironically having even more people on the left voting for a CN\
    \ might hurt its chances...  \U0001F626"

    \ into the conversation could work.  Retweeting, commenting, liking, etc.  I'm\

  content: I really liked the idea of CNs because it seems like you get to establish
    a ground truth when someone is spreading misinformation.  Unfortunately it didn't
    really work out that way in practice.
