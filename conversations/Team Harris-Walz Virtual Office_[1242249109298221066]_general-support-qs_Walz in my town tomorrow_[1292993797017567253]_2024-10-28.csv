How do I find out the best location to be along the road or outside meeting location?  We have Harris/Walz signs.  I do not believe he is doing a public event though.

If there is no public event, it is difficult to know where he will be. You might post in the <#1268356016240857088> channel to see if any other volunteers are organizing around the visit."
