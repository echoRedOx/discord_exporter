They just show up in news stories mostly. 

So on this server, since we're really just focused on online volunteer campaign work and don't get this far into the weeds most of the time, we like to have these conversations in <#1268690577960992878> where those interested can discuss (but not debate) and develop an informed response should it come up. Though, it's unlikely to come up often in volunteer work here since it's highly specific."
