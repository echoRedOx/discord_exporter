  content: "Hi <@266755327859359744> I also had this issue because I\u2019m on multiple\
    \ servers of different sizes. Unfortunately, for those servers where I wanted\
    \ to stay anonymous, I opted to leave until after the election. If you do find\
    \ a way to maintain different aliases by server\u2014I would definitely like to\
    \ know how to do that!"

  content: I was able to change my username locally by right-clicking on my username
    on a post, but not by going through the gear icon over there on the bottom left.
    It appears to be the old one still on other servers. But I'm stuck with the picture
    unless I change it everywhere. I tried to create a different account, but since
    it's linked to your phone number, Discord won't let me. So the picture remains.  Not
    a fan of using Discord for this, because like you I want to preserve anonymity
    on other public-accessible forums here.
