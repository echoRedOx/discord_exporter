I’m a MOD over there. We are still waiting for approval of our Sept campaigns. However once that happens, we will most likely be texting again from 9am til 9pm everyday. We will be helping various campaigns throughout the country that don’t have the resources to build their own teams. We will also be focusing on educating voters in the various states on their voting requirements."
