Content: Me too Dyluck!  I have no problem talking by typing online but I'm pathologically shy to the point that I'm all but terrified to call a stranger. At all.  But on texting and typing my thoughts, I have no problem.  I'm also very phobic around crowds.

Content: I experience anxiety. But after the first call it melts away. I try to put myself in the same mental space as when Iâ€™m teaching online via Zoom and meeting a new class for the first time, or going to teach a workshop for people I never met. Iâ€™m excited to sign up for another shift and only hope the technology cooperates this time ðŸ¤ž
