I know most of these folks personally after being on these platforms since their inception.  My tactic is to personally message people and respond to every positive response I get to confirm their VOTE and use their networks through REACH or other.  So far, I'm meeting with excellent success.  About 1 in 5 contacts results in a ""conversation"" (back and forth messaging in which I can identify the voter and determine further volunteer work).  I have made approximately 1500 personal contacts thus far resulting in over 300 ""conversations.""  About 1/3 of these said they download or consider downloading REACH."

When I post anything, I'm adding an invitation to engage the campaign through REACH (on FB, Linkedin, or x or my various email groups - of which I have over 30.  If I get a like or a comment or a share, I respond to that person and try to create a conversation via message (it works more often when you're obviously dealing with a responder who shares your values).  I've created new connections in this manner and have access to a larger and larger group of confirmed supporters."

Open House from 5-9p with whiskies from around the world.  I'll use my email and phone contacts to nail down 15 hosts at $100-250 and then we'll recruit from there.  Goal is $5K but I'm hoping for closer to $10K.  I will use my email invitations (over 400) to encourage people to download and use REACH for their relational organizing in the digital sphere.
