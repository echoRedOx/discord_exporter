Content: Hi Hawk! The mod team will be creating a channel with precise campaign messaging on the platform planks once they are released by the official campaign. We're trying to make sure the messaging is exact and accurate to the actual campaign. We should see them release that very soon and we'll add a channel here when we have that topical guidance.
