  content: I got blocked by cloudflare when I clicked on a link. I can't visit events.democrats.org
    or mobilize. I was able to yesterday. (I just clicked on something in a "because
    you went to Camp Kamala." link.) I understand needing to block IPs at the cloudflare
    level, had to do it to block SMS farming. And if you're under a DDOS you need
    to do that. But, pretty sure my IP should only be associated with click me clicks?

  content: Thanks KT, we're seeing reports about this from a few users. I do not believe
    it is intentional but we are waiting to hear more info and possible workarounds.
    Sorry for the inconvenience!

  content: KT, I don't know if this is helpful but I was able to get around this in
    England by setting up a VPN so that my computer acted like it was in the United
    States. It did seem to answer the question of whether it was a matter of blocking
    overseas traffic. Maybe?

  content: I mean sure it's helpful to me, but if we're working around things and
    there's an actual site problem, the actual site people should know about it. usually
    when Cloudflare is helpy on its own there is a root cause. I thought I'd wait
    to see if it clears up on its own so I don't forget when I go binge on netflix.
