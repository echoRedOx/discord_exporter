""All the Best People"" is a stark reminder from unprecedented numbers of people who served in ""Trump I"" who left sounding the alarm, like Press Secretary Stepanie Grisham. Her story is especially compelling because she joined the Administration as a ""true believer"" but left denouncing Trump as ""the ultimate con man"" and warning that a second term would be ""nothing but revenge, retribution and how he can benefit himself.""

1. Use reputable sources whether they be from our guidance and staffers or from a source with clout. Good examples of news outlets if anyone's looking to share that are sources like Reuters and the Associated Press since they are wire services and therefore they don't have any of the bias we're seeing from many of the big ones like CNN. 
2. Don't use any inflammatory language. This is not just because we're taking the Michelle Obama, ""They go low, we go high"" approach right now but also because of something called slander. If you don't know anything about that, I do encourage you to look it up. We're trying to avoid anything that will make us look like a bunch of jagoffs basically.
3. I know this is a crazy time but there's a reason why we're taking the approach we are right now and since I'm a bit of a social science nerd on top of having knowledge of Communication and media, I think what we're trying to do it take an approach of speak softly and carry a big stick. Now I know Teddy Roosevelt was saying, ""Oh, I'll use the military if I have to"" basically but in the digital world it's more like, ""We're going to post that uplifting content and show we mean it when we say that we want to unite the nation but we'll also remind you that our opponents are horrible people.""

In other words: use reputable sources, present the facts like we always did, and for the love of God...KEEP YOUR LANGUAGE CIVIL! You guys are doing great so far so let's just keep breaking through the noise and show that we're nothing like these people that are causing all the fighting, division, and hate. Thanks everyone!"

Here's my script. If you don't want to talk with a live person, try calling at night or on the weekend:    I‚Äôm not a constituent, but what you do impacts my life. News reports say that you are asking President Biden to drop out of the race. If that‚Äôs true, I think you should consider that he is probably the best president we‚Äôve had in a generation, in terms of getting things done in spite of a lot of opposition from MAGA Republicans. I think you should also consider that a lot of us voters voted for him in the primary, thinking we actually HAD a vote in a real primary.

I thought age discrimination was illegal in this country. Apparently not for Presidents or candidates.

Here are key messages we wanted to share: 

- Vice President Harris has spent the past four years as a governing partner to the most experienced president in American history. She has helped pass and implement historic legislation, and strengthened America‚Äôs national security through her travels to more than 20 countries and meetings with over 150 world leaders.

- Her record as Vice President builds on a distinguished career as District Attorney, Attorney General, and United States Senator from the nation‚Äôs largest state.

- No one is better prepared than Vice President Harris to prosecute the case against Donald Trump. Her work as a prosecutor makes her the ultimate contrast to Trump, the convicted felon.

- Vice President Harris was part of the only ticket to ever beat Trump, earning 81 million votes in 2020 as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate.

We'll have more tomorrow! In the mean time, excited to be here with all of you and doing this important work."

In all, Trump‚Äôs wall costs about five times more per mile than fencing built under the Bush and Obama administrations.

Experts say the frequent use of so-called supplemental agreements to add work or increase the price has amounted to giving no-bid contracts to a small group of pre-selected construction firms, many with executives who have donated to Trump or other Republicans.‚Äù And the funds used were from drug enforcement despite the fact that drug trafficking is almost always dine through legal ports of entry."

I posted on Facebook in response to Vance‚Äôs comments earlier this week about childless people not caring about our future. I was especially offended that he included adoptive parent Pete Buttigieg in his list of childless cat ladies and responded from a personal place as an adoptive parent myself. I pointed out that Adoptive parents deliberately choose to take up the responsibility of care for a future generation. But I expanded my comment to a broader point - Americans are generous, and loving, and perpetually optimistic and future oriented. Don‚Äôt try to shrink our national concern down to a craven and egomanical world view. 

I got a lot of positive and vocal engagement from people who were mostly already dems already and happy to comment that they would be out and voting this year, but also from someone I was surprised by. They seemed very connected and enthusiastic about tying democratic platform to real values of caring and optimism."

I don't think you need to give birth to a child to care for the next generation. If that were true men wouldn't care about the future at all. There are many ways to make a family. The only important ingredient is love. Step parents are parents. Adoptive parents are parents. Foster parents are parents. Found parents are parents. Raising another couple's children is an act of compassion, love and optimism."

1. This is not an easy thing to do. I mean, you can't wave a magic wand and boom, it's gone. There's supply & demand, shrinkflation, etc. Also, I think <@1266177007755198517>raises a great point about how the problem really is global. For instance, I have a friend who moved to Canada because of her job and one day she was doing the conversions and realized that she's paying a lot more in Canada than the US. 
2. Trump did a lot of things that caused a lot of this as we know. Biden inherited a lot of economic mess and it wasn't all because of the pandemic. 

Also, I was asking around and <@1260983976483356767> pointed out to me there's some things in the library on Reach regarding the Inflation Reduction Act which I really suggest everyone taking a look at and sharing with anyone who talks about this because I have heard this complaint from everyone...including my dad who is VERY anti-Trump. The reason why my dad stopped complaining was because one day we were in Walmart and saw several products we buy all the time with lower prices than the last time. Also, I buy a lot in bulk and have been for years but the last time I was in BJ's (it's kinda like Costco which I also frequent), I saw prices on a lot of things being much less than they were a couple weeks ago. We're seeing the impacts of the IRA but it's just taking longer than most people would like."

If the person is viewing on a desktop and takes out their phone and scans the code they've moved from the desktop to their phone. I think its more effective just to put a link to where you want them to go instead of a QR code. I typically only use QRs in print media and physicial signage. Hope that helps!

If you use hashtags to get seen by young ppl in spaces that aren't political they get annoyed. You can create a call to action hashtag like get active or go vote with a year attached. Grassroots hashtags will be most successful for Gen z that don't feel apart of much. Ex: local trash clean up hashtags or subreddits for cleaning and use your host training to organize (something I'm working on today)

Especially during disasters.  What scares me is the thought of a company getting bought up or going out of business when our leaders need to reach us.  So I want her to suggest requring all government agencies and representatives to exclusively use open source platforms like mastodon that don't rely on a company.  The US can afford to run it's own mastodon servers (and does already in a lot of education settings).  That way we never have to worry about any of those nightmare scenarios.

I‚Äôm one of the creators in the volunteer content brigade and I have another question for all the Online Engagement folks. We have occasionally gotten some feedback as to what subjects you‚Äôd like us to cover (Project 2025, Kamala‚Äôs accomplishments etc.)  But what we haven‚Äôt heard is how you‚Äôre feeling about the content we are making.

** Is there any feedback you can share about what things ‚Äì or even types of things ‚Äì your people are responding/engaging to? **

For instance:
‚Äì are comparison graphics between the candidates helpful? 
‚Äì or infographics?
‚Äì snarky jabs at Trump/Vance/GOP?
‚Äì graphics featuring quotes (either negative or positive)?
‚Äì memes?
‚Äì positive photos, slogans of Kamala
- negative videos of Trump/Vance/GOP
‚Äì positive videos of Kamala

- Has anything really clicked with your circle that surprised you? Or has nothing? And how are the volunteer-made things comparing to other things you find online and share? Is there anything others are doing that you would like our team to lean into more? 

And lastly, a question for the leads. <@1256039311367999658> <@941196169852366859> <@1054909991468929104> <@1184187512491618404> <@1263196733790224597> <@1247909990560301182> <@1248274609086660722> 
 I know views and shares are a very inexact science, but Reach and Sosha and Discord all have analytics and ways of getting feedback from volunteers. Do we have any data on what we think might be working well and working less well at this point? 

Thanks very much in advance for your honest and constructive feedback. We have lots of wonderful volunteers creating lots of different things ‚Äî which we will all continue to do. But personally, I think it would be great to hear how it all might be playing ‚Äî or *not * playing ‚Äî out in the wild and how we can better help you engage!"

I was living in Gandia when refugees were stranded in a ship. Our city took in an amount that community groups could support. They were welcomed at the Town Hall and given Spanish lessons. Those that were able were given jobs in the city or community to offset their cost of housing and utilities. They were put on the social healthcare system and given vouchers for food and personal items. This helped the local economy as well. The Mayor and city council decided how many immigrants were allowed in the city. I had to register at the City Hall and the police department to stay past my 3 months and apply to the province capital for residency.

Don't fall for the PR stunt.  Project 2025 is the playbook for a Trump presidency organized by The Heritage Foundation.

In 2022, speaking at their annual leadership conference, Trump actually said, ‚ÄúThis is a great group, and they‚Äôre going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do‚Ä¶And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

Why else would he tell Christian extremists you won't have to vote anymore after 2025 if you elect him? 

Whose staffers are all part of project 2025? Trump's.  

Whose appointees are part of it? Trump's.  

Whose supreme Court appointees are part of it? 
Trump's.

Who works in the background as donors and funders of Trump? The federalist society and Project 2025."

I wasn't sure where else to put this, but this could be big, and maybe something that we should keep in our back pockets as the Trump campaign tries to distance itself from Project 2025. 

JD Vance is literally the face of conventionofstates.com right now. If you don't know what it is, it is Project 2025 without going the whole ""executive branch takeover"" route. Article V of the Constitution includes two routes for amending itself. This is the option that we have never used. They want the same thing as Project 2025. They even said so here in an archived blog post: https://web.archive.org/web/20240802175038/https://conventionofstates.com/news/what-is-project-2025-a-plot-to-destroy-america-or-a-playbook-to-dismantle-the-ruling-class

I archived that link in case they scrub the blog post from their site.

I think it is important to get some eyes on this. Bringing light to Project 2025 has severely damaged the Trump campaign. If Convention of States gets the same attention, AND Mr. Vance is proudly the face of it, perhaps this could energize more democracy enthusiasts like myself : )

After all, the distance between Trump and Vance will be a heartbeat if they somehow win. Again, sorry if this isn't the right place. I wasn't sure where else to get the word out.

In short, I want to pull factual info/quotes from the documents to compare and contrast. Then attach screen shots of the relevant language from the documents.

Does anything like this already exists? A lot of what I'm seeing in the Reach App are general, very broad, statements.

Also the threat of political upheaval makes CEOs very anxious, and when they are anxious, they curtail growth, and cut costs.

The best way to do this is to simply see what issues matter to them. Engage in a conversation with them and then you provide the facts.

For instance: let's say your friend talks about infrastructure. They say about how they're afraid of a bridge collapse or if they take mass transit, issues with mass transit.

What you can do at first is connect with them and be like, ""Hey, I get it. I was on the train heading home and I felt like this thing was going to fall apart (or there were delays not to be believed)."" or you can say how you are concerned because of recent bridge collapses that caused traffic jams (we had this happen with a part of I-95 in the Philadelphia area).

Next is to tell them how the Democrats have combat this. You can talk about how the Biden administration has pumped billions into improving our bridges and mass transit. For instance, here in PA where I live, that part of I-95 that collapsed was repaired very quickly and the mass transit system, SEPTA was able to accommodate the overflow to the point where they worked with other nearby systems to borrow extra trains to ease congestion on the rails. There was also an announcement in the Philadelphia area that SEPTA is planning to improve the cars on their subway lines and also, Amtrak itself has had massive improvements to their stations, trains, and lines.

Basically you're connecting with the voter and providing information and trust me, it does work. For instance in 2022, I canvassed in the town I live in and this one lady said about gas prices which were close to $4 a gallon at the time in some places. I could relate because I have a (small) SUV and I told her how John Fetterman wasn't going to pander to big oil. It won her on voting Dem. 

Hope this helps."

He's done so much for Michigan. All children have free breakfast and lunch. They do lunches during the summer. He's done a lot for education (he's a former teacher). He's done paid family and medical leave. If you get a driver's license you are automatically enrolled to vote. He's a great pick.

They're great. I went to parts 1 and 2. The best tip is that when people react negatively to a post, even when it's just something like sharing where Kamala and Tim stand on issues, it's better to just not engage. Move on and do the most good you can with others. My instinct sometimes is to engage to understand where the person is coming from. With only 90 days to go, we have to be focused on undecideds, not those who would never vote for this ticket. That really helped me, especially yesterday, when I posted about Tim adopting rescue pets. Most people were lovely and it got so much engagement. And there were a few who were just hateful. I just muted the hateful ones and it was absolutely the right thing to do. ü´∂"

What a difference a few weeks make!
 
Harris-Walz is surging, Trump-Vance is flailing. But the election still looks to be razor close, especially in swing states.
 
To that end, I‚Äôm pleased to report that the video series is gaining attention across the ‚ÄúBlue Wall,‚Äù with Democratic officials from Susquehanna County, PA, to Oakland County, MI, to Polk County, WI, sharing the videos with voters. It‚Äôs also heartening to see leading news organizations reporting on the large number of former Trump Administration officials who are not endorsing Trump in 2024.  In that vein, Talking Points Memo just published a piece titled ‚ÄúThe Democrats Secret Weapon,‚Äù identifying leading figures from the Trump Administration who are opposing him now. And I‚Äôd expect that the Democratic Convention, which starts August 19, will feature former Trump officials who are now supporting Harris-Walz.
 
Indeed, an extraordinary percentage of Trump‚Äôs former cabinet appointees ‚Äì almost 50% ‚Äì are not supporting him in 2024. For good reason. Watch (https://ourfutureourchoice.net/compilation/) as high-level appointees explain why they left the Trump Administration sounding the alarm. And please share this link with neighbors, friends, colleagues, and relatives.

A couple suggestions:
1. Please make sure these message of the day items get added as ""Action Cards"" in Reach. It makes it so easy to share.
2. The link you shared goes to another video when the ad ends. I recall that it is possible in YouTube to create links that simply cycle back to allow viewers to replay the ad. You may want to use those features.

Hope this is helpful."

Yes, give sympathy and space to those who say ""no ceasefire, no vote.""   I thought Kamala's response to hecklers in Detroit was too abrupt. She did meet with reps from the Arab American community before the rally, and as a result, an Arab American official is now supporting Kamala.    In AZ yesterday, she had a longer response to hecklers saying the administration is working around the clock to get a ceasefire & bring the hostages home. I am working on talking points on this topic, using AOC's wonderful response and Kamala's official statements. Many credit Kamala for having more empathy for the Palestinian's plight & stronger on the need for a ceasefire than Biden.  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/07/25/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-following-meeting-with-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-of-israel/  https://www.thewrap.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-biden-gaza-war/"

Little thing I wrote up about Tim's Nickname by Republicans/GOP

Walz being called ""Tampon Tim"" by Republicans/GOP is actually doing our work for us; as we can see on this article by The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/10/republicans-tampon-tim-walz) Tim Walz actually made mandates for Schools to have Free Mensturation Products, The Guardians Arwa Mahdawi states ""...mandated public schools offer free menstruation products in their bathrooms."" Additionally, Mahdawi states that ""Tampons are expensive! And ‚Äúperiod poverty‚Äù ‚Äì the inability to afford menstruation supplies ‚Äì is a serious problem in the US."" This New York Post Article shows how expensive Tampons & Pads are getting (https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/business/tampon-pad-prices-nearly-double-over-last-5-years-due-to-inflation/)  As they have doubled the prices over the past 5 years. 

The Menstrual Products being funded by the State Government is **true** in https://www.house.mn.gov/sessiondaily/Story/17937 one of the many things the bill does is quote ""$3.6 million for menstrual products..."" showing the bill provides schools funding for Menstrual Products.

Apologies for this being legnthy, but in conclusion Republicans are actually doing some good press for the Harris-Walz Campaign by naming Tim Walz ""Tampon Tim"". Despite them trying to make fun of him with the name."

The question was asked after a bit of hype about Kamala‚Äôs rise in the polls and her crowd sizes at her rally: What can we do to keep this momentum going. Surprisingly a Republican posted an answer that made total sense. He said, ‚ÄúKeep posting the excitement and show how large these crowds are at Kamala‚Äôs rallies. Post about the well known Republicans who are endorsing Kamala/Walz. And most important don‚Äôt argue with Trump supporters online, not only is it a waste of time but also because they like the attention. I would like to add that he also suggested Trump memes are not effective at all in convincing republicans but I know it keeps the excitement going and sometimes laughter is the best medicine for my current followers supporting Kamala and Walz."

I believe AI usage will be a continuing theme in the election and could be a repeated attack against Dems like we saw with the totally fabricated story about the so called ‚ÄúAI crowds‚Äù for Harris, so best not to muddy the waters in any way.

Also, there is a sizable group that is vehemently against AI art, and campaign/supporter usage could really irk them.

Would love to hear others opinions, though- I am not necessarily against AI in general but just have concerns on usage in elections."

The naive innocent question posts are also sometimes ‚Äútime wasting trolls‚Äù or AI bots who aim to waste your time. The posts demanding that you justify your vote in detail or posts demanding a response to convince the poster to vote for Harris are designed for this purpose. Just ignore them (some are in good faith‚Ä¶check post history).
Above all, please do not engage the trolls. Just downvote, report them and move on.

My second was 2020, during Covid and quarantines - I felt like I was at the mercy of the world around me. 

A lot of friends of mine in both elections either voted 3rd party or didn‚Äôt vote, and their vocal despair got to me. It made me angry but I also agreed with them. But since then, I‚Äôve come to reevaluate my opinions and realize that I don‚Äôt have to be powerless - I can engage friends in discussion, I can push back on misinformation, I can donate to campaigns, I can make content to share with my groups. I don‚Äôt have to take the world lying down - and that‚Äôs very encouraging to me. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm motivated in this election."

In swing states, you can choose to volunteer with Kamala's campaign, Congressional campaigns or even state campaigns.  Each campaign would have their own events.

You can add those swing state's channels here, but those channels aren't very active yet.  I'd recommend joining the much larger [state groups](https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/groups) on FB and just ask the in-state volunteers for guidance.  It's also a good way to familiarize yourself with the state's issues, so their voters can't easily tell that you're not a neighbor."

What makes you motivated to help out in this election?

I was looking at this question and I started thinking of a conversation I had with Colton today in a video call. I told him how I've worked on campagins since 2016 and in that year, I worked as a field volunteer with PA Dems in lower Bucks County. There was this little girl that came in and she was asking for anything related to Hillary and I remember giving her a piece of campaign lit we had that had Hillary's photo on it and the heartbreak of seeing Hillary lose.  That's the one thing that always kept me going.

I did a lot since then from texing into several states in 2020 to spending the 2022 midterms running phone and text banks for PA Dems during the week and knocking on doors in Bristol, PA on the weekends. I still have the selfies of me with John & Gisele Fetterman from 2022 along with a photo of me with then Vice President Biden in 2016 and a photo of me and a group of field volunteers in 2016 with President Clinton. This time I keep thinking it's different because we learned from the mistakes of 2016 and we are taking an approach I only saw as a campaign volunteer once before which was in 2022 with the midterm elections in PA. I know right now we're also taking an approach which is very similar to Obama but I keep thinking of the excitement of 2022 in PA and the heartbreak of 2016 and when Kamala said, ""We're not going back,"" I was like, ""And this won't be like 2016."""

I try to use sources with mainstream credibility (which means they'll still be accused of being ""the liberal media""), and especially like to share articles authored by Never Trump Republicans/conservatives. I hit often on Trump's disrespect for military service members and his blatant immorality and, more recently, his incoherence and age. I've begun using some of the materials on Reach displaying the positive, upbeat approach of Harris-Walz and talking turn-out and its importance for younger voters."

I remember when that happened in Summer of 2019 with Pete Buttigieg- I saw him speak at a rally on TV and the next day I went to what turned out to be the grand opening of his local campaign HQ and met one of his organizers, Kat Thames.  Kat taught me and her group of volunteers how to knock on doors and make cold calls and join text campaigns and we even met Pete together!  We worked hard and became very close- we are still in touch with each other.  Pete actually won our piece of South Carolina on the day of the primary!  We did something right!  This moment with the Harris Walz campaign brings those feelings back to me- we can actually turn this tide of potential disaster into something fun and hopeful- we can grow peace,  joy and belonging in this world!!"

And i did express that I talk about better nursing home and end of life care facility regulations. More funding and science for Alzhiemers. Reducing the deffense budget to help veterans. these are things i activily use my platform for and to be told I dont care about the same things as her was just frankly insulting. She mentioned that they would like me to help get more volunteers to join, but then started talking about how no one wants to show up because its not a social club or a bar.

You PLAN, PREPARE and WORK to WIN.¬† .... How many friends can we bring to the polls?¬† ... If each of us does an extra shift, an extra hour, a little bit more, we get to wake up on that morning after the election and know that the work we did transformed the lives for millions, transformed generations, impacted the world. ....

   - Many comments insist that Project 2025 is not Trump's project and emphasize that he has publicly disavowed it.
   - **Examples:**
     - ""Trump denounced having anything to do with it.""
     - ""Trump said he didn't agree with some of the stuff in Project 2025. It's not his project.""

2. **Attribution to Heritage Foundation**
   - Comments frequently point out that Project 2025 is an initiative of the Heritage Foundation, not something authored or endorsed by Trump.
   - **Examples:**
     - ""Project 2025 is a transition plan from the Heritage Foundation, not Trump.""
     - ""Project 2025 was from a think tank.""

3. **Accusations of Spreading Misinformation**
   - Several comments accuse the original post of spreading false information or deliberately misleading readers about Trump‚Äôs connection to Project 2025.
   - **Examples:**
     - ""Why do you lie?""
     - ""Stop spreading misinformation.""

4. **Suggestions for Fact-Checking and Reliable Sources**
   - Comments advise others to seek information from more credible or authoritative sources, highlighting the importance of critical evaluation of information.
   - **Examples:**
     - ""Do we remember the difference between .com .net .org and .edu?""
     - ""Always consider that when viewing anything.""

5. **Claims of Political Fear-Mongering**
   - Some comments suggest that the post is an attempt to create unnecessary fear or panic for political purposes.
   - **Examples:**
     - ""Go fearmonger elsewhere, bot.""
     - ""Don‚Äôt fall for political fear-mongering.""

6. **Dismissal and Ridicule**
   - Some comments dismiss the concerns about Project 2025 as overreactions or mock the premise of the original post.
   - **Examples:**
     - ""Project 2025 is heritage foundation fanfic."""

I would check with various levels within your local party. You should have precinct leaders, a county party, a congressional chair, a state party, and the local campaign or another candidate. Find a down ballot candidate that wants the captive audience. You could invite someone from your local board of elections.

I like to extend the concept to pages (or subreddits) that fall into this general follower/subscriber size as well.

So for instance, you could sub to local or niche communities on reddit and be ready as a resource to discuss Harris/Walz plans that are relevant to that community, or the destructive impacts of Trump and Project 2025.

A hiking  or trail-running subreddit wouldn‚Äôt like the impacts to public spaces and parks, for instance. Neither would a local subreddit like Project 2025‚Äôs negative impacts on cherished local parks and community spaces.

Of course on reddit, this is complicated by some subs that are hostile to/don‚Äôt allow political posts. But you can still be a resource in these micro-communities if the topic comes up in the comments."

Harris & Walz and all Dem officials and office holders use that phrase. It's more accurate to say that Project 2025 was created for the next conservative President, which is what the Heritage Foundation says.   It does seem obvious that most of the people working on  P2025 would have major roles in a Trump administration. The Foundation is also vetting loyalists who would take over on Day One - also the day Trump says he'll be ""a dictator for a day.""

Also found a health reporter video on why Trump's lifestyle puts him at risk for cognitive decline. Would be great if someone would pull out some quotes from the video. Here is a twitter post I put together:         Cognitive Psychologist: Biden and Trump may forget names or personal details, but what counts is that ‚Äú Biden regularly displays the deliberative dispositions that characterize good decision-making . . . [He] has extensive knowledge & experience . . . & thoroughly investigates & discusses diverse viewpoints with his advisers before reaching a decision. . . Trump has considerably less experience in politics. He claims that he can make intuitive decisions in a field where he lacks knowledge by using ‚Äúcommon sense.‚Äù. This claim contradicts the research showing that extensive job-specific experience and knowledge are necessary for intuitive decisions to be consistently effective.‚Äù https://bit.ly/3Xl4jKD A health reporter compares Biden‚Äôs & Trump‚Äôs lifestyles that could affect brain health, describing Trump‚Äôs heightened risk of cognitive decline  https://youtu.be/KLvX2s50ihk"

I recommend reaching out to your county Dems office. Most counties have precinct captains who are supposed to keep in touch with residents in their precincts. Doesn't always work that way in practice, but... Anyway, reaching out to your local Dems is helpful because it avoids duplicating efforts. Plus they can help with promotion, etc.  Good luck!"

I recently found out through a sciencific study that mushrooms are being used to clean up industrial waste sites in california with a 98% success rate. Once the mushrooms suck out most of the toxins the life begins to flood back into the area at an extremely incredible rate. Items broken down and obsorbed into the mushroom include: Lead, Arsenic, and a canvas bag full of lubed soaked rages from a bicycle repair shop. Once the mushrooms are full or behing to dye they are scooped up and taken to a toxic waste incenerator, turned to ask, and taken to an special landfil for just that reason.

Oh! and its being done by the person who started the ""grow your own mushroom kits"""

Randy, too much ideology, not enough policy and realism.
What is important for economic efficiency is not capitalism, but the price system.
Interference with the price system by government OR BY PRICE-FIXING MONOPOLIES OR CARTELS are problems.
Just now realtors who loved free market rents; just had their own price-fixing outlawed.
The economic problem is not that Kamala's father might have been a marxist; it is that Kamala is a lawyer involved the court system. The court system operates by commands of a judge (according to law and legal precedent) as such is a command economy. The command model is the wrong model for the economy at large at least with respect to prices, quantities and styles generally. Long term price freezes below the price clearing level destroys supply (cartels raising prices above market clearing also causes an efficiency loss through over investment).  Price freezes are only a short term emergency fix, the long term fix is breaking up the price fixing cartels through anti-trust enforcement or artificially increasing supply through subsidies."

I have a pdf with data and graphs I would like to share. How?
Here are the main points of the summary:
The total number of unauthorized entries in the Southwest border can be estimated between a quarter and a half million, a far cry from the approximately two and a half million reported encounters! The number of visitors overstaying their authorized entry to the US is significantly higher at about one million.

Encounters include apprehensions, inadmissibles, and expulsions. Nationwide encounters are, as of July 2024, about 170 thousand a month, their lowest post-pandemic level. Border encounters are often confused with ‚Äúborder crossings,‚Äù ‚Äúborder arrests,‚Äù ‚Äúillegal entries,‚Äù or a myriad of other terms.

The number of undocumented aliens living in the United States has hovered around 11 million for the last several years.

The estimated legally resident population is about 30 million or nearly three foreign-born legal residents in the US for each undocumented foreigner.

About one million migrants become US residents legally (half through family ties) each year.
Enjoy!

As far as I could tell it was a combination of 600,000 (which is the number of 'gotaways' that Sec. of Homeland Security Mayorkas cited in a hearing) + 1.9m encounters so far in 2024 OR 2.5m encounters for 2023.

Here is an article that makes some of the same points https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/fact-checker-trump-harris-ads/  . I've worked on messaging about Kamala's role in reducing the underlying causes of migration from El Salvador, Honduras & Guatemala.  I relied on two articles  https://wapo.st/3ABKjtI   https://ampr.gs/3WNFHIt    & the White House report of the plan she worked on https://bit.ly/46SZmeA Here is my summary that can be used for messaging [comments & suggestions welcome]:  Contrary to reports that Kamala Harris was in charge of border enforcement, she was assigned to work with 3 Central American countries, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, to reduce the underlying causes of migration to the U.S.  Migrants make the tough choice to leave their homes & homeland  & head to the U.S. in order to escape extreme poverty, gang violence & corruption. 
She helped send more $4 billion in U.S. aid to those countries, including COVID vaccines. She obtained the involvement of over 50 companies that have invested  $5.2 billion & created more than 70,000 jobs. Columbia Sportswear, Nespresso, auto-parts manufacturer Yazaki North America Inc., & others created thousands of factory & farming jobs.
Her efforts were stymied by entrenched gang violence & corruption. Nonetheless, migration from the 3 countries during the Biden administration has fallen 35 percent, to a level lower than it was in 2019 under Trump. While encouraging, it‚Äôs hard to know for sure if her work on these long-term solutions helped cause this decline. ‚Äì Dan S"

If they have followers/friends, but those people‚Äôs accounts are also empty or fake-looking, that could be another sign.

It‚Äôs fairly trivial to generate an AI image for a profile photo, but generated images sometimes have errors and discrepancies.

Although astroturfing with bot accounts is getting more and more sophisticated, so it could be hard to tell for sure. If someone is acting like a bot, human or not, it‚Äôs probably just best to disengage since they are fully absorbed in their own messaging and probably not likely to re-evaluate anything."

The clarification of the ""border czar"" monicker is necessary. Working on countering the disinformation on border crossings is paramount. ProPublica confused ""border encounters"" with ""arrests"" in a report from last June. Even President Biden,
 in his speech last night said, ‚ÄúAs a result of the executive action I took, border encounters have dropped over 50%. In fact, there are fewer border crossings today than when Donald Trump left office.‚Äù Not necessarily misinformation, but confounding ‚Äúborder encounters‚Äù with ‚Äúborder crossings.‚Äù I have added these examples to the pdf, as well as the following ""emotional summary:"" It is straightforward. The yearly unauthorized entries at the border are about 1/2 a million. Meanwhile, about a million people overstay their authorized entry into the US. Another 1/2 a million people become legal residents in the US because of family ties. The number of ‚Äúencounters‚Äù last year was 2 and a half million, but encounters are not unauthorized entries into the country! No one talks about Spanish tourists being a problem, one of the worst groups overstaying their visas, or the many US citizens' family members who become legal residents too easily. But there is an outcry about the inflated number of poor brown people risking their lives to cross the desert to sustain the American economy. Why? Because disinformation about a border invasion creates fear and uncertainty and ultimately votes for anyone promising to fix the non-existing problem. Thanks again. Hope we can counter the disinformation on the issue!"

Biden's really got to me. When they were chanting 'We love Joe' they really showed him the love. I bet he's never had that happen in 50 years but now people are paying closer attention to our politics and representatives because we can't have a democracy on autopilot anymore. When he teared up I felt that. Very genuine.

I think it is important to put Inflation into perspective. In late 2021, 2022, everyone was expecting a recession. Flash foward to where we are today, it seems the recession has been avoided, and inflation is closer to being in check. 

Here is a timeline of related events.

**2021:**
Strong post-pandemic recovery but supply chain disruptions arise.
Inflation begins rising, initially seen as ""transitory.""
Fed signals tapering of bond-buying as inflation persists.

**2022:**
Russia-Ukraine war escalates inflation due to energy and food supply disruptions.
Fed and other central banks begin aggressive interest rate hikes.
Recession fears grow as yield curve inverts, signaling potential economic slowdown.
Mixed economic signals with slowing growth but resilient labor market.

**2023:**
Recession predictions emerge, but data is mixed; strong labor market persists.
Hopes for a ""soft landing"" increase as inflation eases slightly.
Fed moderates rate hikes to avoid a severe recession.
Global economic risks continue, but severe recession seems less likely.

**2024:**
Debate over mild recession vs. economic slowdown continues.
Central banks consider pausing rate hikes to balance inflation control and economic stability.

Currently seems like we're on track for a ""soft landing""
Biden: We're going to have a soft landing on inflation

Monthly U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) development 1973-2024
Published by 
Raynor de Best
, Aug 1, 2024
The US dollar index of the summer of 2023 was lower than that of the second half of 2022, although it was still relatively high compared to previous years. The index ‚Äì often referred to with the code DXY, or USDX ‚Äì measures the value of the U.S. dollars compared to six other foreign currencies at the same time. These include the euro, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, and the Swedish kr√≥na. It originated in 1973, with the arrival of the petrodollar and the dissolution of the Bretton Woods Agreement. As the index has only been updated once ‚Äì when the euro arrived in 1999 ‚Äì some argue this composition is not accurate to the current state of the world. The price development of the U.S. dollar affects many things, including commodity prices in general."

They claim that any evidence against their points is either fake, wrong, or misinterpreted.

1) Try as best you can not to become jaded by the encounters you may have that are negative or even frustrating. There are a lot of bots and spammers out there and the accounts blend pretty well so it may not really even be a US Voter. I've been an online moderator for almost 20 years and in that time you get an eye for bots etc as you will see trends in the ""talking points"" that get repeated almost verbatim. Also, sometimes its not about that specific person but the potential thousands that may read their comments and never say a word. You may not reach that person, but you could reach someone else that is undecided or reading and sees your well reasoned points or appreciates the tone of your answers.

2) People are influenced quite often by online traffic/trends. So if things seem to flow online in one direction, then people assume that must be right and DJT has managed to control the narrative and direct it where he wants it to go well and to full effect. If you read something enough times, you assume its true and I think he relies on people having zero time to look all this up and trusting on faith. IMHO he is abusing their trust. 

3) I find that sometimes asking questions is the best way to go in cases like that. Ask why they feel as they do or for more information on their views. If its a bot, they tend to stop replying or engaging and if its a person then you tend to show interest and the convo may go different and worst case scenario, anyone reading sees you are showing interest/care.

That said, always good to know when to say when (I sometimes admit to failing miserably on this so definitely easier said than done) but do the best you can. (PS Also feel free to completely ignore me too. I've never volunteered ever so not an expert on this by any means - just talking from my general work experience.) No matter what, only ever engage anyone as much as you feel comfortable. Its best for your own mental health. (Just as a general rule of online)"

Amna Nawaz:

Mr. Mayor, as you have seen, amid all the discontent, the frustration with the Biden administration's policy in Israel and towards Gaza, we have seen the Trump team conducting a lot of outreach in Michigan.

We know his former Cabinet official Richard Grenell, for example, has been on the ground and others. Is any of that outreach working? Is there an opportunity there for the Trump/Vance ticket?

Abdullah Hammoud: (mayor of Dearborn MI)

There is no opportunity whatsoever.

They have certainly reached out to some members, but the individuals they have spoken with don't represent or speak on behalf of the community in any regard. I can tell you that nobody who I have spoken with, even some of the conservative constituents that I represent, have also expressed great disdain for the Trump/Vance ticket, because they understand what a Trump presidency represents.

This is an individual who is vocal about wanting to bring back a Muslim ban in new fashion and new order. This is the president who moved the embassy to Jerusalem, who eliminated all humanitarian aid relief toward Palestinians in the budget that he passed during his time.

This is somebody that recognized the annexation of the Golan Heights and the annexation of illegal settlements. This is somebody that armed Saudi Arabia that killed 30,000 people in Yemen. And so we very much understand what Trump represents as a president and that is not something anybody wants to see this November."

Though it is a very small and splintered segment of people, there are people who identify as various kinds of socialists and communists and who cluster in various overlapping ways around political parties like the Worker‚Äôs World Party, but also the Democratic Socialists of America. These groups are extremely rigid, and to remain in them one has to adhere to certain positions. AOC, for example, was backed by the DSA, who have now washed their hands of her (in a dumb move on their part) because she wouldn‚Äôt refer to the situation in Gaza as ‚Äògenocide‚Äô.

I‚Äôll only comment now specifically to the WWP and that mentality because I used to affiliate with them in 2002-2003 when I lived in DC. The WWP uses hot-button issues like Gaza to recruit activists and then proceeds to radicalize the activists around a revolutionary socialist agenda. In my day they used the War in Iraq and those huge rallies we had to try and prevent the war were organized in part by the activist front groups of the WWP. Not that a large percentage of the people protesting knew that or would have cared. We were all sincerely against the war. Just‚Ä¶ the difference between liberal democratic resistance and the far left resistance to the War in Iraq was one of persuading people to start voting democratic and support anti-war democratic candidates in primaries and generals. In the far left circles I used to move in, we saw both political parties as faces of capitalism and the main goal was to work to overthrow capitalism and use anti-war sentiment to radicalize people for that purpose. 

It sounds way out there. But it‚Äôs true. We had public activist meetings where leaders from the WWP regularly spoke and over time slowly amped up the anti-capitalist rhetoric. Meanwhile, behind the scenes for folks like me who were already essentially old school communists, we had reading groups and read things like *The State and Revolution* by Lenin, or stuff from Trotsky, and we‚Äôd strategize around the longer term goal of anti-capitalism.

The WWP is still around and one can go to their website. They are doing the same thing with Gaza that they did with the Iraq War. 

Many protesters, I assume, are not ‚Äòhard left‚Äô like this, and those who aren‚Äôt will, I strongly suspect, will come home. Those who are hard left kinda need to be dealt with the same one would engage MAGAists‚Ä¶

For me‚Ä¶ I ‚Äòleft‚Äô the Democratic party in the late 90s, but then I came back in 2008, then truly came back (changed my registration from I to D) in 2016. Obama, then Bernie + the Clinton general election campaign brought me back.

In short. Don‚Äôt sweat the pro-palestinian protestors. I hope Harris/Walz address it, but I trust their judgment."

I hope every day our demands for a ceasefire & humanitarian aid are met - NOW.  War crimes have been committed by Israel from the start.   I want to keep my power with a president I can influence so I'll vote for Kamala - with her, we will live in democracy, not dictatorship""  I know people who've gone from not voting to a vote for Harris by listening to AOC : ‚ÄúI would rather, even in places of stark disagreement, I would rather be organizing under the conditions of Biden as an opponent on an issue than Trump, who is not‚Ä¶ he seeks to dismantle American democracy.‚Äù Under Trump ""we will not be able to organize for any movement towards anything if we are facing the jailing of dissidents.

If I want clips I use Realplayer or other software. If the speech is on C-Span they have a clipping feature. For rural voters there is none better than Tim Walz --  the coach who worked on grandparents farm in summer. Go beyond his speeches to include photos like the one in tee shirt holding a pig & the video of him with daughter at state fair.  Short policy statements can be added. I found Gov Shapiro''s full speech in seconds and guess others will be there too May your work be filled with joy & laughter .https://youtu.be/HZRXjOBeJIA

MAGA also bash ""sanctuary cities"".  Here is one way I have posted on them: ""SANCTUARY CITIES ARE SAFE Trump continues to rail against ‚Äúsanctuary cities.‚Äù His Agenda 47 will block federal grants to them. Yet, ‚Äúsanctuary communities‚Äù are as safe as other communities, with no difference in rates of violent crime, rape, or property crime. They are likely to decrease crime because immigrant victims are much more willing to call the police. They do NOT shield immigrants from deportation. Murders by undocumented immigrants are heartbreaking tragedies but, fortunately, are rare. Such murders in Houston, Athens, GA, Grand Rapids MI & Poweshiek County IA, were not in ‚Äòsanctuary‚Äô locations. https://bit.ly/4f2kFyl  https://bit.ly/4f7NjOs   https://bit.ly/3LXowPN"

Migrants make the tough choice to leave their homes & homeland to make the arduous & dangerous journey to the U.S. in order to escape extreme poverty, gang violence & corruption. 
Harris helped send more $4 billion in U.S. aid to those countries, including COVID vaccines. She obtained the involvement of over 50 companies that have invested $5.2 billion & created more than 70,000 jobs. Columbia Sportswear, Nespresso, auto-parts manufacturer Yazaki North America & others created thousands of factory & farming jobs.
Her efforts were stymied by entrenched gang violence & corruption. Nonetheless, migration from the 3 countries during the Biden-Harris administration has fallen 35 percent, to a level lower than it was in 2019 under Trump. While encouraging, it‚Äôs hard to know if her work on these long-term solutions helped produce this decline. https://wapo.st/3ABKjtI https://ampr.gs/3WNFHIt https://bit.ly/46SZmeA"

I just wanted to throw in a vaguely educated response to why things are the way they are. Hi. I'm Evren. I have a master's degree in international affairs (foreign policy) from Pitt. I am NOT a middle east expert by any stretch, but I do know a few relevant things that people need to keep in mind. 

1. Foreign relationships are very complicated (as someone else said). We have treaties, agreements, and obligations that we have to honor unless we meet very VERY strict guidelines for doing otherwise. 

2. We have military bases in Israel. We will not just abandon them. This is a strategic ally when dealing with the Middle East. Be aware: Caliphates are not prone to human rights. At all. It is not a bad thing to keep an eye on things. Look up the Ottoman Empire. Muslims have overrun Europe before. DO NOT assume they are all keen to just keep to themselves. 

3. Mind you, they also kill LGBT folk in their own countries and even young adults that marry against their parents' wishes (honor killings). Muslims here are not the same as Muslims there in all cases (not trying to vilify ""all"" anyone, just this liberal bias towards Muslim protection will not be afforded to you necessarily). 

4. Civilian damage should absolutely be minimized in any war. There is no excuse for what BeBe has done here. He saw this as the perfect opportunity to wipe Palestinians out. He's a garbage extremist and so is some of his cabinet. We have to try to get a ceasefire deal. Period.

5. We are not able to ""remove him"" or take over. That is not however the world works. We cannot declare war or any such nonsense. Whether or not anyone thinks Israel should exist, it does (I am not a zionist, but I accept that this is where we are). We have to deal with it now as it is."

I tried making that point a couple days ago [8-22 3:09 PM] - As you probably know, messaging gurus, such as those who teach deep canvassing, say we need to start with empathy & a search for common ground - there's a great video of David Hogg going to a gun range & how he built a relationship with a gun owner. Here is part of what I wrote: I want to keep reaching out. Am concerned that if  20,000 of the 100,000 stay home [in MI], which is progress, it could still make Trump president. So I start with deep empathy & our common ground with resisters -- 'My heart breaks also at the deaths of Palestinians & the destruction of Gaza. I fear every day I'll see more bodies, men, women and babies. I have deep, deep anger & sadness that I also sense in you. I hope every day our demands for a ceasefire & humanitarian aid are met - NOW.  War crimes have been committed by Israel from the start.   I want to keep my power with a president I can influence so I'll vote for Kamala - with her, we will live in democracy, not dictatorship"""

I will ask that too.  But I am also asking what will their life look like when Cheeto Jesus(I say Trump while talking to voters) makes drastic cuts to social security and takes away their healthcare and eliminates the ability to get overtime pay.  The impact to their quaity of life will be massive.  That is waking a lot of people up out of the trance.  I'll never forget the teacher in Wisconsin who was intererviewed after Scott Walker took away the right to collective bargaining for public workers.  She was a religious fundamentalist who had voted on only one issue - abortion.  She did not consider that she would lose the only pathway for wage increases and wage equality and her bottom line was, in the end, the most important issue to her.  Many people will be poorer if Trump wins."

These people all participated in attacking President Biden CONSTANTLY for weeks. While they gave Dumpty Trumpty a total pass for all his lies & complete insanity! They give him free media, just like they did in 2016, to rant. Whatever these things are they ARE NOT press conferences or interviews!
If Trump gets back in it's going to be because our mainstream media treated him as if he's just a normal candidate when they KNOW he is not!
I would like to recommend that she do her first sit down interview with Ben Meisalas of the MeidasTouch Network. Almost 3 million people now subscribe to that channel & that's where we get our news. It is NOT a Democrat or Republican or left or right wing outlet. MeidasTouch is THE PRO-DEMOCRACY NETWORK! 
I'm quite sure Ben would do a fair, respectful interview.  He has interviewed President Biden in the recent past.
Our media needs to learn that until they start being fair & reporting the ABSOLUTE TRUTH (which includes NOT allowing other to use their platform to spread lies & propaganda) they certainly don't DESERVE to be rewarded with interviews or press conferences that they DEMAND! 
I know she doesn't need my advice but I think when she sits down to talk it should be with someone who actually cares about the truth & being fair. MeidasTouch doesn't say they are ""fair & balanced"" lol, they simply say ""MeidasTouch because the TRUTH is GOLDEN!""
I hope someone on her campaign sees this.
Thanks."

Biden won by only 43,000 votes in 3 states. I am preparing a document that has Kamala's positions, the voices of uncommitted resisters & the words of progressives that can help open dialogue.  Kamala and Joe have worked together on the ceasefire, hostage release & humanitarian aid. She has some daylight from but not much - she callled for ceasefire a little earlier for example & she's had more dialogue with resisters. Resisters liked her call for Palestinian self-determination in  DNC speech but understandably did not like her referencing sexual assault of Israelis but not Gazans. She gives MUCH more policy detail in her 8-25 statement -- I posted on this channel.  Most resisters are long-time Democrats who know very well the threat of Trump & reminders may not help & may be insulting [see CNN focus gp with uncommitted]. I will not create words to point out the down side of 1 issue voting but use the words of AOC [see my earlier post of her video], Bernie Sanders & others.  Dialogue obviously works. A prime example -  Kamala's conversion with the Dearborn mayor won him over. The refusal to have a vetted Palestinian speaker at the DNC who would have endorsed Kamala, may have cost Kamala tens of thousands of votes or more, e.g. Muslim Women for Kamala disbanded & will no longer back her. I suggest Kamala try hard to repair the damage- perhaps a major national event with Ruwa Romman giving her speech, hearing from the Dearborn mayor etc. -- basically for her to say what she did to protesters in AZ - I hear you and I see you."

Some of it seems to be actual MAGA and some of it is almost certainly bots (just judging from account history/timelines/etc., some common grammar mistakes, no profile pic, etc.)

So I'd guess there is some kind of hybrid campaign going on (especially with the Ukraine offensive happening) by Russian assets to both provoke people into stating specific misinformation and stoke leftist infighting.

On YouTube they are targeting anything that comes up in the ""In the News"" section, so I'd be curious as to the contours of the targets on TT and reddit, if you have any sense of it.

I've been reporting accounts a lot but other than that the only thing I could think to do is apply some kind of counter resources. Kind of difficult to do, though.

Report, amplify the people fighting back, respond quickly if you can, note where it was, a general sense of what was said, and how much there was.

We might be able to get some investigative journalist on it as election interference stuff but I'm not sure how that would go trying to get Google to cooperate (a nonstarter with TT and reddit, I would imagine)"

I think another way to go about it is emphasizing the need to not sabotage one's own capacity to advocate for them. 

If Harris wins, those protesting for Palestine will still be fighting for them.
If Trump wins, they won't. They'll be too busy fighting for their own survival here to dedicate any time or resources to what's going on there."

The main drive behind this is that back in November an overarching feeling of accelerationist thinking kinda took hold in a lot of leftist circles of ‚Äúif both parties suck on the response to this then screw it nobody should be in charge‚Äù which I noticed gave a pretty big opening for some extremely divisive ideas to take hold. 

Personally, Palestine and Israel is a topic I rarely touch because I agree with a lot of what is being said but I‚Äôm also realistic enough to know that not voting and handing the keys to a lunatic who would rather see the Middle East a new parking lot and me dead is‚Ä¶unhelpful for everyone.

That note, charted the course of history for women‚Äôs rights all the way up to this present day. The fundamental rights written in the Constitution, was not a given for women.

J.D. Vance‚Äôs life story, as told in ‚ÄúHillbilly Elegy,‚Äù resonated with me when I first read it. I was a product of generational poverty, with deep roots in the Deep South. I was a teenage mom, kicked out of high school, surrounded by all the social ills described by Vance. I was regularly told, by family, acquaintances, and society, that I would never, and could never, amount to anything. 

I almost believed it, but not quite. While still a teenager, I created a plan of escape. I started spending time with people who lived stable lives full of purpose. I earned my GED. I went to community college, where I became Student Senate President. I worked tirelessly to improve conditions for the 40,000 students I served. I did this while also a full-time mama, a full-time honors student and mama, and working part-time."

UW-Madison. After 12 years as a full-time college student, I graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs, master‚Äôs, and Ph.D. For the next 15 years, I worked in higher education, helping students like myself get the education they needed to create the lives they wanted. 

Unlike Vance, that journey I took from a girl preoccupied with day-to-day survival, to the young woman who found power and purpose in serving, to the woman I am now, determined to do what is best for my country and ALL its people, ensured I became a Democrat. 

Perhaps the difference is Vance is a lawyer, while I am a social scientist. Being a woman, and thus, the target of antiquated and misogynistic attitudes like Vance‚Äôs, also helped.

I know that every American, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, deserves a comfortable, secure, fulfilling life, and they can achieve it with hard work, support, respect, and HOPE. 

That is what the Democratic Party is all about. We are the party that rewards hard work, not inherited wealth. We support education and jobs that enable all Americans to create the life they want. We respect the choices our neighbors make- what they read, who they love, how they identify themselves, and what they do with their own bodies. The Democratic Party is the party of hope, because we are the party for all who believe in a good, loving, fair, and just America. We got your back. Now let‚Äôs win this thing, together!"

When Tyson hikes the price of chicken without paying farmers or packers more (gouging) that filters into the local store because it paid more for the product. A ban on gouging (if written properly) would hit Tyson, not the bodega. Similarly, big chains can negotiate for lower prices from suppliers in ways small grocery stores cannot. Failing to pass those savings onto the consumer or laborer (in the form of wages and benefits) is also a form of gouging."

A full half of today‚Äôs inflation, they discovered, stems from ongoing supply chain issues as producers struggle to push out enough goods to meet demand. The war in Ukraine and resulting energy shortage, alongside a turbulent housing market, have also contributed to inflation, pushing up prices from several directions at once.‚Äù - https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/08/25/does-government-spending-cause-inflation/"

It's in keeping with then DA Harris, and now VP Harris' respect and integrity for the law.  She has never interpreted the law according to her desire for what it should be. She works with what it is. But she has also been concerned for victims and the accused. Her supporters call her pragmatic.  Corey Cook, a political scientist and provost at St. Mary's College, and a longtime observer of San Francisco politics said, ""She's [Harris} not an ideologue,, she tends to focus on specific problems. 
""The idea that she would have consistent positions on issues informed by ideology isn't who she is,"" said Cook.  And   ... Harris' focus on the victims of abuse and exploitation continued after she was elected as San Francisco's District Attorney. ""I don't know what the term 'teenage prostitute' means. I have never met a 'teenage prostitute.' I have met exploited kids.""  Harris then ordered her prosecutors not to use the term in court. A year later, Harris sponsored a bill putting the crime of human trafficking into the state criminal code.  For me, I see her position in the Catholic priest issue as very consistent with her ability to make hard decisions and do unpopular things because it's the right thing to do. https://www.factcheck.org/2024/08/trumps-false-and-misleading-claims-about-harris-record-on-crime/   https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/the-real-kamala-harris-what-her-california-years-19579143.php"

1. inflation: The FED targets 2% inflation. The expectation in a growth economy is that ""normal"" price increases are always going to be 2%-3%. Too low, is bad for economic growth. Too high, is bad for all of us consumers. Different sectors of the economy have different historical inflation rates (housing vs medical vs college vs food/groceries).
2. Vice President isn't really capable of controlling inflation. President has more control over that, but it's largely a function of Federal Reserve policy. I also like to speak to friends about U.S. inflation versus other advanced economic countries - U.S. brought down inflation much faster than every other country in the world. 
3. Tariffs passed during 2016-2020 also drove inflation for years to come on numerous products. A bike I bought my son at REI in 2017 was about 30% more expensive just 9 months later after Trump instittuted tarrifs targeted at China. We can agree or disagree with the purpose of tariffs - but they absolutely get passed on to the consumer. Trump wants even higher tariffs if he's elected in 2024. 
4. Harris is campaigning on combating price gouging - this is not the same as price controls. 

These talk points are only used with my social media community - i don't get into this while phone or text banking, and keep it much higher level. But, if you're trying to engage people who are listening in good faith -  you can google some of what I said above and find plenty of stories and data to reference. The bike story for me is really personal because i couldn't believe how much more it was when I went to buy another one for my younger child. The impact was quite swift."

Every one of the speakers is a committed Swiftie [including 78-year-old Ed Markey} & could discuss favorite Swift songs & albums. Carole King talked about her friendship with Taylor & sees herself as Taylor‚Äôs grandmother.  Would be lovely to have one 4-5 minute video of some key speakers talking about their love for her music. One of several summaries of the event is here.

Taylor is pretty quiet when it comes to politics. But did you know she‚Äôs had some things to say about Donald Trump?  In response to a comment Trump made during the George Floyd protests in 2020, she posted: ""After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? We will vote you out in November."""

Trump Didn‚Äôt Say He Would Vote for Florida‚Äôs Pro-Abortion Access Referendum: Under pressure from the anti-abortion activists in the party, Trump immediately walked back his statement. His spokesperson put out a statement saying that Trump didn‚Äôt mean to suggest how he would vote in Florida this fall. He wants to keep his position fuzzy. Since Trump‚Äôs position is that abortion is up to the states, we should assume he is voting to uphold Florida‚Äôs state ban until he explicitly says otherwise.

Trump Doesn‚Äôt Support Protecting IVF: Trump has refused to support, and his running mate voted against, efforts to enshrine protections for IVF."

Republicans Will Protect and Defend a Vote of the People, from within the States, on the Issue of Life
""We proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).""

No one tried to be rude or ""catch"" me in anything, it was all respectful, just at the end of the night we wound up having like an hour long parking lot conversation about politics

Claims that I tried my best to wade through while very tired:
 - Biden is currently mentally unfit for office if Harris is stepping in, and the whole thing is shady
 - It's ironic that Harris is supporting a ""border wall"" (I'd never heard of this and just said she supports the bipartisan bill)
 - Protections against price gouging and fixing ""did not go well in some other countries"" ie it's communist and will ruin the country - I do not know enough about the policies or economics to speak to this, though of course it's not what I think
 - There's nothing to stop people buying and selling homes to raise the price of homes another 25k if they know someone is going to be getting it
 - Something about the child tax credit being $6000 one year, then half of that the next, then half the year after or gone?

My friend said that his source for some of this is campaign materials. There isn't a policy page on the website. May I ask where I can go for policy resources? May I ask if anyone knows about any of these things or has a good way to respond?

Thank you!"

Take heart. The first two are far, far more common and they're trying to bait you into some sort of emotional reaction. As for the rare last person, be cautious, don't let them take over the conversation with their rhetoric, and find a way to end the contact. Sometimes, people are just not ready to hear anything that isn't confirmed by their world view.

I have had some success redirecting the conversation by asking where/who/how/when a person or a group got the information ""so I can look it up later"" and then changing or re-engaging on a facet of the conversation or a safer talking point.

You are not alone and you got this!"

- how you navigated to the page including what dection it was under if it was labeled. (This is for how they are targeting)
- how long the video has been up
- how many views it has
- how many likes
- how many comments (just the number, you don't need to count the bot ones manually that's too much work)
- screenshots of the comments

As you're doing this you can report everything if you'd like. Again, the point is to collect data, not fight the fire yourself, but it always makes me feel better to do some reporting. xD

I'm putting a guide together with examples but I don't yet have a place to put it.

Last note: important to remember they have to do this because they don't actually have people naturally commenting on these videos, so it's a sign of electoral weakness."

When Obama ran for President, I told people he was going to win, and win big, because not only did he have a better message, but because he recognized early on how to use social media to his advantage. I think that in 2016, Trump won because he figured it out and utilized it better than Hillary did. This year, I am BLOWN AWAY at how the Harris campaign is taking it to new heights by getting all of us involved. Trump is a social media organization of one (two if you count Elon). For fun, I went to the volunteer sites for both campaigns. The difference, like everything else, is stark and, like Obama, beyond having a better message, we are kicking *ss when it comes to social media engagement - and that's what's going to give us our first female President!

Kinda need to know the topography/landscape beyond corporations handwaving and asking to regulate themselves.

To get a feel for the disconnect between where we are vs. what these companies are telling us vs. policy, I invite anyone to read Ch. 7 of P2025 (the section on Cyber and Intelligence) and download the text of the TikTok Ban bills, which didn't pass.

1) I have no evidence this does anything. (If someone else does lmk)
2) Yes, this is effective on your own videos. For other people's videos, you want to thumbs down and report any comments on their vids (ideally after collecting data). For disinfo videos you want to make sure you don't watch more than 20 seconds of the video, report. But don't thumbs down the video (that's engagement)
3) Leaving it alone is a solid option if you don't have time or are exhausted. Collecting the url of the video would be helpful."

I wouldn't be surprised if this was meant simultaneously to distract us, make us mad at our fellow citizens, and activate the worst and most corrupted of MAGA.

Here is what I did: I first opened Mobilize in my browser and it already had me logged in on my gmail account. I then logged out of Mobilize so I could look for a subscribe button or option so I could set up an account using my Comcast e-mail account, BUT there was no subscribe button or option. Somehow when I take a training session in Mobilize, I never get an e-mail in either e-mail account... not even in my gmail-based Mobilize account which has settings set for me to receive e-mails via gmail after events. This has been really frustrating. Also for some reason, when I sign up for a Mobilize event, I only get the links by text and NEVER by e-mail."

I could use help engaging with people on Lex Fridman‚Äôs Youtube podcasts page to politely push back on Lex‚Äôs interview with Donald Trump. Lex has 4.17 MILLION subscribers, 1.64 MILLION views of his interview with Trump and over 34,000 comments on this episode on Youtube since the interview was posted 9 hours ago. Lex's audience has MANY moderates, although most of the comments so far are supportive of the Trump interview. The moderate viewers who regularly watch or listen to Lex are probably a bit shy to comment against the Trump interview, so I think it would be helpful if volunteers from our online engagement team chime in on the Youtube page for this episode to politely criticize Lex for failing to push back on some of Trump‚Äôs major lies and to educate people commenting on the interview.

Here is the link: https://youtu.be/qCbfTN-caFI

To see my comments, look for my @joec143 Google handle. I politely criticized Lex for his failure to push back more aggressively on these topics:

- Trump suggestion that Hillary Clinton should have been sent to prison.

- Trump calling the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù.

- No push back on Trump saying he knew nothing about Project 2025.

- No push back on Trump blaming Biden for the messed up withdrawal from Afghanistan, ignoring Trump‚Äôs role in that mess.

I live in a neighborhood where a lot of Trump supporters proudly fly their MAGA flags. I took a risk by openly supporting Kamala Harris, both online and by displaying political statements at my house. Today, after dropping my kid off at school, a neighbor I‚Äôd never spoken to pulled me aside and said, ‚ÄòWe LOVE your Kamala Harris flags!‚Äô

That moment reminded me‚Äîit only takes ONE person to stand up for what they believe in. Many of us feel the same way but are afraid to speak up. Today, I got confirmation that I will NEVER stay silent. Let‚Äôs get it done! üíôüá∫üá∏üí™üèΩ"

But when I asked if she watched anything about Kamala, she said no and she won't because both parties are liars. It's this attitude that worries me the most."

She said, in tears, that he has been passed over for promotions 5-6 times in the last 6 years and the jobs went to unqualified DEI candidates. She said he feels totally void of all value. Her pain was real .We love each other very much and have agreed that politics will not change that. She and I have always validated each other's feelings.  Feelings aren't right or wrong, they just are. There's nothing I can do to convince her. It's just that I wonder how many others there are like her.

You respond by saying how this just shows how Walz is even more like the rest of us in America.  Many have lost friends and family and have been divided because of a man who tries to overthrow our government once and will do it again in a heartbeat.   Then share your story about friends or family you've lost due to Trump.  It's really impactful and flips the script.

We need to counter the false narrative of the opposition and we do so with our trusted voice with the folks in our networks.  I'm from Western PA.  If we vote, we win.  Our people hold the key and we need to be engaged and ready to get out the vote.  That means constant contact for the next 60 days.  I've had friends say that I'm posting too much political stuff, and ten times as many friends have countered this claim with encouragement to do even more posting.  We also need to engage our friends in conversation and get them engaged.  I've now had over 500 conversations with people in my network confirming their vote and encouraging them to download REACH and get to work.  So far, over 30 of my friends have downloaded the app and are doing organizing for the campaign.  I am reaching out in my neighborhood, in my faith groups, in my social groups, and in my political groups.  I will leave no stone unturned in my networks.  We are the ones we've been waiting for.  If we don't want Agent Orange in the White House destroying democracy and threatening our children's future and our present, the time for engagement is NOW.  Let's get our friends and family on REACH and help them to use their voice in the digital sphere and in face-to-face conversations with their friends."

Those who benefit/depend on Social Security, Medicare if they are older or approaching retirement. Those that used the GI Bill for service members to go to college, like Coach Walz and JD Vance. Those that receive food assistance. FEMA and the National Guard to help recover from disasters and rebiuld communities, etc."

Trump vowed to vastly reshape the federal bureaucracy on Saturday in a wide-ranging, often unfocused speech at a rally in Wisconsin.

He pledged to ultimately eliminate the Department of Education, redirect the efforts of the Justice Department and fire civil servants charged with carrying out Biden administration policies that he disagreed with.

[***]

Many of the proposals in Mr. Trump‚Äôs speech align with plans reported by The New York Times to conduct a broad expansion of presidential power over government, and to effectively concentrate more authority within the White House, if he wins in November.

And many of his pledges dovetailed with the stated goals and proposals of Project 2025, an effort by a group of conservative organizations to develop policies for the next Republican president. """

It's not just you. Some of the more popular lives and progressive-leaning creators are being mass reported. For example, The Meidas Touch Network's official TT page was just restored via community outreach and behind-the-scenes legal scuffling.

The Good News: Should you receive a CGV, you can appeal and, more often than not, the content will be restored.

The Meh News: Even the best of us might forget to use softer/alternate language for ""adult"" themes or subjects in the heat of the moment. Examples of alternative language can include: Unaliving, the skull emoji, the water gun emoji or pew-pew, self-deletion, pig latin, and/or smooshing syllables.

Lastly, take heart! The candidate campaign has had at least 18-months to prepare for the run so it may seem overwhelming or more organized (SPOILER: They're not); compare that with what we've cobbled together in a handful of weeks.

We got this! We keep going."

STOP SAYING T***P. DON'T SAY HIS NAME. EVER. JUST DON'T.  Call him Donald, Donny, Don, the former president, 45, the sex convict, the distinguished felon from New York, the man who's name sounds like plump,... whatever, just do not ever say his name. 

It's a brand created by grandpa Drumpf. He puts it on everything. It's on the top of buildings written in our skylines. It is his ego writ large and the most important thing to him. 

You and I have the power to take that away from him by refusing to speak it. Attention is the currency of our age and everytime you say his name you are paying him.

If we all stop using the T word, he will go nuts and make a mistake. The algorithms will suddenly stop promoting him as much if the name drops in usage. It won't come up as much in search if no one is saying it. 

He has reduced politics to a simple name recognition contest. Take that name away and he's nothing. 

I guarantee if Kamala doesn't say the T word once in the debate, she wins, and he will be visibly shaken. 

Your voice is your power. His name is his power. Use your silence to end his violence.

This is a good opportunity to ask some follow up questions and figure out what is important to the responder.

For example: Ask them in what ways their life has been more difficult under the Biden/Harris administration. Don't be afraid to ask them to get specific about policy.

Sometimes, they'll list off a bunch of things right off the bat (or try to steam roll you). Another technique is to ask them which is the most important or to take the points one at a time.

From there, apply the ABCs (Acknowledge their concern, Bridge with facts, Connect with a story of your own).

Lastly, you may find that folks are a little fuzzy on how our government works and what the VP is consitutionally empowered to do.

Good Luck!"

It can feel like a broken record or running on a treadmill (and not getting anywhere).

More often than not, these are teachable moments to those who are reading along or watching silently in the background. If nothing else, the exchange provides a counter-example of a behavior no one wants.

What helps me is to remember I am speaking to someone who is scared and when we're scared, it's really tough to take a beat and think things through.

Depending upon who it is, I have had some success getting really granular and breadcrumbing those steps away from fear to something a little more balanced.

It's a dance between outreach and protecting your peace.

I get by with frequent breaks and lots of snacks"

It often doesn‚Äôt help I purposely ‚Äúwade into the deep end‚Äù as it were with the folks I choose to engage with online. But they are the loudest and my hope is like you said. Going after the most extreme seems to be the loudest way to be heard. And hopefully someone else who reads or listens to what I‚Äôm saying hears something they need to. It‚Äôs just unfortunate that it seems you have to engage with the biggest extremes to try and actually have any reach in what you say.

but every once in a while you find someone who's wanting to listen, but might be too afraid to ask. or might be politically illiterate (as is most people i'd imagine). i found my best success with those who had a specific concern/minority and addressing that to get them interested."

Maybe they don't know who she is. We can talk about difficulty after the debate (I don't want to minimize reality). But for now, she can preach to the choir, we amplify her message.

Sen Ed Markey MA 45:38
Representative from ‚ÄúVote from Abroad‚Äù 1:16:30

Every one of the speakers is a committed Swiftie [including 78-year-old Ed Markey}. They each shared their favorite Swift songs and albums. 
Carole King talked about her friendship with Taylor & called herself Taylor‚Äôs grandmother.  I think a powerful video would be a compilation of 5-6 speakers telling about their Swiftie song favorites. Moderators -- please send this idea to Content Creators"

I know this is common thinking but today she called her a ‚Äúcop funded by Israel and will keep sending bombs to them for the genocide of the Palestinian people‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know how to engage with her on this. My biggest concern is that she won‚Äôt vote for anyone which will benefit Trump due to how our current system is structured and funded. Any tips on how to engage welcome!  I tried searching the chat but it just brought up Jill Stein stuff which isn‚Äôt relevant here. Thanks

In general, keep in mind that our goal is to engage people who are unsure, need more information, or lean towards supporting Kamala and Democrats. It's okay to not engage here if you don't feel like the conversation will be productive. If you do choose to engage, I'd focus on sharing your personal reasons for supporting Kamala and emphasizing her dedication to moving our country forward -- opening up the opportunity for dialogue across international and domestic issues in a way that Trump has made clear will not happen if he's elected to a second term."

I was thinking about this because I just finished the phone bank for about an outreach group that I'm on the board of and a lady brought up about how a lot of people don't realize that with a lot of these laws and a lot of these bills and whatnot it takes Congress to approve them before the president signs off on them.

Harris said something during the debate yesterday: ""And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.""

The fact that he lifted the Obama era restrictions on civilian casualties basically in every single case and almost started a hot war with Iran seem like good points to form a message around. Not sure how to form that beyond the mere facts. Data on additional civilian deaths I guess?

This Vox article might be helpful for anyone interested in crafting a message.

Last night debate was good! Trump showed his true self and when someone shows you who they are, BELIEVE IT. BELIEVE THEM. We all know our assignment. Vote BLUE all the way to the ballot box üó≥Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üíô

Trump never answered the debate questions. He didn't speak on his policies/plans for the future.  What he did do was attack America with fear, (crime, illegal border crossing, racism, division, discord, chaos, economy collapse, people eating dogs and cats, etc...). 
The world üåé will not collapse. America üá∫üá∏ will NOT fall apart as Trump spoke. Trump attacked America, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and others. Not one good thing did he speak on how to make America great.

I am sorry there are people in your comment sections being disingenuous and worse.

My suggestion is to resubmit and to take a screenshot of the comment. Be sure to include the date(s) and time(s). Same goes for your initial report.

Try resubmitting the report again with the screenshots.

After taking the screenshots and resubmitting, delete the comment to protect your peace.

While my personal preference is to keep such things/not to dirty delete, I understand that deleting and moving on is sometimes the better option in the long run.

Good Luck!"

Keep submitting reports to FB. 

If it‚Äôs super threatening, call your local police. If you have the person‚Äôs phone number or address, they might call them and let them know they‚Äôve made (whatever the threat amounts to) and could be charged now, but they usually give a warning.

‚ÄúWe Can Stand Together‚Äù
By Bruce & Michelle Marshall ¬† ¬©2024
""When some turn a blind eye to justice, and bury their heads in the sand;
We could squander this opportunity don't let it slip through our hands.
Now I'm feeling a sea change upon us, I ask is it pre-ordained?
If we don't take action and face all the facts, we could be forever changed.
CHORUS
We can¬†stand together,¬†Give our future this¬†chance,.
Will we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you stand.
We can¬†stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.
Our Children will carry that mantle if given the chance.
Now some say it's part of a cycle, some say it's part of a scheme;
Some say it's fate now old mother nature is coming apart at the seams.
Now most of us want all the same things, a world without bias and strife.
The same opportunity once and for all is every American's right.
CHORUS
We can¬†stand together,¬†Give our future this¬†chance,.
Will we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you stand.
We can¬†stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.
Our children will carry that mantle if given the chance.
So go blame society,¬†go say your piece and cherish your deep held beliefs.
And all that had mattered got all torn and tattered, history always repeats.
When some turn a blind eye to justice and then quote scripture and verse;
When hypocrisy rules we call out the fools and we all take a turn for the worse.
We can¬†stand together,¬†Give our future this¬†chance;¬†
Would we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you stand?
We can¬†stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.
Our children will carry that mantle if given the chance.
We can¬†stand together¬†we can strengthen the ties.
We can't let this new found common ground get tossed by the wayside.
We can¬†stand for freedom. We can¬†stand for freedom.""

I have found this site useful in terms of accurate data and visuals:
https://www.eia.gov/

Public misunderstandings of the energy markets I have encountered in the wild include:
- Energy is a global market. Not all countries/continents have similar levels of resources and thus we trade.
- Who/what OPEC is and how that affects crude oil pricing
- Our refining capacity
- That our country operates at an energy deficit and while we have made strides toward energy independence, we still have room to explore and grow
- The transportation and supply demands during 2020-2021 and Trump's 2-year OPEC+ deal...
- Which in turn had disastrous effects on small-to-midsize energy companies here
- We continue to be the leading exporter of Liquid Nitrogen Gas (LNG); but fracking has negative impacts on the environment
- Under Biden/Harris, we have more leases and are pumping more crude, but we lack the capacity to refine it
- Once the pandemic was declared over, supply demands increased, but the OPEC+ deal continues to keep the global supply low

And Two pipelines: Keystone & Keystone XL
- Keystone XL was a project by TransCanada Corp/TC Energy started in 2008
- Keystone is still operating; Keystone XL was shelved in 2021 because it violated the Clean Water Act, didn't meet NEPA requirements, and crossed tribal lands (remember the protests?)
- Tar sands/tar sand oil is dirtier and more difficult to refine than crude"

Let Russia take Ukraine, let China take Taiwan. America will lose the status of World Leader forever. Who would dare to trust America, when America abandon its longtime ally. 
Trump is so weak to surrender to Putin. NATO is our shield against Russia's advance. Trump will not support NATO. A weak NATO will cause harm to America's safety.

What I have discovered out here in these Social Media Streets is folks are misinformed about the difference between an asylum seeker, a refugee, migrant workers/day laborers, and folks whose visas have expired. Some of these people have documents, some don't, and some are in the process of completing their immigration.

Asylum is a legal process and I would encourage you to look up 8 USC 1158--and have that handy.
(Once someone sets foot on US soil, they can claim asylum. You don't have to go through a port of entry.)

The percentage of asylum seekers who are granted asylum in the U.S. varies depending on the specific time frame and the type of asylum case. Here are the key points:

- Overall Grant Rate: Historically, about 30-40% of asylum seekers who go through the U.S. immigration system are granted asylum. This includes both affirmative cases (where the seeker is not in removal proceedings) and defensive cases (where asylum is sought as a defense against deportation)
- Recent Trends: In recent years, the grant rate has fluctuated. For example, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, around 46% of asylum seekers were granted asylum. Defensive asylum cases, which make up a larger portion of total cases, typically see a slightly lower grant rate, closer to 39%.
- Comparison to Total Applications: While about 70% of asylum seekers may initially pass the ""credible fear"" screening, which allows them to stay in the U.S. while their case is processed, only about 20-30% ultimately qualify for asylum through the full legal process.

These numbers highlight the challenges faced by asylum seekers in navigating the U.S. immigration system, where a significant portion of applicants are ultimately not granted asylum despite being allowed to stay in the country temporarily during the process."

1) We are and have been under 8 USC for 60 years and that included during Trump's term.

2) In 2020, Trump had the power under Title 42 to declare a public health emergency. Biden wanted to extend it in anticipation of the processing backlog, but SCOTUS ruled the request unconstitutional since the pandemic was over.

3) The comprehensive border bill authored by R-Langford was shot down in the house because Trump wanted to run on it. Harris wants that bill back on the floor and has stated she will sign it."

You might encourage the person who posted the video to block trolls. Interacting with them boosts their numbers and invites more of them.

I'll also summarize refutations to specific attacks on Kamala regarding immigration.
‚Ä¢    Many studies conducted over the past 150 years are quite consistent: Contrary to popular belief, both authorized and unauthorized immigrants have crime rates equal to or lower than those born in the U.S. 
‚Ä¢    Some studies focus on homicides. Immigrants, whether authorized or unauthorized, have lower homicide rates than people born in the U.S. 
‚Ä¢    In a study of all 50 states, increased unauthorized immigration over 14 years was not related to terrorist attacks, radicalization, or terrorism prosecutions. 
‚Ä¢    ‚ÄúSanctuary communities‚Äù are as safe as other communities. They are likely to decrease crime because immigrant victims are much more willing to call the police. 
‚Ä¢    Although there is no connection between crime and unauthorized immigration, the media almost always depicts immigrants as criminals. 
‚Ä¢    Despite calls to close ‚Äúopen borders,‚Äù the U.S. has not had open borders since the 1920s.  Reports indicate that the border is well fortified.
‚Ä¢    Policies during the Trump administration led to long-lasting trauma for children separated from their parents.  The Trump administration‚Äôs ‚Äúreturn to Mexico policy‚Äù forced asylum-seekers back to Mexico to await their hearings. That placed them in extreme danger. At least one in 70 people forced to return reported being victims of rape, kidnapping, assault, and other crimes in Mexico.
‚Ä¢    Policy-makers can help prevent homicides by immigrants by supporting social service and law enforcement practices that welcome immigrants. These homicides will not be prevented through deportations, further criminalizing immigrants or banning sanctuary communities. Research studies do nothing to comfort the loved ones of those brutally murdered, but they can be used to create policies that will help keep everyone safe."

If it is any consolation, I am hearing similar arguments from adults and I suspect younger voters/interested youth may be repeating what they hear at home.

On the one hand: We had the pandemic which caused global inflation and supply/consumer goods shortages, and had many schools and parents/guardians learning and working remotely.

On the other hand: Biden & Harris worked with congress to pass the American Rescue Plan (which put a little more money into our pockets), the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS and sciences act (which is bringing manufacturing back and creating more jobs). Of the G7, our economic recovery was the fastest.

From here, ask each other questions and encourage their media literacy learning (which may coincide with How to Cite Your Sources lessons in school).

Good Luck!"

I've watched many, many speeches and don't recall Kamala saying this.  It's an incredibly awkward phrase, so it would stand out. Am I missing it or is this untrue?

The quote is ""what can be unburdened by what has been"" - I don't mean to give the video more unnecessary views. I notice they don't include any video of her saying this.  If she had been repeating it, that would have been easy enough.

The claim is that this is Marxist code phrasing for the intention of wiping out (destroying)  everything that has come before in order to build a new society.

Do we do anything to combat this or do we ignore the misinformation?

I'm kind of embarrassed about this because I might show my age. 1996...Bill Clinton's re-election. And yes, I voted for him and no, I don't regret it. Now that I think about it, I voted Democrat in every single election I ever voted in."

Harris is part of an administration right now and doesn't set foreign policy. I personally believe her approach will be different than Biden's. Her words have been nuanced and she has said she supports Israel's right to defend itself. I think she is holding back for the sake of continuity and because it's her role as VP.

I include bullet points that will dismantle public education and eliminate the Dept of Education. To this end, does anyone have any recommendations in terms of volunteering more with the campaign? I prefer to avoid phone banking, yet if that's what is needed, then I'll volunteer my time. We've ONLY got 6 weeks to go, and we/I can't let up because the stakes are too high!

The Harris/Walz Campaign and Nevada Democrats seek out-of-state volunteers to make phone calls and post content online to help keep Nevada Blue. Democrats won Nevada in 2016 and 2020 by less than 3 percent. This is an opportunity to significantly contribute to electing Kamala Harris as the President of the United States.

My algorithms are feeding me all blue voters for the most part. X is filled with so many trolls in the comments of any posts from right-wing news accounts that it's hard to know where to bother engaging. Do we have any data on the value of engaging on X at all?

That said, I've had some good conversations with a couple of blue voters who were posting cynical takes. I point out the need for encouraging engagement through positivity and a spirit of unity. I've also been wearing down a couple of intelligent evangelical friends on FB who don't like Trump but have been lied to about Kamala. It's amazing how effective one can be when acknowledging people's concerns rather than judging and arguing!

Sincerely pro-life people are worried about the ""unintended consequences"" of the harsher abortion restrictions, and it's easy to change people's minds about economics if they're not completely absorbed into the cult."

There was a post going around saying that Harris used a teleprompter during the Oprah interview. I put a comment saying, ""Teleprompters are often used in video production and they're usually to keep things running smooth for the host in situations where guests are 'ad-libbing' their answers."" Seems today I found this in my notifications and the Trump supporters once again showed they were lying. PS. I only went that techinal becuase I have a degree in Communication & Journalism but I took a lot of classes in video/TV production and digtal media. Of course it wasn't anything like it is today when I was at Rider, that's for sure."

What makes this significant is a lot of women in ‚Äúred areas‚Äù of Michigan are stating their concerns on putting up yard signs in their red areas. Some have put them up just to have them stolen or defaced. Others have found other creative decorations. The idea of posting is to encourage not having fear of your convictions.

HOW BIDEN & HARRIS HAVE FOUGHT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

CALIFORNIA. As California AG, Kamala Harris went after drug gangs, human traffickers and cartels that smuggled guns, drugs, and human beings across the US-Mexico border.

CENTRAL AMERICA ROOT CUASES. In 2021, VP Harris led the effort to address root causes of illegal immigration to the US from Central America, negotiating $4B in direct assistance and over $5.2B in US private-public investment. With economic recovery 2022-23, encounters at the Southern border from all countries increased, but the share of encounters from Mexico & Central America decreased by 30% points.

BIPARTISAN BILL KILLED BY TRUMP. In Feb 2024, Trump urged Republicans to REJECT the bipartisan immigration bill that included permanent restrictions on asylum while significantly increasing border agents, asylum adjudicators and immigration judges. The bipartisan bill (supported by ~20 Rep Senators) was DEMANDED and NEGOTIATED by Republicans who tied the bill to a Ukraine aid package, but Trump killed the deal for his own political gain.

BIDEN-HARRIS ASYLUM RESTRICTIONS. Between Feb and Jun 2024, the Biden-Harris administration developed and executed a plan for DHS and DOJ to suspend the entry of most migrants crossing the US-Mexico border illegally, virtually shutting down asylum processing. The Biden-Harris plan differs from Trump‚Äôs plan by providing exemptions for humanitarian reasons such as victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.The result was ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS FELL TO A 4-YEAR LOW. More recently, Biden has secured additional funding for the most significant increase in border agents in ten years. 

COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. As President, Harris will bring back the bipartisan bill and sign it into law. And she will push for  comprehensive reform that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship."

Migrants make the tough choice to leave their homes & homeland to make the arduous & dangerous journey to the U.S. in order to escape extreme poverty, gang violence & corruption. 
She helped send more $4 billion in U.S. aid to those countries, including COVID vaccines. She obtained the involvement of over 50 companies that have invested $5.2 billion & created more than 70,000 jobs. Columbia Sportswear, Nespresso, auto-parts manufacturer Yazaki North America Inc., & others created thousands of factory & farming jobs.
Her efforts were stymied by entrenched gang violence & corruption. Nonetheless, migration from the 3 countries during the Biden-Harris administration has fallen 35 percent, to a level lower than it was in 2019 under Trump. While encouraging, it‚Äôs hard to know if her work on these long-term solutions helped produce this decline. https://wapo.st/3ABKjtI https://ampr.gs/3WNFHIt https://bit.ly/46SZmeA"

It seems like a largely untapped social media platform for us, and it's a goldmine.  It's largely already liberal, so we can focus on getting out the vote, recruiting volunteers, and getting donations.  Even better, it's easy to target people.  For example, in the Georgia subreddit we can reach out to people in Georgia and make sure they know the deadline for registering to vote is coming up.  I've already had some success getting hundreds of likes and comments on some posts, some in subreddits that are probably low engagement voters or non-voters.  Since most people are not going to like or comment, that means many times more are viewing these.

Most of the comments on Reddit today are liberal but not helpful.  We should be providing actionable information, especially in local subreddits.  Links to information about voting, registration, etc.  We should jump in when anyone makes a complaint about Trump and provide information for people to do something about it!  I'm already doing this as much as I can, but the more people we get involved, especially in local subreddits (every city has one), the better.  I can't cover all the small subreddits."

I notice I am getting more followers and engagement, but finally today, I got both a quote tweet, and a comment. Both positive . Thank you to whomever it is who diligently gets so much content in the Reach app and very timely! By the election, I might be having a relatively interactive social media experience instead of just sending things into the void. I dp have some loyal followers who retweet my tweets fairly regularly, so I like that since it gets the Harris/Walz reach content out in front of ever more viewers. Anyway, just kudos to the reach content creators!"

I also suspect that while you may have been removed from the groups, those that you have created and which meet a membership threshold will still be there.

If worse comes to worse and Meta won't restore access (even after asking nicely), you may need to create a new set of accounts and ask group members/friends to approve your rejoining."

People  need  to understand  her stance on  foreign affairs , the middle east is a hot bed for fear of 3rd WW, the economy ( she's done that) but needs to message  more in interviews,  and immigration policy  talk about  it more. I don't think  we should keep  advertising  for Trump. We don't  need people  thinking he's a Tough guy, foe some reason the US is in love with them.

And they all communicate with each other so if your account gets burned (for instance if they check mutual servers and see your main is here) then you'll lose access to all the servers you've gotten verified patriot status to that point will be for nothing.

How quickly folks who subscribe to this kind/level of rhetoric go from ""affable"" to belligerent after asking some basic questions. Those I generally dismiss because they're usually harmless; all bark, little bite when they swagger up to The Box on live pods to blast the audience with their rhetoric.

I have come across two (maybe three) since becoming more civically/politically engaged that I flagged and/or reported to the company/platform where I encountered them. It's the cold. It's the lack of emotion. It's the disregard of the social contract. There is no bar too low or bridge too far in service to whatever goal they want to achieve. They are both chaos agent and are media savvy/know how to play an audience.

I've gotten better identifying one from the other. I've been doing this online thing since 1989.

I know some of what is out there and I make the choice to be optimistic and supportive when I can. TBH: I don't always get it right and I think I'm better just holding space when folks need it.

Lends itself to online chat rooms without social anxiety and the high IQs lead to superiority complex which when we collectively ignore the needs of the american people in favor of lower taxes leads to a sense of unfairness.

Longer Answer: Progressive Social Media Influencers and Content Creators have experienced an increase in time outs and account bans this election season; these are increasing as we approach Early Voting and Election Day proper.

What we can do is keep going. By this I mean, keep on doing what we are doing; posting content from Reach, focusing our (re)posts in coordination with HQ, requesting CNs to correct mis/disinformation, and working within our spheres of influence to spread the message--and the hope and joy.

I expect the increase in account reporting to continue, so be prepared and do what you can to protect your peace."

Online our best strategy is to have authentic conversations with people in our digital communities, as well as friends and family members. One thing this post got right is that you have a greater impact to energy expended ratio talking to those who are already on the fence/undecided and making sure everyone has a plan to vote, than trying to convince hardcore Trump supporters. At the end of the day though, we know every single vote counts and that's why it's crucial that we all do what we can to fight and win this <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>  

I wouldn't recommend intentionally going into MAGA-heavy spaces to try to convince voters, because you're not going to get as much ""bang for your buck"" there. It's also harder to keep up the momentum of joy in those spaces, and we know that's a big part of why this campaign is resonating with so many -- because it focuses on joy and the future! If you're interested intentional posting and commenting on socials,  I'd reccomend reacting with the emoji to join our Reddit community here: https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1260651617867399188/1260728814540165162 !

The psychologists missed it too. Yes, JD has sociopathic traits; yes, he wants power, but that's not the whole story. He has a reason. I've met someone like him before.

JD has always been a systemic thinker. That's why he had a problem with Trump in the first place. There is a popular idea in higher education ethics that promotes calculated risks and meaningful sacrifices. This is the same thinking that drives doctors not to treat miscarrying women - because *they can save more lives by not getting arrested.* 

I think JD behaves in an inhuman way **by choice**, to serve a specific goal. I think he removes his own basic human compassion for the US population as a ""necessary evil,"" in his head, at least. He believes he is the good guy protagonist on a crusade against evil, and I think Trump was only ever a pawn to him.

I heard him say in an interview (I wish I could remember where) that he thinks the world will become more compassionate if more people have children. I think he meant it. This is his own internal narrative, and he wants others to have the same profound experience because he believes people ONLY learn true compassion when they have kids. I think his plan is to put himself in power and force as many births as possible through legislation. I think he genuinely believes that this will promote peace and security for the future of all mankind.

Is he wrong? OF COURSE HE IS. People learn compassion in early childhood, not in the moment they reproduce. That's why its so easy for him to ignore the needs of a nation to serve his good-guy-protagonist agenda. His mother couldn't give him the compassion he needed when he was young.

This is his *reason* for wanting power, his psychological Achilles' heel. The more he is confronted with the reality of childless compassion, the more it will destabilize him."

We do have a channel managed by the campaign and party and when they want us to take immediate action and/or help them capture a moment, they will push any instructions to us via the <#1250551973053468672>  channel.

While wandering around the city looking for Democrats stuff, I bumped onto someone. When I asked them for directions for the Democrats, they told me they are voting for Trump. I asked why and they told me their reasons: 1. Trump will be more effective at dealing with bad faith actors on the global stage like Iran. 2. Kamala Harris' economic policies will turn the US into Communist China and the people that will suffer the most will be the middle-class. I think hearing such things even if we have strong feelings about them is  important. Because it shows that there are other reasons people will vote for the other side or simply one reason. So, the thing to ponder here is how can we persuade people regarding points 1. and 2. as to why Harris is the better option. üôÇ"

I have been seeing similar on TikTok/on the Lives of progressive TikTok content creators for several weeks at this point.

The Good News: This can be redirected fairly quickly by asking the person to define Communism/Marxism, followed by asking them if they own their own home/property. A step further is to ask them what type of economy we have (spoiler: a mixed one.)

The Meh News: The person responding may have a negative reaction when responding so do what you can to protect your peace."

- ""Border Czar"" is not an official title of any government official; it is one coined by MSM
- DHS is in charge of the border. It's chief is Mayorkas
- The duties of a VP are defined in Articles 1 & 2 of our Constitution; President of the Senate, a tie breaking vote there, and someone to take over for the President and/or extra duties as assigned
- We have been under Title 8 (8 USC) for 60 years
- Asylum is a legal process and covered under 8 USC 1158 (spoiler: no port of entry required)
- During C19 and under the public health emergency, we were under Title 42 which restricted immigration. Once the emergency was declared over, we went back to Title 8
- Harris brokered a deal with the Northern Triangle Countries to further economic growth in that region and to stem the tide of immigration (root causes strategy)"

Did I mention it took five days for the President to mobilize the military? Just follow along with the highlighted portions below. Remember, the hurricane was October 27th.
Roughly 500 soldiers with the 20th Engineer Brigade, XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division left Fort Liberty on Oct. 3 for Asheville, the largest city in western North Carolina and part of Buncombe County, one of the most damaged parts of the country by Helene. They are conducting inspections of the roads in the region, as well as clearing debris and transporting supplies. Several aircraft were deployed with them for the mission. 
More than 500 soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division deployed to western North Carolina on Saturday, Oct. 5. They brought at least 60 Infantry Squad Vehicles, and more than 15 helicopters to the area as well, for troop transport and to move supplies. The soldiers with Task Force Falcon will be focused on a variety of roles, including search and rescue, traffic control and clearing roads of debris. The active-duty troops will also prioritize the last step of getting aid to communities, transporting it from staging areas to ‚Äúthe point of need,‚Äù according to the Department of Defense. 
Helene made landfall on Sept. 26 as a Category 4 hurricane and in the days that followed tore through the southeast, flooding communities, forcing large evacuations ‚Äî including some at military bases along the path of the storm ‚Äî and leaving a trail of destruction. 
September 26 ‚Äî Helene Makes Landfall
September 27 ‚Äî Devastation in North Carolina

October 2 ‚Äî President Biden mobilizes the military
October 3 ‚Äî Mobilization of 500 soldiers begins

My husband and I evacuated to the nearest shelter after our flight out was canceled. TPA announced  their closing on Monday. They closed at 9:00 am on Tuesday and our flight was booked for 8:55 am. By the time we learned that our flight was canceled, everything else was booked so we were stranded. No rental cars are available as many cars had been damaged by Helene and rentals were taken. The evacuation shelter is grossly overcrowded, inefficiently staffed and dirty. If we survive the storm, we will probably get sick.

I encourage <@&1266883962727432304> / Content Creator Team to connect the dots to Trump's ""very fine people"" who will undoubtedly attend.

In 1939, 20,000 Americans rallied in New York's Madison Square Garden to celebrate the rise of Nazism -- an event largely forgotten from U.S. history. A NIGHT AT THE GARDEN, made entirely from archival footage filmed that night, transports audiences to this chilling gathering and shines a light on the power of demagoguery and anti-Semitism in the United States. 

Directed by Marshall Curry

Thank you for the heads up about the rally on Oct. 27 and it appears other news outlets are reporting on it also.

I think this post and its associated media would be better placed in the <#1268690577960992878> channel.

Otherwise, how does this content uplift the policies and messages of the campaign? Does this content help support both the campaign and its volunteers?"

Although Trump's rally got a lot of empty seats, the damages of his rally speeches were still going on. He accused that Harris forced Biden to drop out of election. He accused that Harris would cause 1929 depression. These accusations would cause widespread rumors about Kamala Harris. 
When the support of black voters for Harris is lower than Biden in 2020 election, those black voters loyal to Biden may turn to Trump, if they believe the false claims of Trump's rally speech.
Therefore, please do not underestimate and ignore the damages of Trump's rally speeches."

I have a facebook banner for Harris that I copied and pasted from somewhere. The quality is just meh. If the campaign had a series of fb banners in a media kit that I can copy and paste from, especially with messaging that they want out at the moment - I'd prefer to do that.

It's normal for people to feel anxious as we get closer to the election, especially with a race that's so close. CNN isn't wrong for posting an article that shares a common feeling across America at this point in time, but I agree with you that it's not really encouraging and not really a vibe we want to perpetuate in these final days!

I will say for myself, I started getting involved in campaign work in 2020 because I was *so anxious*! And volunteering for the campaign was a way to channel that anxious energy into productivity, talking to voters and helping increase turnout! I encourage you to put any anxious energy into volunteering (we appreciate you being here! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> ) and encouraging those you encounter in real life and online to do the same -- we're all on the same team and the only thing that matters is votes. Polls can vary so wildly and aren't always accurate, so let's put our energy into people over polls and make sure we're contacting as many voters as possible! <:happysun1:1270566006590541896>"

Not sure how successful, but I think this inflation angle gets people thinking.

Where does the inflation money go?

When eggs jump in price overnight the money did not go to the chickens.  When gas jumps the oil in the ground did not change.

Inflation money goes to the rich.

Example: Trump just raised the price of Mar-a-lago membership from $200,000 to $1,000,000.  Did his cost rise 400%, no.  Did Biden get part of that inflation increase, no.  A rich guy, Trump, put it in his pocket.  Who paid?  Well other rich guys paid, but they never really pay, they raised prices!  

Trump, and his buddies, are not the solution, they are the problem.

Need more, check out Trump buddy Musk, Cyber truck, Musk said $40,000 price now it's $100,000 at cheapest that's 150%.  And Musk got a $46 billion, that's $46,000,000,0000 pay package. So why is the electronic car guy buddy buddy with President Fossil Fuel?  He doesn't want it taxed.

So, who pays for the rich trying to stay rich?  American consumers and taxpayers.

Trying to explain using those simple examples to get the truth across.

My profile here accepts DMs & on X at @BetoangelMommas

I've spent the time between campaigns as a ""sedition hunter"" y'all so that X profile might seem odd as I have to be very  anonymous as a result. If it is a concern I will gladly be more transparent via DM if that helps 

I am able to rate community notes & did offer assistance in that channel as well

I need HELP. I was minding my business and I am swarmed with magats. I have already answered over 200 comments nonstop. The thing is, answering comments regardless of what they are increases profile visibility and make Blue voters in that app feel see and supported. That app is full of magats kids rabidly parroting magat keywords or attacking other kids who understand Democracy. 

No worries, I am answering magats  like this: 
‚Äúsay Trump is you ARE VOTING for KAMALA HARRIS AND TIM WALZ USA USA USA üíôüá∫üá∏ü¶Öüíôüá∫üá∏ and attach images from the Reach app with Harris-Walz Campaing information.‚Äù

This is my personal Facebook (digital creator profile), but I also shared it to Harris for Texas (official space) where we limit Trump content deliberately. Too easy to get sucked into mocking him, commiserating etc. We need our energy for other things. However, I am pleased with the number of reactions and shares. That is rare.

The beauty of sharing content from Reach is you can also pull tag ideas from the suggested copy and/or the content category. By doing so, you can improve any SEO organically and increase the chances your post will get picked up by the platform's algorithm.

You can find suggested copy and content categories by clicking share and scrolling down the popup tab.

Lastly, I tend to use tags more often on Twitter, Instagram, Threads, Blue Sky, and TikTok vs. Facebook, but that is more about how I use that platform vs. the others.

LMK if you have further questions!"

Which is vital for developing local economies. Trump is for the Billionaires and they don't care about the rise in food prices or any daily essentials which would profit his billionaires. This leads to broken families and eventually increases homelessness in the sociaty. I told her these things and she wants to, maybe consider writing further on this, it seems by her engagements with the idea. I don't like mocking Texans because they are all Trump and Elon Musk fans.

Silver admits that Republican polls are biased, but argues they are not strongly biased. This actually fits with Rosenberg's argument - he is saying they are trying to be very incremental, so that the bias is not noticed, but there is a cumulative effect on the aggregated results. He argues they did the same thing in 2022 but on a shorter timescale (because they started later), so they had to increase the bias which made it more noticeable (and there was a large discrepancy between the predicted ""red wave"" and what actually happened that year). The other key factor (according to Silver) is whether the various modelers posting aggregated summaries are properly adjusting for bias. Silver claims they are, whereas Rosenberg thinks they are not. Silver argues that all the modelers adjust, but do so with different methods, yet come to similar conclusions. I don't have a paid subscription so I couldn't read the complete article and so cannot comment on how convincing Silver's arguments are concerning the adjustments made by the modelers."

My first career was law-adjacent. I was a discovery lead in civil/class-action lawsuits here in my home state of California. Often, this meant I was tracking down documents and/or people who didn't want to be found and once I did, ensuring that evidence/testimony/affadavits were shared with all attorneys of record.

Something I learned then that is applicable today: Follow the money. Follow the story (or metadata/digital footprints).

Fortunately, and in this case, I didn't have to dig that far. I looked into who produced the video and what any incentive might be. Unfortunately, I question its validity and its timing; this video you shared is the second in a week with a dubious provenance with the intent to cast doubt (or worse) on the character of our candidates. I am not going to link what I found because I do not want to drive traffic/eyeballs to those sites.

Your friend isn't ready. She may never be. At this point, you may consider what you want to do with this relationship and/or what is safe and reasonable for you both.

FWIW: I'm sorry."

I have been engaging in meaningful conversations about WHY I am not voting for Trump. A win is when I inform them that he wants to dissolve the department of education and because of his convoluted laws regarding the border, he has allowed more people to cross into the United States. 
I need feedback though- 
Many of my friends are Jewish and they are voting for Trump based solely on the fact they believe he will save Israel. Despite the fact that he has angers many world leaders.
What else can I tell them besides Kamala‚Äôs stance on Israel, and the fact Doug is Jewish?

While we're not in the restriction period yet, they could be using existing content as a training model for Meta AI. This could cause latency and/or throttle your content going out to your followers.

If you haven't already, save your post and redo it with one thing different--preferably less political. Then post both at roughly the same time and watch the performance. Doing so is a way to split test with the intention to rule out a shadow ban."

Then, start with acknowledging them.  ""I understand, the system sucks and we never seem to get candidates we can agree with on 100% of the issues""   

Then, break down the lie... ""The Dems don't control the House, and legislation to reinstate Roe V Wade must go through the house.""

So, instead, I found several opportunities to motivate ""already voted"" folks for volunteering.  It produced a couple of really great exchanges.  So, in the end, very worthwhile.

The big thing was to avoid vote scolding them as you're right they were kinda looking for a fight. Refusing to give it to them defused the situation.

This has been debunked. Harris was responding to hecklers and as security was escorting them out, they continued shouting but a different set of phrases.

Harris is a woman of faith and she has spoken about it throughout the campaign.

I think that you are watching a misleading youtube video. Harris was responding to pro-life protesters, not the person who yelled Jesus is Lord.
From the video of KTSM9 NEWS, you could find out that the crowds of people were very noisy, so Harris might not hear the word Jesus is Lord or Jesus is King."

Asking questions is a great method of inviting engagement. 3) Tag people to share it, either in the post or in comments.  4) Add topical hashtags to make it searchable.  5) When people like it, react and comment.  Invite them to like your content. 6) Find related content feeds, groups or pages to share it to that have a wider audience.  Be careful of any rules.  üôÇ"

It's really difficult for people to hold all of the craziest bits of the last 8+ years in their short term memory. The New York Times has some decent visualizations but usually these projects are behind their paywall.

So one of the thoughts I had was to create a site that shows conservative ""reviews"" of Trump in a visual way almost like looking at product reviews or something...I didn't have time to do that, but I did put this together which could be posted as a single layout or as social posts. Any thoughts and would anyone happen to have decent social reach for something like this? A dedicated ""Trump Job References"" social timeline would be cool, but probably difficult to build followers for an account like that account in a short time."

Good early catch! You're not the only one who uploaded their videos to YT and then realized hashtags would help an audience find the video.

There are a couple of ways to do this including having them appear next to your title or along with your video's description. This can be done as you're uploading or after the fact in YouTube Studio.

I found this video helpful:
https://youtu.be/Z4MQu3vOT0g?si=UO_NS_f6hsB66GUN

As to which hashtags to use, ask yourself what your video is about and put yourself in someone else's shoes and ask yourself what is it you're looking for. You can also search various hashtags to see what is popular and/or what fits your video's vibe.

Good luck and have fun!"
