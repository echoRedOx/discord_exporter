Content: I just signed up to get paid working as a poll worker in my state! If you're bilingual and younger (even under 16) this is a way you can participate in protecting democracy. In my state, poll workers get paid including for the training. Since I'm not an active duty military or veteran with no family ties to politicians I could apply. Each state has different restrictions however to apply was easy. I even spoke to my county clerk who provided more information. If you are diabled or do not have a car, county clerks will work with you to keep you at a closer polling location. I am more than willing to work OT for this. They will be training me and I'm planning on continuing to be a poll worker in other elections. I heard a lot of polling workers are stepping down from this they are in need of polling workers and many are older or retired. Passing this along in case anyone wants to follow suit. EDIT: MODS are trying to silence me and won't let me post anymore and tell me to share this info elsewhere. WHO ARE THESE MODS????? Do better discord and DNC and these mods are WHACK. Do not care and are unhelpful.

Content: Hi <@1272342264152068201> I encourage you to share this in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1242249109298221069 and your State channel which are much better places than this question forum.
