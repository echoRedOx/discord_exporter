Content: Hello everyone! My name is Amy. I was born and raised in south Oklahoma City. I currently live in Newcastle in McClain county. Right now, I am making phone calls for a state house campaign. I’m looking to host a voter registration drive and secure a van to drive people to the polls. 

Where is everyone from? What are some things you are doing in your communities? Is there any way we can help each other? 

I’m excited to connect with and learn from other peeps in Oklahoma!

Content: Besides working on this and  down ballot campaigns in Oklahoma, we can also do things to support the Harris/Walz ticket in battleground states. I attended a zoom for Oklahoma Democrats and was introduced to a postcard campaign. I ordered quite a bit and would be happy to share. If you want to order your own use this link: https://www.turnoutpac.org/postcards/

Content: This might be too optimistic but I believe Oklahomans have a unique opportunity to build one of the strongest Democratic coalitions in the country. Just look at what Florida did. Oklahoma is (thankfully) getting bluer and bluer every gubernatorial cycle and there’s real hope for a better future.

Content: I think optimism is needed when building coalitions! It can be hard to be hopeful when you feel like you are a single blue dot. However, as evidenced by this server, we know we aren’t alone. I agree that we have a unique opportunity to build an even stronger Democratic base. People are already doing the work. It’s really important that we keep up this energy for all our elections and community organizing efforts!

Content: I’ve been writing postcards to swing states. It has got me thinking about how we could utilize this concept in Oklahoma as well. Voter turnout here isn’t great. Perhaps we could find a way to fund postcards to Oklahoma Dems. If anyone has any experience doing this or has any thoughts, please share! I can contact my county Dem group to see if I can do it this election cycle.

Content: Good evening! 

I’m Nat, and I’m a transplant to OK, not that you’d know it as I am “a house divided” as I have attended both OSU and OU. I’ve been trying to connect with other Dems but rural areas are overlooked. Mostly because no one runs. I can’t criticize, I’m not running (for reasons) but it is disheartening.  I know we need to fight. I know we need to recruit. But to run… that’s a huge sacrifice to ask.  I will help how I can.

Content: I personally think Oklahoma is a closeted blue state or swing state. Think about it. We passed medical marijuana. We got recreational marijuana on the ballot. We have raised minimum wage on the ballot. I feel like now is the time to have Oklahomans show up in unprecedented numbers! We haven’t crack 60% voter turnout in recent history. The closest was 59.54% in 1992!

Also soonerpoll.com (not the best pollster, but the only one I could find in Oklahoma) had Trump up by 25 this time in 2020 and now only has him up by 16 and that’s amongst LIKELY voters. Imagine if we added unlikely voters into the fray what that could mean for Oklahoma?

Content: I’ve been trying to strategize. Oklahoma has a very significant non-college white population. Instead of demeaning and looking down on them, I’ve been trying to figure out how to reach them?

I really want the Harris campaign to spend money on our media market, send Tim Walz ads and talk about how the bipartisan infrastructure bill delivered in Oklahoma. I feel like that could be so beneficial for us and our democracy. I would do it myself but I’m broke lol

Content: I just wish we could encourage non-voting Gen Z and Milennials to turn out for Kamala and that the older folks could quit focusing on the drama and hate and look who will deliver for the economy based on evidence and proposed policy.

On the border, Trump bullied our Senator out of passing the border bill 😭. Like?

Content: Great book and resource, thanks for sharing. The book is called Stolen Pride: Loss, Shame and the Rise of the Right by Arlie Russell. No linking of any form of the book here since we cannot have any money or subscription links, but the audiobook will be out soon. I wanted to mention the author and title at least.  <@1183965844372459551>

We just can't share pages with donate or contribute links. So the official reminder is going to show up here, and your post will go away. I hope I have have captured enough of the message.

Content: It’s a very realistic achievement! I don’t know what the data says about voter turnout there specifically, but Trump barely won it back in 2020! So if voter registration events and get out the vote events are working hard, I definitely could see it happen!

Content: I’m doing my diligent duty in regards to proselytizing and teatimonializing to family and friends— private political outreach— and I think any sort bipartisan unity begins at the family home.

It is no small thing to dialogue, not demonize or belittle, your MAGA relatives. Remember the human being, and for any other Indian Country members here— maintain elder respect at all times. 

Reserve genuine shitslinging for online outreach w/ local strangers on your social medias of choice. Be smart, mindful, and most importantly— stay brave and confident.

When we fight, we win. <:harris_walz_blue:1274776851805372508>

Content: Also important to emphasize & highlight, and useful to include in yer personal campaignings:

no one knows who you actually vote for. Your vote is between you and the ballot paper on the table. No one else will see it, no one else is able to know what you put pen to paper. 

Vote, and remember it matters even in deep red states. It DOES matter, and you can confidently do so without fear of anyone else knowing who you ultimately choose.

Content: I just read this article about non-voters. Which type of non-voter do you think is most common in this state? 

There are so many and I feel like knowing who they are and how to activate them, could help progress be made.

Content: Difficult to properly organize rural engagement without working thru & with the First Nations governments to plot, plan, organize.

The reality of tribal politics within Oklahoma, since we have all these Nations here, makes outreach and engagement a heckuva lot more complicated than other states in the Union.
