    last time (pre-Harris announcement) there were just two. Several first-timers,
    including me. One passerby said it's her first time voting and she's very excited
    to support Harris/Walz.

  content: I just did a phone bank training with Democrats Abroad. The related software
    gives callers options to make calls so that you call people at appropriate times
    (ie not middle of the night). You can call anywhere in those allowed times. So
    you can call people in Asia, or EU, or Americas, depending on what time it is.
    It's set up to be pretty failsafe on this point. It's possible to join calls with
    another volunteer to get the hang of how the software works and what the script
    reads like.

  content: Waving hi from Berlin. Did a phone bank this afternoon from 3-5. It's pretty
    slick. Was able to reach people from 9-11 AM Eastern, mostly talked to people
    from Massachusetts. It was nice to preach to the choir. I was in Brooklyn before
    I moved here because Trump said "Go back where you came from." Before that I was
    in SF, and first voted for VP Harris as DA. Everyone knew she was going places
    so it was no surprise when she ran for AG. It'll be great for everyone to enjoy
    SF values.

  content: Hi Linda. It's because there are various branches and campaigns within
    the DNC, including state and local as well as abroad. The fundraising for these
    campaigns and branches can't "co-mingle" and there are rules about how donations
    can be allocated within these as well. We can post their non-fundrasing/donate
    link events anywhere on the server. (edited for clarity).

  content: "Great! Thank you both for checking into the details. The fundraising part\
    \ makes sense. I\u2019m more interested in spreading the word about the online\
    \ platform that they created to make it much easier for Americans abroad to submit\
    \ their request (FPCA form) to receive their ballot under the UOCAVA laws - which\
    \ require every state to provide the option of overseas voters receiving their\
    \ ballot electronically and no later than Sept 21.\nTheir Vote From Abroad .org\
    \  website makes it easy to do.\nDemocrats Aboard promotes it heavily, but put\
    \ it under a separate nonpartisan organization designation for both legal and\
    \ practical reasons - for example, I host Voter registration & Overseas Ballot\
    \ Request events at a local farmers market in Costa Rica, which I can do under\
    \ the VFA banner. They wouldn\u2019t allow foreign political action/campaigning,\
    \ but they will allow nonpartisan voter registration activities. So we publicize\
    \ heavily to our DA members and on liberal social media, to ensure a strong turnout\
    \ of Democrats coming for voter assistance but only put ip VFA signage.\nUnfortunately,\
    \ Democrats Abroad has found that another organization is also targeting overseas\
    \ voters. I\u2019ve seen their paid ads across social media so they have some\
    \ stronger funding than we have. And, the danger is that their online form submission\
    \ process doesn\u2019t actually work consistently. So voters who use their website\
    \ *think* they are getting registered to vote, but in reality Democrats Abroad\
    \ has been contacted by LEOs across the country because the forms coming from\
    \ the competitor\u2019s website are frequently rejected by the election clerks.\
    \ That is making it more essential than ever for Democrats to get word out with\
    \ the accurate information and the link to their own voter registration platform:\
    \ Vote From Abroad .org so that overseas voters are actually getting registered.\
    \ How can we promote that here?"

    which requires a US (or Canadian?) phone number to sign up. I've heard that we
    can make a US-based Google Voice number, but haven't tried that out. Is anyone
    in here doing that to join US-based phone banking?

  content: "Got my ballot and voted this morning. And convinced my spouse who was\
    \ going to sit it out to apply to get a ballot. Probably doesn't mean much in\
    \ Dan Goldman's district in NY, but it's good to send a message with sheer volume.\
    \ If you know people on the fence (my spouse is Jewish and very upset about Gaza,\
    \ and we have Lebanese friends here in Berlin who are frantically evacuating family\
    \ from a new war zone (de-escalation through escalation.), I was able to convince\
    \ to particpate by saying: \"A lot of people died for us not to have ostensible\
    \ monarchs. A lot of people want to take away my right to vote. (The save act\
    \ in the congress makes it harder for married women who changed their name to\
    \ register to vote if they didn\u2019t change their name everywhere) One party\
    \ doesn\u2019t. If you continue going about muttering under your breath about\
    \ there being no difference between the two parties for Gazans and Lebanese, which\
    \ is tiresome (the muttering not the content), I'm going to start muttering about\
    \ the long arc of the moral universe bending towards justice. (If anyone has any\
    \ good things that are helpful if you know people from Gaza and Lebanon, who would\
    \ rather US not fund indiscriminate killing of doctors, children, and journalists,\
    \ that would be nice. For instance, a former colleague of mine spent this week\
    \ getting his family to Beirut, which will probably be affected soon. He's a data\
    \ scientist working on longevity, not a terrorist. I wish my tax dollars weren't\
    \ causing the suffering of his family, and want something useful to say to him.\
    \ But I hope Harris will be better than the other guy on the topic. AND VOTED\
    \ FOR HER!!!!!) (Can't help but think this Lebanon action is an October surprise\
    \ which is so tragically inhumane.)"

    in the US. This is a special project.  However, we have so many other programs
    with no restriction, so you will have a rich bounty of options.  See reference
    for DNC Voter Protection Hotline.

    \ My brother who is a registered republican hadn\u2019t been registered to vote,\
    \ but I helped him send out a registration form in early September. He is planning\
    \ on voting for Kamala Harris and has become extremely frustrated because not\
    \ only, has he not received a ballot form, but received a letter on Friday stating\
    \ that his registration was not valid because his signature wasn\u2019t valid!\
    \  He is completely frustrated and ready to not vote at all because of all the\
    \ difficulty he\u2019s been having. He called several times and was told they\
    \ would send him something. I sent him the emergency ballot request form as well.\
    \ \n\nDoes anyone know what he can do, given the deadline is tomorrow?!"

    U.S. Consulate or Embassy wherever he is in the world. He can't vote at a Consultate
    or Embassy but he can post it to them and they might be able to assist. Other
    options are Democrats Abroad. FVAP maintains a list of links to pretty much every

  content: Normally, we suggest using https://iwillvote.com/ for voter info.  However,
    it's best to check directly with the local state/county in which someone abroad
    is registered to vote, as the deadlines are very close, and they will have the
    most up-to-date ability to answer specific questions.
