I know it’s unlikely we’ll encounter that again on a Michigan list and of course I expressed my sympathy but she felt like she wasn’t being seen by the Biden-Harris admin, she said she hates Trump and DeSantis but that the latter had been there and Harris hadn’t. Normally I would not try to persuade in this case but she was basically asking me to, and I told her I really didn’t have much info on this and was wondering if there’s a good place to find info about this issue."
