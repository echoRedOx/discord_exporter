They did not receive a confirmation email, and when they try to access the zoom link I provided, zoom keeps asking for an access code even though they are logged in to their zoom account, which has worked in the past.  I asked them to log in and out of zoom and that did not help.  What should they do?  How can I help?"

The caller has been so helpful in troubleshooting.  Other mods say you have to be logged in to your zoom account -- is this something we prefer but is not required?

If it's a personal zoom account then logging in is fine. If it's a work account it could be asking to verify a zoom request from outside of the work  community.
