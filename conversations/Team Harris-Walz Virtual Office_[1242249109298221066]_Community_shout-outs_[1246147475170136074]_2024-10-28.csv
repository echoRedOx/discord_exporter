My name is Rep. Heath Howard and I am running for re-election to the New Hampshire State House. This is one of the closest districts in the whole state and is crucial to winning a Democratic majority come November. I am a disability rights advocate and one of the youngest legislators in America.
I'm running against the potential Republican Speaker of the House, backed by the radical Republican House leader, and I need your help to prevent him from even getting a seat.

I want to celebrate TWO volunteers since I missed my appreciation post yesterday. 

1) Thanks to <@568257600228032512> - if you had issues verifying your account and completing the extra security measures, odds are you interacted with Carolyn this week. She has been patiently and diligently ensuring we can all stay in this amazing community and continue calling, texting, posting, and connecting. 

2) Thanks to <@1266164208928686110> who has been a meme making machine this week, providing us all with countless uplifting memes to enjoy, share, and use to keep each other going. 

You are all amazing! So glad I get to be on this journey with so many brilliant, generous humans. Thanks everyone!

Who have you noticed going all out for Kamala lately?"

I went through the 3400+ contacts in my phone, winnowed down to about 60 people I felt like messaging/are in battleground states, and matched about half of them with records in the app. 

I haven‚Äôt really gone through my contacts since I started collecting them in the nineties. GOTV aside it was nice to see the lists collected there somehow by LinkedIn and Facebook and to think about all my friends, family, and colleagues. I even have Ai-Jen Poo in there from when I worked on resist stuff at meetup. She probably doesn‚Äôt need my help. Now it does seem like iCloud has gone crazy and there are duplicate sometimes quintuplicates. 

But I think some of the work of showing a different path forward is just reaching out and connecting with the people in our lives with love and hope. So that the fear the other side is trying to activate can‚Äôt take hold. 

Anyway, thanks again for another great training. It‚Äôs going to take me a while to get all the messages out but it‚Äôs really rewarding. I‚Äôve already reconnected with a friend who moved to Kentucky, and texted my cousin in CA way too early. üôÇ"
