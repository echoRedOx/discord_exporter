  content: "Hi all, I\u2018d like to see the Call Her Daddy episode full video. I\
    \ can finde video snippets everywhere, and the audio podcast. But not video. \n\
    \nOmg. \u201CSome of us are not aspiring to be humble.\u201D Best line evar. \n\
    \nI am so conflicted because I think Harris is the best candidate in modern times\
    \ who represents my POV and then I read news about Blinken approving bombs on\
    \ humanitarian aid (both paid for by our tax dollars). \n\nJust going to trust\
    \ the process for now."

  content: I found a weird youtube that has the whole video, but they have replaced
    the background with weird graphics, and I wouldn't want to send it around. Do
    you want the link?

  content: "Thanks for the reminder to watch it. It was a great interview with some\
    \ hard questions. My favorite quote from Kamala: \u201CSome people think the measure\
    \ of the strength of a leader is based on who they beat down, but the true measure\
    \ of the strength of a leader is based on who they lift up.\u201D KAMALA FOR THE\
    \ WIN!!!"
