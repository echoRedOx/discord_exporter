  content: Hello! We are opening an volunteer office in support of Kamala Harris in
    San Diego.   While our primary goals are phonebanking, postcard righting and caravaning
    to swing states, local volunteers also would like to print fliers/leafelets to
    distribute locally to their friends and family.  Are there any fliers/leafelets/etc
    online, that the Kamala Harris for president campaign has created, that can be
    downloaded and printed?
