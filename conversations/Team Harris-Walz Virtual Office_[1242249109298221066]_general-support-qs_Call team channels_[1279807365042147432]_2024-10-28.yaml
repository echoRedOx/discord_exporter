  content: Hi. I have been a member of the call team for a number of weeks and have
    been making calls successfully. I did my shadow call shift and submitted my debrief
    form. I do not have access to any of the call team channels including the resource
    channel, the question channel and the main channel where announcements are made.
    I plan to continue making calls and would like to have access to these helpful
    resources. I am committed to being part of the call team and am respectful of
    all guidelines. If I have used a channel incorrectly, please let me know and I
    will abide by all additional information I receive. I am doing my best to be a
    good member of the call team and am unaware of any reason I should not have access
    to these channels, but if I have misunderstood how they are used please inform
    me and I will comply with any additional information you provide me with in response
    to this post. I reviewed a lot of information about how to use discord, the virtual
    office and its many channels and may have misinterpreted some of the information.

  content: Hi Amy! I've tagged all call mods here so hopefully someone can help you
    with this. Also, be sure you click on "Team Harris-Walz Virtual Server" in top
    left sidebar and make sure "Show all Channels" is selected. Sometimes discord
    likes to glitch and turn that off even after we've selected it, so check first
    anytime channels disappear/aren't showing up for you!
