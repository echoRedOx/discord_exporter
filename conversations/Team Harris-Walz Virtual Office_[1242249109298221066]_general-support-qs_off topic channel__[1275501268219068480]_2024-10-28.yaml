  content: 'Would it be possible to set up an off topic, random, water cooler channel,
    whatever you want to call it, for conversation that is unrelated to the campaign?
    The <#1242249109298221069> channel has a lot of off topic chat (which is great
    that volunteers are connecting with each other) and it''s overwhelming for me.
    I still want to see the campaign related messages in there.


    Edit: also I think the name,"general conversation" maybe suggests it''s supposed
    to be for any kind of conversation, but the channel description implies it''s
    campaign related.'

  content: Hi <@756314488113987654> I appreciate the overwhelm. I encourage you to
    use the "mute channel" or "mark as read" options to turn down the "volume". You
    can just keep up with the campaign from the announcements channel and your text
    team channels. Let me know if you need help finding the mute optoin.

  content: We will be further discussing the idea later <@756314488113987654> . We
    have not come to a conclusion yet, but we agree general should remain campaign
    based
