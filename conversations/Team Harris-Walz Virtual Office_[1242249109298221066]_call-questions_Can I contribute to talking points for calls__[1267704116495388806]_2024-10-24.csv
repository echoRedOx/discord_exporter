It would be helpful to have a compilation of issues to take about and evidence to bring up. For example project 2025 came up with a PA Trump voter I spoke to on Sunday and I brought up that while Trump has tried to distance himself from the plan former Trump staffers contributed to the plan and JD Vance wrote the foreword for it but I forgot that Trump has praised the Heritage foundation in the past. And I was unclear myself on many details of the plan. 
I would find a list of issues and key points super helpful and Iâ€™d love to contribute if thereâ€™s anything interest in that."

I think there are also some good overviews of P25 talking points online and there are some graphics in <#1250876565366243348> that may be helpful to review as well. 

P25 was quite literally designed by mostly Trump cabinet and staff people. Stephen Miller is also a huge part of it and he's like Gargamel from the Smurfs. Very anti-human and immigration/asylum. And very extreme. The history of The Heritage Foundation and so many scholarly ""conservative think thanks"" goes back even further than Trump. 

There's been this movement since Scopes Monkey Trial and creationism being relabeled as ""intelligent design"" and they all have a ""dear leader"" in Trump. They are behind the huge push to eradicate true history and science from the education department."

Yes, Ophelia is correct that we are in process of getting talking points for you when making calls, and that we do have some already in the dialer sidebar. We will be sure to let you all know when we have more talking points on various issues available for you to use when on calls!"

If you click on an issue, it will show you what the plan says about the issue and what page it is on. For example, I clicked drug prices, and on page 465, it says that the plan is to repeal the Inflation Reduction Actâ€™s drug price negotiation program in Medicare along with reduce the government share in the catastrophic tier of Medicare Part D and require manufacturers to bear a larger share. It will also directly link you to the page it is on so you can read the page and come to your own conclusions.
