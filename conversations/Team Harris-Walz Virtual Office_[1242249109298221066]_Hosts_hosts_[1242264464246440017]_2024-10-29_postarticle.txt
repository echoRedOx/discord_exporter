Content: Great.  I want to use the Mobilize platform to host virtual community events, but need appropriate permissions from Administrators.  I currently am only empowered on the platform to host phone banks. Can you assist me in gaining greater Mobilize capability?

Content: Hi, I am one of the organizers of Dads for Kamala and we are planning both in person phone banks and virtual phone banks. Would love to fold into the campaign infrastructure if someone could help with this?

We also have a number of house parties that are meant to drive commitments and donations. We built a toolkit for this, but would be great to align with any tools the campaign already has. Thanks!

Content: Hey, Jason R Totten from Dads for Kamala here. I was asked if we have a map of campaign offices on the website. I didn’t see any but wanted to ask here. We’re from all over but a group within driving range of PA are planning to go and campaign there and we’re wondering where we can hook up other dads in other swing states where they can be more effective without duplicating efforts.

We have to be very careful about staying in compliance with campagin finance laws. Thanks for understanding! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Content: I'm so sorry, unfortunately - due to campaign finance laws - we can't mention any kind of fundraising for any groups (that aren't the three DNC official ones, even if they raise funds for those groups). You can say group name, just don't encourage donations/fundraising. You can resend your message after I remove it for compliance with the law, just remove the money parts. Thank you for helping us stay compliant.

Content: You can share the event links in <#1268426751164551199> and you can say the name in here or anywhere on server. Just can't mention donations or fundraising for them. That's where the line is.

Content: I did that and said where the money was going. I "get called out" for mentioning it in other channels. Whatevs, Ophelia, this is difficult to navigate. It doesn't make sense why we can't say that we are donating to the campaign. How is that against campaign finance law?

Content: You can't mention other orgs that you're donating to (or fundraisers you are hosting). You can say you're donating to an official DNC campaign of course! Let me get the staff language, that may help clarify.

We can only fundraise on behalf of: Democratic National Committee, Harris Victory Fund or Harris for President directly. 
We can recruit for "non-official events" that are hosted by partner organizations or volunteers in ⁠non-official-events-only. We can recruit into anything that is listed on events.democrats.org or a state democratic party's mobilize.
Rule 3 Note > Relevance: Do not post links to petitions or other calls to action that haven’t been approved by Staff. This forum is not intended for debates. Additionally, do not attempt to raise funds or share fundraising links for any entity besides the Democratic National Committee. Using this server to raise funds for yourself, another candidate, or another organization violates campaign finance law and is strictly prohibited.

Content: I find when sending people to other states (I go to NH with groups), we identify a location that makes the most sense on Mobilize, I book myself and when the information comes through re: confirmation (there is always an email for a contact) I email them back immediately and let them know I'm bringing a group, and if there is a better time/location, let me know. This works well, rather than hunting down contact information.

Content: good morning everyone  i don't know who to ask  so ill put it here.    what i am seeing on social media platforms and when talking to  Maga republicans that are on the fence and undecided voters in real time  they want to know why  the website doesn't show Our Policies.  to them  it makes it look like we are hiding something.   Their issue is that some of them don't have social media or no longer trust post on social media  do to misinformation  to view what we are posting.    SO ...  is there an ear we can bend top encourage them to put OUR policies on the website.?

Content: I coulnd't agree more.  I need written policies, for example the recent announcement on how much to tax the rich (less the Biden) and incentives for entrepreneurs was important to learn -- though not happy about the former.  If something exists, I'm not sure where it is.  Thank you.

Content: If you're looking for a cocktail to sip while watching the debate on Tuesday, I recommend my Alameda Lotus:

1 ½ oz St. George[1] Botanivore gin
¾ oz crème de violette or liqueur de violette
½ oz Ferrand dry Curaçao
1 oz Meyer lemon[2] juice, freshly squeezed (about the juice of 1 lemon)
(optional: a splash of elderflower liqueur)

Shake with ice. Strain into a chilled coupe.

Garnish with a thin slice of lotus root tossed in baker’s sugar. (The sugar keeps the lotus root from oxidation.)

[1] St. George Spirits is an artisanal distillery in Alameda county, California (the county where Kamala Harris was born & raised).

[2] Meyer lemons (which grow better than many other citrus trees in the fog-prone San Francisco Bay Area) tend to be sweeter and less acidic than regular lemons. If using a regular lemon, consider reducing the amount of juice.

Content: <@1276367808778862624> Team Harris-Walz: Dorthea, are you free during the presidential debate on Sept. 10? 

With just a few more weeks until the election, it’s going to take every member of this team showing up and doing the work -- wherever and whenever they can -- to make sure that we defeat Donald Trump and elect Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz in November.

If you’re ready to rally around Vice President Harris, attend a watch party near you to join supporters watching Vice President Harris debate Donald Trump and learn more about getting involved with our campaign.

Find a watch party here: https://m.kamalaharris.com/v5AeSwi0

DVRW is all about amplifying voices, raising awareness, and making sure our democracy is inclusive of every single voice. Your /their vote is y/our power—let’s make it count! 
Do a google for AAPD / voter-info
aapd  /voter-info/
They are using mobilize.us service too, have campaign supports and voter registration efforts.

❓ What do YOU need to do? Check to see if you have a phone number on your account. Phone numbers have to be mobile numbers. Landline and VOIP won't work. If you have not, set up and **verify your phone number**. For more information on how to check or verify your phone number on your Discord account, use this [support guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20you%20can%20also%20verify,beside%20the%20Phone%20Number%20section!) and scroll down to “Verify Your Phone Number”.

🛑 If your phone number is not verified by **Sept. 16th**, you will not be able to send messages or interact in the server until verified.

🔐 To achieve the best security within this Discord server, our admins will be enabling the strictest verification level available to us. This change will occur on **Monday, September 16**. By increasing our security, we will be able to verify all current server members, AND protect against bad actors infiltrating our community during the final stretch of this campaign! 

✅ Your phone number will not be shared with the campaign, or anyone on our server. Only Discord will have this information. For more on this, please see [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy). 

🤎 If you have any questions or trouble, please ask a moderator. Thank you for helping us to create the safest, and best, volunteer community!

Content: Am I being a worrywart? I subscribe to Native news online because I am half Native American. The disrespect shown the Native community by Tim Sheehy in Montana hasn't even been addressed by the Harris/Walz campaign. And that senate seat is crucial to keeping the democratic senate. Harris and Walz need to (even briefly) appear on that reservation and the campaign needs to see that the Native vote is not being taken for granted or we'll lose the senate and be hamstrung by republicans. Again. How do I get the attention of someone who can get this message to the Campaign managers?

Content: I could be wrong but I feel like that’s more of a job for Tester himself since Harris visibly campaigning for Tester could help Sheehy tie Tester to Harris, who is going to lose Montana by double digits

Content: A new text campaign was announced at 4:16 pm.  I got right on and clicked on the link at 4:16 pm.  It took me to spoke, but the"send first replies" buttons were already grayed out.  How could they all possibly be gone within a minute?!  Is there something I am doing wrong?

Content: <@1283907649876000849> sometimes they go that quickly, but if you wait a bit and keep an eye on it, the replies button will activate because someone has released their texts and people are still replying. However, if you're experiencing this a lot and are worried you might need help, you should ask in <#1259238714157305936> or <#1267941954243526756> and a texting lead or mod can help you out.

Content: <@1278397446246109265> There is a small group of people here in Florida that not only are trying to eliminate mail-in ballots, but they want to eliminate early voting and require that all voters own property in Florida. They have been agitating for years. I tangled with one of these people at a festival a few months ago. They are extremely vocal, but few people in power listen to them. While the group stopped short of instituting a poll tax, the one member I met felt strongly that a poll tax was necessary to maintain the integrity of the vote. Keep in mind that more Republicans than Democrats use mail-in voting in Florida.

Content: Texas has removed a million people from their rolls. Oklahoma has removed hundreds of thousands. We really need a messaging campaign that tells people to check their registration status NOW & a link to a site that will guide them to fix any problems. This is a serious issue that I think we can address and I know we must.

Content: Hi <@1190850265981657178> - As far as merch and donation go, we can only direct folks to https://store.kamalaharris.com/ and donations to https://secure.actblue.com/donate/web-hfp-september-2024.  It is critical to maintain the integrity of sending the funds directly to the campaign. However, if during a watch party, you want to challenge people to donate $1 or $5 every time a word or phrase is uttered or something silly happens, that might be a good idea. I hope that helps. I am sure you have some good ideas.  Thanks for your patience.

Content: Yes!  Groups like I will vote.com and vote411.com and vote.gov have all of the links to the state resources.  But not enough people know to check.  

This campaign is not focused on that, but I wonder if GOTV efforts are calling purged voters?

Content: Going to college students may help because so many of us switch apartments or switch from a dorm to an apartment and can be registered at either our home county or the one our college is in. Plus for many college students this will be the first election they vote in

Content: Hi <@1273803067581530246> - wow, what a great sign-up!! It is very helpful to ask watch-party-goers to grab that energy and volunteer to make an impact for the campaign!

Here are some examples of ways to get people involved - with some helpful quotes to get them motivated! I hope these help!:

“I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept.”- Angela Davis. We know you’re ready to change the things you cannot accept. **Phone Bank with Team Harris-Walz** ( https://events.democrats.org/event/664004/ ) 

“You may never know what results come from your action. But if you do nothing, there will be no result.”- Mahatma Gandhi. We need you and all the results you will bring to the table each and every day! **Volunteer Welcome** ( https://events.democrats.org/event/671638/ )

“Every moment is an organizing opportunity, every person a potential activist, every minute a chance to change the world.”- Dolores Huerta. **Organizing Your Friends and Family**( https://events.democrats.org/event/597621/ )

"Raise your word, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder". - Rumi. Harness the power of intentional messaging and let it rain after our Share Key Messaging training. **How to Share Key Messaging** ( https://events.democrats.org/event/597614/ )

Content: Hi, I need a Harris/Walz list for a postcard party I'm hosting this Saturday. I  ordered 100 postcards from thecivicscenter.org and stamps for a postcard party that I'd planned to host on Sept.28.  I got sent a list that was aimed at encouraging new voters in Pennsylvania to register by Oct.20.  However, I didn't realize it would be a non-partisan list.  I only want my efforts to benefit the Harris campaign.  What is the best way to get a list of addresses aimed at reaching Harris voters?

Content: I’m not sure who to tag, maybe a <@&1245831457818279986>? I live in Utah and a friend was just asking about how to get more boots on the ground in southern Utah and what resources are available to educate the people there on the Democratic platform? Are there events and volunteers available in the area, especially around Cedar City? Just need to know where to go to find the best answers. Thanks so much!

Content: Hi, <@347053610317774849>! Good for you for getting involved this way. 😄 I’ve referred your question to where someone will see it and be able to get back to you. I know it's possible to get QR codes for websites (so presumably that will include the event link for your Mobilize event), but whether Mobilize has anything automated to make it easy I couldn't say... Do they have any kind of tech support or contacts you could ping about this?

Content: Hi <@347053610317774849> ... I have been using either Bit.ly or Canva to create QR codes (both free resources). I actually just used Canva to create flyers that fit 4/(8.5x11) page, then asked a local print shop to cut after printing!

Alternatively (bc printing gets expensive!) I've seen groups print only a few color flyers, which they put in reusable holders and swap out if/when needed.

Hope that helps, good luck with your event!

Content: Thanks, I was hoping not to have to produce the flyer myself as I already have too much to do today.  I attended Camp Kamala on Saturday where they asked us to host watch parties, so I had very little turnaround time. It would be a nice feature in the future.

Content: I had received a text a couple days ago about volunteering by hosting a debate watchparty (in person or virtual options), and when I quickly glanced over the description on Mobilize, I definitely remember reading somewhere it said something to the effect of “once complete, you will be sent a swag pack”. I contemplated over the last couple days and when I went to sign up now, I can’t seem to find where it said that? Does anyone know where?

Content: I definitely understand - that was me, printing last minute before a rally last week! 😅 😵‍💫

(If you end up having time, I'd recommend creating something from a Canva template that you can have on your phone or text out as a convenient workaround.)

Either way, thanks for hosting! 🎉

Content: Hello! Thank you so much for being a host! Swag kits are sent out of the host signs up early enough to receive the kit before the event. Since the debate was tonight there wouldn’t have been enough time and the sign up link info was probably changed. Our next host event will be for Kamala’s birthday later this month! I don’t know if there will be swag kits, but sign up early and you should get one if so. (You get an email after signing up to host and that has info on how to sign up for swag)

Content: Okay that makes sense as to why the event description changed a couple days later (as it got closer to the event) and then didn’t say anything about the swag. I’ll definitely keep my eyes peeled for that!! Thank you so much!!

Content: <@1229666062988218388> - I think this just means that you need to make sure you are logged into your Zoom account before clicking to join. That is what I heard.  Checking now.  Sorry for the delayed reply. Hope you figured it out.

Content: Here is the Zoom Support link and the screenshot of the relevant portion.  Please ignore the phrase commercial account, as it has nothing to do with upgrading or paying money to Zoom. Signing into the free basic account you already have will fix the issue. https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0068339

Content: Hello, <@1274514859261825095>! Thank you so much for hosting an event! If you'd like to do postcards at your event, you will need to connect with an outside source as the campaign does not do them. Would you consider hosting your phone bank instead of postcards? Phone banking is the single most impactful thing you can do outside of a battleground state! We have lots of help and training available for phone bank hosts, too! Here's some more info:

Content: Hi Michael, I would post your question in <#1270924834163134564> (KC general).  I do not think you are added yet. so I will screenshot and post it for you.  They have the info for the shadow shifts for both chat and data captains. Welcome, I am data captain for zoom phone banks.  Also, please check your email.  There should be info there as well.

Content: Hi, <@1294011507046350888> ! Thank you for hosting a phone bank! These are such high impact events! Are you working with Sandy on your phone bank? I see Sandy posting about your phone bank, too, and want to know if they are the same or different. 

150 sign ups is fantastic! To help get as many of them to the actual event, it's a great idea to reach out to them and confirm their attendance. What do you think about working on that?

Content: Not sure if I'm in the right place for this, but I have an idea for a phonebanking event for MT's Senate seat Jon Tester. Montanans are passionate about our two college football teams, MT Griz and MT State Bobcats ("Cats"). Often if a home has both Griz & Cat fans in it, it's referred to as "A House Divided." So it might be fun to bring Griz & Cats fans together for "A House Divided, United for Tester" virtual phonebank. Thoughts?

Content: <@465305140786888705> - The hosts space is for and also pb hosts / host support channels will help. So as far as leading your own event, this channel group is the place to be.  Once you get your event link set up, then you can post it to Montana channel and other platforms.  You would also post in Montana about any local or state wide races. 🙂

Content: Hey y'all, if you know, are we doing all volunteer recruitment calls tonight? Or are we going to switch to voter contact at some point?
That shift has been challenging for callers, but we'll make it work if that's what's happening.

Content: I will say, almost all of the volunteers loved making recruitment calls. A couple were upset that we weren't calling swing-state voters, but 2 out of 150 is not bad.

Content: Joe from Indianapolis here, greetings to everyone!  I am a federal GS employee.  Would I be violating the Hatch Act or any other laws/rules if I volunteered for the Harris campaign?  I would obviously be doing this on my personal time.  Please advise my best course of action.  Thank you!

Content: Hi Joe, you would not be violating any federal rules by volunteering. We could use another person on our phone banks. Let’s get you started with phonebanking today. Which [**Phone Bank with Team Harris-Walz**](https://events.democrats.org/event/664004/?utm_source=Discord&utm_medium=Posts&utm_campaign=Daily%20Engagement) shift looks best to you?

Content: We've had a few comments from phone bankers that they reached potential volunteer recruits, who said they had been contacted before, agreed to volunteer, and didn't get a text. This was probably 6 or 7 reports, not a huge amount, but I told folks we would pass it on to the campaign.

Content: Hi all!  I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this question, if not, please let me know!  I am hosting an independent phonebank, and wanted to post on facebook about it to get people to sign up.  However, everytime I post it, it seems like the algorithm is not picking it up.  I tried just using a picture and putting the link in the comments, not mentioning Harris/Walz by name in the post, etc.  but it still seems like it's not getting much traffic.  Any suggestions?

Content: Hi, I am new here. I am a volunteer with Democrats Abroad, and we are on pause until they find new groups of people for us to call.  Suggested we go here, but there is some problem with having a non-US phone number. I cannot get into all the rooms. Is there a tech person who can help?

Content: Also, I have been making campaign videos for the Women's Caucus, they are very busy now so many of the videos are going unused.  Does anyone want to look at the videos as see if they can be helpful.  Most of them are aimed at disinformation, such as "How does a Trump-Spin work".  Also video on Project 2025 which could get more traction if spread.

Content: Hi Kristin! I'm not sure on current Facebook algorhithm but generally, it's more than just a single post. User consistency, engagement history, etc. all play a factor. Sorry that doesn't help very much for this campaign. Maybe someone else might see this and add more?

Content: DNC staff is aware of this issue and looking into it. It's possibly best to use a VPBn as a workaround but we know that's not ideal for everyone so we're seeing if there's anything else we can do to help gain access. We want you to help. Thank you for your patience and commitment to volunteering!

Content: If you're interested in making videos, you might consider applying for Content Brigade. Most of the work is by assignment based on what the campaign needs in the moment, but they also take ideas from team members and assess for relevance and campaign messaging alignment. Your ideas and videos could be one they like so worth a shot if you're also willing to work on their project requests: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGagDymRvLijLndUOl1PtjkwZKbbMv_WHUkFgCfRC4E51JFA/viewform

Content: Hey folks! Let me know if I should post this elsewhere, but this channel is my best guess. My wife (good planner) and I (good at tech) are in Santa Barbara, CA, and are considering organizing an Oct26 carpool/bus from SB to Las Vegas to knock on doors. E.g. https://events.democrats.org/c/surge_carpools-for-kamala-to-nv/event/create/  The closest buses leave from LA, and we think there's a busload from SB that we might be able to organize. Who can I DM or talk to about how this works? Need a lot of info fast to decide if this is feasible.

Content: Hi Shep! You could ask in the California channel <#1268356016240857088> to ascertain interest and possibly get help from others who have hosted one. Mobilize lets you post your event to get signups and it's up to you to organize it.

I am a high school student and very dedicated to getting Kamala into office, so I am making calls for the campaign and was hoping I could get community service hours for school as well. Is there an email I can send a link to or someone to ask for approval for my hours calling voters today? Thanks!

Content: Hi. I'm deleting this post because we never share voters' information publicly. Please do not collect voter contact info as we have no apparatus for individual call backs.

Content: I’ve been making calls for the campaign since September.  However this week I’m on vacation and haven’t been making calls. My typical slot is 4:00P EST.  How are calls going this week? Are we still calling volunteers or has the campaign shifted to swing states? Looking forward to jumping back in on Monday.

Content: Hi Yvette! Enjoy that vacay! We are making over 2m calls a day on the daily this week. It is 🔥 . 
We are still doing some volunteer outreach, but it is mostly voter contact and persuasion (and rally confirms, ofc). Can't wait to have you back and calling!

Content: Hello- I’m using the dialer from my event the other day. I need to escalate an issue that a voter told me about. She told me that numerous people from her friends and family have gone to one Montgomery Place in Montgomery Pennsylvania and were told that early voting is only available on October 28 and 29th when in fact those are the last days you can vote early they are preventing people from voting and spreading misinformation.

Inviting me to an Obama/Springsteen rally tomorrow, 10/28 in Philly. I clicked on the link I was emailed and completed the registration on 10/24, but haven’t heard anything since. We are about 24 hours out and starting to worry we may not be granted admission? Any insight would be appreciated, thank you!

Depending upon which state they are in, they can contact their local elections office and ask. They can also ask if there are pick up/drop off locations near to them, too.
