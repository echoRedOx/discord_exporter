Content: Hi Hoosiers for Harris!! Super excited to be here with you. I've started arranging Carpools to the poles, and Absentee ballot retrieval assistance. It's important to me because one of our legislators filed a petition to terminate free bus rides on pole day. Such a marginalizing move! I've started contacting our congresswomen/men requesting they vote NO on this. Pls feel free to do the same! I'll post the story here in a sec. LET'S GO HOOSIERs for HARRIS!!üá∫üá≤‚öñÔ∏èü•≥

Content: I've been thinking about making a Facebook group to try and co-ordinate Hoosiers For Harris, would anyone else be interested in that? I figure a Facebook group might get more new folks involved than just this server, as Discord tends to be more of a niche thing

Content: I know it's unlikely Indiana will go blue, but I'd love to see us get a little more purple this year. I really think most Hoosiers are kind, decent people, and Harris is the obvious choice for kindness and decency, we just need to spread the word and get people aboard the Harris hype train!

Content: I would be interested in joining! I'm in a group called Nasty Women of Indiana, which is made up of democrats who happen to also be women. I got an email from Harris/Walz campaign with the donor map, Central/Southern Indiana is showing their love through donations!

Content: I want to try online volunteering, but I'm more comfortable in-person than making phone calls. I know several other people who would be happy to join any local volunteer efforts as well, so I'd love to find/work with people to organize some local IRL support for Harris

Content: I found when I looked into it that it's much more ideal when you have two devices, that's my obstacle. I have a computer put away, I need to get it set up again so I can participate in phone banking. I plan on attending a training session on online engagement either tomorrow or Wednesday! There are many outlets for volunteering, and all of them are wonderful ways to spend your time üíô

Content: Hi there, so me & my boss, we are trying to set up a voter registration drive at our neighborhood @ Irvington, Indianapolis (Eastside indy) hopefully on Sept. 21. We have  neighborhood businesses onboard with the idea. Only thing is this is our first time doing it, and I am hoping for any help/directions possible. Appreciate the help there. üôèüèª

Content: Indiana! I want to know when you start spotting Harris/Walz signs in your neck of the woods.

With the lead emerging nationally‚Ä¶ is it okay to still dream of flipping this state blue again? Can you imagine how wonderful it would be?

Content: Hey, <@1273774967678570580> Thanks for your leadership in this Hoosiers group. (I'm new to Discord, so I don't know whether we're in a "group", "channel", or something else.) You asked for suggestions for our Rules; I'd like to suggest that we consider using our nine Text Team Rules either verbatim or as a guideline. I'd be happy to share them with you, if you'd like. Again, thanks for your initiative, energy, and dedication.

Content: I would love to turn Indiana blue, but would be happy with being purple.  

Is there any local campaign contact to get a Harris-Walz yard sign?  The volunteer training I went through last week seemed to only care about focusing on the battleground states; which makes me sad, though I understand the mathematical reasoning.

Content: I'm not sure about a local campaign contact, but I know you can get one online! I agree that it's sad they're only focusing on battleground states, but maybe if we work hard enough in swing states they'll have time/money to spare, and if we work hard enough locally maybe they'll think Indy is worth fighting for too <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Content: As text team members, we will:

1. Show kindness and respect to staff, fellow volunteers, supporters, and every person you message. We are committed to creating a safe and welcoming experience for every member of our community. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

2. Assume best intentions, keeping in mind that digital communication erases gesture, voice, and other helpful forms of context. Remember, we can't know what people are going through. Avoid responding in the heat of the moment.

3. Acknowledge the time and experiences shared with us by everyone we meet, no matter their political views. Our texts may be the only interaction a voter has with the campaign. Thank them for taking the time to talk to us and let them know we appreciate hearing their input.

4. Represent the Democratic Party positively, honestly, and accurately. We never support a negative premise, make endorsements or value judgments, draw on unapproved source material, put words in a candidate or elected official's mouth, soften or change policy to appease a voter, or engage in arguments.

5. Respect each other's privacy. Absolutely no: sharing screenshots outside of our workspace or exposing personal details about voters. Do not share personal information without express consent.

6. Follow through on commitments to the responsibilities we take on with this team, and communicate if we need to step back or if something comes up.

7. Before deciding to send a batch of texts, be sure you can send all the initial messages you claim within thirty minutes of doing so and are available to handle your replies for at least an hour. Be mindful of your availability before making that commitment. If something changes, let a moderator know.

8. Sending messages is just the beginning with texting - it's important to make sure the voters who choose to reply to us are receiving prompt, thoughtful responses. Each night, we ask you release all your texts at the end of your shift.

Content: Hi Laura, I am so sorry I have been out sick past couple of days, just got back and catching up here with the messages. Our planning is going well. Only grievance I have is we were suppose to have the guys from IndyVote out there helping us register, but I guess we will have to do it on our ownselves since from what I understand, apparently the national GOP was asking to stop the voter registration drives. Craziest stuff ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Content: We are fighting voter suppression at Purdue‚Äôs main campus. 50,000 students and 20,000 staff affected. After public pressure they are adding early voting but not election day voting. That is a lot of young voters being disenfranchised. The campus usually votes 70 percent democratic.

League of Women Voters, Jennifer McCormick and Valerie McCray weighing in. Make your voices heard. Voter suppression affects the entire state and country.

Content: ACTION NEEDED! Purdue Update: The Lafayette team is crunching the numbers. They had 7268 voters at the campus polling places in 2008. The current early voting plan is 4 hours of early voting with 15 machines which only serves about 900 voters. AND NO ELECTION DAY VOTING!

They have had on campus election day voting for EVERY election since 2007 including the May primary. Suddenly the three person election board has deemed these same locations problematic. 

Purdue‚Äôs campus is nearly 2500 acres. Most residence halls are on the west side. The proposed off campus location is east of campus - a 30 minute walk from most of the dorms. Freshman are not allowed cars on campus. And November weather is very unpredictable. Plus, they still have classes that day.

These 6000 plus disenfranchised young voters are worth fighting for. These votes affect ALL of our state and ALL of our country. Send emails BEFORE the Sept 27 meeting.

Content: URGENT ACTION ITEM - LETTERS NEEDED

We are facing an October 7 deadline! Purdue University requested an election day on-campus voting location. The part time election board employee overlooked the email. The request wasn‚Äôt brought to light until AFTER the meeting was adjourned. We have been waiting for Purdue to appeal this decision based on Failed Transmission. But they have remained silent. As of today, the current plan of a single early voting day is going to leave many of the 6000 plus voters with a mile WALK to and from campus on a day when the students and staff are in classes. 

Please send emails to:

electionboard@tippecanoe.in.gov
president@purdue.edu
Trustees@purdue.edu
senate-chair@purdue.edu
leadership@purdue.edu 
robin437@purdue.edu
editor@purdueexponent.org

Copy them all so they can‚Äôt claim ‚Äúfailed transmission.‚Äù

Sample Message

I urge Purdue University to appeal the Tippecanoe Election Board‚Äôs Sept 27 decision to offer no election day voting on campus based on ‚Äúfailed transmission.‚Äù The Greater Lafayette republicans, the Greater Lafayette democrats, and the Greater Lafayette League of Women are all in agreement that this plan is inadequate. The Purdue Student Government is also on record that they need on campus election day voting. Please do not wait until your polling places are overwhelmed to find out that this plan will not accommodate the 7000 likely campus voters.

Question the numbers put forth in the part time employee‚Äôs powerpoint. They don‚Äôt add up. Since Tippecanoe county does not have precinct voting, anyone in the county can vote on campus.

2008: 3,475 on Election Day (Purdue Memorial Union); 3,793 early (two days at Stewart Center

Your current plan only allows for 1000 on campus voters. That leaves 6000 plus disenfranchised young people. Do the right thing! Appeal this decision. Protect your reputation. You are a research institution. Do the research!

Appeal the Sept 27 election board decision based on failed transmission NOW!
