I did the thing on Reach where you search for a person's name and you tag who they support, what issues matter to them, etc. I entered my girlfriend's name as a test. She has never signed up to volunteer and has never donated. She now got a text from the campaign today, about 2 months later. Is this info collected used for text banking? Or just unrelated and somehow she just got signed up ?"

Apparently they can pull the data daily and are updating accordingly (this is now mixing info I've gotten from phone bank trainings with the Reach team training, but there you have it)"
