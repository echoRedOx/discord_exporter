I was wondering if there are any ways for an individual to raise money for the campaign? I know you canâ€™t donate *for* someone else, but I havenâ€™t been able to find any rules and regulations regarding individual fundraising, whether itâ€™s through a shop where the proceeds go to the campaign or through a fundraiser. Iâ€™m trying to explore all my options for helping. ðŸ™‚ I havenâ€™t read through the entire server yet, so I figured Iâ€™d ask in case I missed the info somewhere or havenâ€™t found it yet."

One of the ways you can incorporate fundraising into your efforts is with hosting events. The events can be virtual or in-person, they can happen once or in a series and I believe the can be on-going. You can set up your event with https://events.democrats.org/host/ and then connect ActBlue to have your donors funds go directly to the campaign. Also check with the https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1242264464246440017 team, they may have more ideas. If you can't see that link, go to Channels & Roles at the top of your menu and select the Host Events option."
