  content: Musk photo from a neighbor. On second photo, items in blue are my feeble
    response. Not trying to reason with this person, just provide facts in response
    to his conspiracy theory.

  content: "Good morning Joyce! Thank you so much for fighting so hard against misinformation.\
    \ Autumn provided some awesome resources. \n\nDon't be dismayed if no resources\
    \ or data will sway many folks. Sometimes our effectiveness is best served by\
    \ knowing who is open and who is not and focusing on those who are open to discussing\
    \ issues and partial to facts and not conspiracy theories. And remember self-care!\
    \ \n\nSpending time with fence-sitters who are trying to make a decisions, rather\
    \ those who already have made a decision, is the most effective way to find more\
    \ votes for Kamala. \n\nThanks for the good, hard work you're doing!"

  content: I have seen that and some others. From what I read, they believe the ID
    at registration is sufficient. Folks on the right view the headline as ripe for
    voter fraud.
