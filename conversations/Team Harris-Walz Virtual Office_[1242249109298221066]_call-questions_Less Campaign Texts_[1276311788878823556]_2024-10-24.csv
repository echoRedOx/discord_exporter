[KY],1272730128006254675,assets\5-E9BDB.png,"Just finished my first round of calls, and several people I was able to speak with brought up that they were receiving an excessive amount of campaign texts (one even saying if it wasn’t such an important election, it would cause him to not vote out of frustration). Is there anyone I can get in touch with to share this particular caller’s info? And, is there any way to slow down the amount of texts people are receiving?"

The best answer I can give you is to tell those folks to respond ""STOP"" to the fundraising/campaign texts. Believe me, I get inundated with all these texts and calls and there really is not much we can do other than telling them to respond with ""STOP""."

As someone on the staff at Wilmington HQ, I do not do much collaboration with PACs in terms of outreach/facilitating phone banks. They also can access public voter files and contact these folks via text/call on their own accord as an organization. I can speak on the DNC, in that we are a growing team, and lately have been able to help each other free up capacity to improve our processes."

Personally, I don't get bent out of shape by the texts, but I can imagine for some of our fellow citizens, the volume is causing anxiety, disgust, and frustration."

No real judgement coming from over here but I can completely understand why people would be turned off by the bombardment of texts (and emails) coming in. I've wondered if it's turning off potential voters. Hopefully once this election is over there will be space to reflect and streamline communications for future elections.

I'm volunteering, but I expect others would be put off by it. I do wonder if we are helping though with the volume of calls?"

But yes, I have donated, but still get bombarded. First, it’s Nevada Democrats, then deep south turn blue, then another pac, and another pac.

And none of them seem to be aware that I’ve already given a great deal"
