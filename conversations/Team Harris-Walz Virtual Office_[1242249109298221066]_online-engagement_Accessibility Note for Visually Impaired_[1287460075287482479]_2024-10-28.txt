Content: I wanted to second <@941196169852366859> on the topic of screen captures and alt text. It is standard accessibility practice for any text that appears in an image to be included in alt text, because alt text is essential for screen readers. Not providing this functionality could be a violation of Section 508 guidelines.

Content: I never thought much about that, but you brought up a good point, Jen. I mostly thought about it because while I'm not blind, I do have a disability, so I understand the needs of the community. Also, like I said, I had a friend in college who was legally blind, and she told me this a few years back.
