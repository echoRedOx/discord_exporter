  content: This is fine, but I don't quite understand your request.  By the way, I
    can only pass onto the [content created by volunteers](https://app.reach.vote/library/gallery/c07cfbbe-ed31-4770-8303-833364ba39b8?campaign=democrats)
    gallery by the Content Brigade.

  content: My request was that the folder for LGBTQ+ content be updated. None of the
    ones in there are wrong, and they're all semi relevant, but there's not a lot
    of newer content to share about what the race looks like for LGBTQ people now.
    Maybe we add some graphics or videos of quotes from Harris and Walz, like more
    content from when Harris visited the RuPaul set or content about Walz being the
    head of the G/S alliance? It's only a suggestion!

  content: Sorry, that's the LGBTQ+ Democratic Coalition's gallery.  (The Content
    Brigade only has the [content created by volunteers](https://app.reach.vote/library/gallery/c07cfbbe-ed31-4770-8303-833364ba39b8?campaign=democrats)
    gallery.)  You can ask if Out For Harris-Walz controls the LGBTQ+ gallery.
