Content: translation to EN: "FLOP! COWBOY CARTER has officially left Spotify's global weekly albums chart in less than 5 months.

The album spent just 19 weeks on the charts, despite a huge marketing campaign, massive promotion and being labeled "the album that revived country music"."

Content: translation of proposed note to EN: "The album was and is a cultural and representative success, impacting US country music dominated by white singers. With it, Beyonc√© becomes the first woman with the first 8 solo and unreleased albums at number one on Billboard upon release."
