Content: I got an email this afternoon about volunteer shifts(!), but of the roles I felt qualified for only one of them actually had shifts available and it’s for tomorrow. Too short notice to get off work. ☹️ There really wasn’t much that had openings in general.

Content: Hey all, Aurora resident here.
I have convinced my entire immediate family (Mom, Stepdad, Sister, and Myself of course) to get out and vote blue up and down the ballot this November.

I also convinced my sister to take a shot at being an election judge this year, because lord knows we don't want any election deniers doing that for us.

I am proud that the first time I was legally able to vote was in the Primary as a registered Democrat, and that the first time I will vote in a general election will be for Kamala Harris and against Dictator Donald.

Fellow Illinois residents, let's fight together keep the blue wall strong. Because, when we fight...

Content: Hi! Checking in from Chicago, Do you know if we're going to be doing any sort of postcard event in the city? I'd be interested in helping with that. I remember getting a postcard from the person who was running for my alderman in the last election, and it actually did leave an impact. Plus, I know I like getting mail that's not a bill or a request for money, so I'm sure there's other people like that out there.

I also liked how organized the phone banking is.  If you have not done it, try it you're not obligated to continue. A few calls from everybody still helps.  Let's do this ... NOT GOING BACK, we broke up with you Bro as Hakeem Jeffries said!!!  Along with other notable speeches his speech was awesome. You can listen on YouTube to Hakeem Jeffries speech. I'm a fan.

Content: Good Day All ☀️
Last night debate was good! Trump showed his true self and when someone shows you who they are, BELIEVE IT. BELIEVE THEM. We all know our assignment. Vote BLUE all the way to the ballot box 🗳️🇺🇸💙

Trump never answered the debate questions. He didn't speak on his policies/plans for the future.  What he did do was attack America with fear, (crime, illegal border crossing, racism, division, discord, chaos, economy collapse, people eating dogs and cats, etc...). 
The world 🌎 will not collapse. America 🇺🇸 will NOT fall apart as Trump spoke. Trump attacked America, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and others. Not one good thing did he speak on how to make America great. 
When we fight we win!

Content: <@739562507286347856> - It is important to be fair to all working people regardless of age, ability status or job type. I am proud that Kamala Harris will work to increase the federal minimum wage and end the discriminatory practice of paying some folks less.  This is an excerpt from the issues page of the campaign site, under Support American Innovation and Workers.

Content: All I can report from <#1268376729500651592> #IL is that there are almost no political signs anywhere.

Yes we have one nutcase with the confederate flag and a trump flag on his giant truck, but everyone avoids him.

In 2020, I saw political signs everywhere, even though we've never been a battleground state. 

People were stealing signs from their neighbors' lawns. ...Horrible.

This time, it's like everyone is zipped up.

We'll find out what they are thinking after the votes come in.

Content: HI <@739562507286347856> - I know you are working on online content, right? and also regarding voting, you can pre-register as a 17 year old, and in 2025 you can vote for your first election. In that case, it will be a local or state election, but every election is important. 🙂

Content: Illinois isn't a swing state, I get that this is Harris country. But how can I help local dems? I'm in state house district 48, which is a moderate suburban chicago district that voted biden +3 in 2020 but was flipped by Jennifer Sanalitro in 2022. She's a republican who was at January 6, so the dems can possibly beat her if we get the word out about her being a terrorist

Content: Hi <@688839107715137570> if you have a digital file of the image you can print at your local library. if you want to print larger you can go to a FedEx Office shop or an office supply store and they can print for you. You can download free digital files of other signs https://store.kamalaharris.com/digital-downloads/

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: Hi leaders,

I'm a board member with Project XV and I could sure use some help. My ask is related to this campaign, too.

This year marks 154 years since the enactment of Amendment XV (African American suffrage); 104 years since Amendment XIX (women’s suffrage); And 60 years since Amendment XXIV (abolish poll tax).

On Election Day, we’re asking thousands of people to help us publicize the history of voting rights in our country by posting a selfie on Facebook or Instagram with the note that “My right to vote was a FIGHT to vote” and tag @projectXVmuseum.

Can you help us reach out to folks in IL? We need to make sure that the public history of suffrage remains in our collective memory, and your help is essential to this work.

P.S., We do lots of voter registrations drives and would love volunteers (or curious cats)!

Content: Hello, <@&1245910335773474880> ! Loving these voting stickers and your plans to go in person canvass in the midwest! Some studies have shown that phone banking is as effective as in person canvass - and it's something you can do without needing to travel. We could REALLY use you in <#1242256751445934262> today to help us meet our 10 million call this weekend. If you can't join us today, this next week is absolutely critical, and we'd love if you could block out some time in your schedule to help us! If you're more experienced and ready to hit the ground running, you can go straight to the dialer [here](https://go.kamalaharris.com/dial/national?ref=natl_dis_host_discordveveryoneelse) ! Will you come give us a hand to get us across the finish line? Thanks, everyone! We're lucky to have you as part of this amazing team.

Content: Hi all, Just a bit of info if you VOTE by mail be aware that the mail is slow.... very slow...I suggest that you use dropbox if you can just to speed up the process.  The State of IL does not allow ballot tracking but each county does so check your county for the status of your Ballot.  Mine took 3 weeks to be delevered to the county for varification.  GO HARRIS -WALZ !!
