  content: "**What if the person I am calling is already volunteering?**\nThis is\
    \ great! You can mark them as \u201Cyes\u201D to volunteering, skip the text message,\
    \ and then end the call.\n\n**What if they want to do events with their local\
    \ party/local candidates/etc?**\nThey can go to their state party website (e.g.\
    \ texasdemocrats.org) or they can go to events.democrats.org and filter for events\
    \ in their area. \n\n**Do we do postcard events?**\nNo we do not, but there are\
    \ plenty of outside groups that do! The events we are calling and recruiting into\
    \ are our highest priority events at the moment, so we encourage you all to do\
    \ what you can to get sign ups for these."
