  content: Jamie, I'm right there with you.  I have done the work so I could see what
    I need to help others with, but the actual calling is not my cup of tea.  However,
    helping people with their questions helps get more people calling, so that's where
    you will shine!!  <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>
