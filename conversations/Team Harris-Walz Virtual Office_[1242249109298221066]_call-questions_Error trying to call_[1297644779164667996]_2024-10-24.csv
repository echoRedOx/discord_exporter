We just switched to WI, so that might have caused the glitch?"

Which I know is basically a fancy way of saying...have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in again. But actually disconnecting from my internet network and reconnecting has helped in certain situations."

I'll give that a go, cause I was still getting the error. Hopefully it's just me and not a bunch of callers."
