    \ for an Event > Attend event > Note any specific team deliverables > Discord\
    \ > Repeat\n\nAttend the event. Note any specific deliverables the host may request\
    \ from you. Come back to discord to engage with the community and teams you've\
    \ joined, find resources, and ask any additional questions you may have in your\
    \ team's main channel. Repeat. \n\nIf you have additional questions, you can ask\
    \ a moderator in <#1242249109298221069> or post your question to <#1267941954243526756>\
    \ for the entire virtual office leads and mods to answer.\n\n**DO THE EVENTS OFFER\
    \ TRAINING?**\n\nAll phone banking events offer training at the beginning of each\
    \ event. If you've already trained you can jump straight into the dialer and begin\
    \ making calls after reviewing the script for the event. \n\nOnline engagement,\
    \ Reach App, Vote Team and other events offer training events as well. At these\
    \ training events you will learn how to maximize the resources here in discord\
    \ and the Reach app for each activity and ask questions to that team. \n\n**WHERE\
    \ IS TEXT BANK TRAINING?**\n\nWe're so excited you'd like to help mobilize voters\
    \ through text banking! \n\nVolunteers like you are so energized and text banking\
    \ is so popular that our Text Team has limited capacity. Ask a moderator in <#1242249109298221069>\
    \ for our most current Text Team training events.** If you've already attended\
    \ a training, you can ask  about your status at <#1266829704204386334>.**\n\n\
    **In the meantime, phone banking is the most powerful campaigning we can do**,\
    \ so please consider trying it out by attending a training sessions. It's fun,\
    \ you get lots of support, and others will be right there in the Zoom doing it\
    \ with you! Many of our volunteers' most rewarding exchanges and lifelong stories\
    \ come from the connections they make with callers through phone banking.\n\n\
