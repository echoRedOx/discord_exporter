The Engage Action Muslim group endorsed Harris two weeks ago.  Here is an article on the Uncommitted group   https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/uncommitted-movement-kamala-harris-trump/index.html - ""‚ÄòUncommitted‚Äô leaders say group will not endorse Harris but warn against vote for Trump ‚Äúwhose agenda, they said in a statement, ‚Äúincludes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing.‚Äù The group also said it was ‚Äúnot recommending a third-party vote‚Äù because of the potential for ‚Äúinadvertently‚Äù helping Trump in key swing states.‚Äù  And another article appears to show some blink spots by the Dem's approach https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/04/politics/arab-muslim-americans-michigan-harris/index.html"

I suggest focusing on the close U.S. House races we need to win to regain the House: District 07 [several counties near Lansing] is the one Elissa Slotkin is leaving for her Senate run.   Here is a sign up for door knocking in that district    https://www.mobilize.us/onecampaignformichigan/event/632227/    District 08 [Bay City area] is open because Dan Kildee is retiring. District 10 [just north of Detroit] is where Dem Carl Marlinga is running. With the Michigan One Campaign, you will be able to work simultaneously for state, House, Senate & Presidential races.

You guys have been very helpful so far. I am coming to Michigan to volunteer from the 22-27 and still having a hard time figuring out where I can be most useful door knocking. I'm thinking of District 07 and wondering if anyone knows if there is a campaign office that I can go to get my walking lists?  I only see one time slot from 5-7 on Wednesday to help Hertel or a big Campaign for Michigan office in Lansing or around there.  I'd really like a home base campaign office since I'll be there for multiple days.  I realize that might be such a 2016 thought since it seems like the campaigns are set up differently now.  Also since I'm looking for ways to help during the day on weekdays, there doesn't seem to be as much set up."
