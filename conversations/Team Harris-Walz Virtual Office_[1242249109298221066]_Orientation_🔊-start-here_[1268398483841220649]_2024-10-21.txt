**Welcome to the DNC's Team Harris Virtual Office discord server team! **And be on the lookout for friendly reminders and guidance from our bot we affectionately call DemCord.

We feel and share your excitement and energy to mobilize and help elect Kamala Harris as President, Tim Walz as VP, and Democrats up and down the ballot in November (well, really, starting in September with early voting). 

To start, tap or click on server title in the sidebar (Team Harris-Walz Virtual Office heading). In the dropdown menu, select "Show all channels" and tap/click anywhere to close. 

Now, let's take a look at our <id:guide> where you will find our Community Guidelines and our detailed Channel Guide. You can alternate between the two by clicking or tapping on the tabs for each.

Please make note of the guidelines and acknowledge them with an emoji. Most are the expected norms of kindness and respect. __Note rule 3 in particular__. We have a dedicated channel for posting non-official events (e.g. mailing postcards, canvassing, GOTV, etc), <#1268426751164551199>, and these events are prohibited anywhere else on the server*. Non-official (not hosted by the Democratic National Committee) fundraising events are prohibited anywhere on this server per campaign finance law. By participating in the server you are bound by these guidelines.*

If you need a mod, please tag <@&1266883962727432304> for general assistance.

> **Now for the fun...** 

In the sidebar you'll see categories. You're currently in Orientation. Sub-levels below each category are the channels within that category. Channels are chat rooms or forums. 

Click or tap on a category to collapse or expand it. Click or tap on a channel to view and engage where available. Note: You can respond with emojis in channels where messages aren't allowed. And if you can't see an expected category yet, you'll be added soon!

There are categories for each mobilizing action like our Calls Team and Online Engagement Team. This is where you'll likely spend most of your time. Each team has its own instructions in the channel descriptions. Once you enter a channel, click or tap on the title bar to read the channel description, which will have direction for how to use each channel. You can also familiarize yourself with each team's channels here: <#1274062346272117028>.

We also have loads of resources and are adding more frequently. For instance, if you'd like to get current messaging for online engagement, you can visit:<#1250551051002839131>. 

If you'd like Content Brigade memes and social media graphics you can post to social media, <#1250876565366243348> is a goldmine! (You can also apply to be on the Content Brigade team, which has its own server, via the channel description). You can even share your own memes--created or seen in the wild--in <#1265762143559618624>. 

And don't forget to <#1242256950402744431> , where all of our server social media content and DNC messaging and content are. You can take the two trainings for online engagement by registering for an event at https://events.democrats.org. 

Once you've gotten settled in with navigating categories and channels, you can check out The Stage where staff hosts live viewing parties and major events.

And finally, visit <#1268398608097476750> next to see some of the current FAQs and a clear, easy pattern for your ongoing action and success! When questions come up, you can ask a mod in <#1267941954243526756> or <#1242249109298221069>. 

This is a people-powered campaign and we can't get to the White House without YOU! So thank you for your passion, commitment, and inspiration in paving the way to victory in 2024! 

Now, let's get to work - together!
