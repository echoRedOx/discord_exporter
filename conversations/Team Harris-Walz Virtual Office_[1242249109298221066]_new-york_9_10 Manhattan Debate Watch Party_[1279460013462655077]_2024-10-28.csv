We were looking around Columbus Circle and reached out to McGee's (W55 and Broadway) - there's a cover of $500 and a max of 70 people. Was going to see if we can find a place where we can host for free. If you have any ideas, let us know!"

No cover, 2 drink minimum. Also Mary O’s Irish Pub is hosting their own for $23 with 1 drink included. Just options"

That's great - I reached out to a few other places to see what they say. Are either of you planning to attend the info session tomorrow @ 4:30? I'll join, but might be 15min late. 
Wonder if we could tag on to one of the existing events (if anything) and register it through the dems or if it has to be stand-alone. 
And if we can't get our own going, down to join somewhere lol."
