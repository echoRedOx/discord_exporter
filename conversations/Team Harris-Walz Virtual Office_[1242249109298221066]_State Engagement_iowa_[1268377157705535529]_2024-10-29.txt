Content: On this day 4 years ago, a record 3.3 million Americans cast their ballot early.  And as expected, only 1.7 million early votes have been cast (a 45% decrease).  Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/

Content: Great to hear you want to vote early!

Iowa has two options:
1. In person: Visit your local polling place any time starting ***today***, October 16th! ([This site](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterreg/pollingplace/search.aspx) can show your polling place.)
2. By mail: Request a mail ballot by 5 PM on October 21st. Then mail it so it arrives by 8 PM on November 5th, or drop it off in person at the county auditor.

There's also lots more information [right here](https://iwillvote.com/votinginfo/IA).

Content: Good question! If you're already registered to vote, you can still use your driver's license if it's been expired for *90 days or less*.

If it's been expired longer, there are other options like a passport or a "voter ID", which you can get from the county.

[More info here](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/voteridfaq.html) and in this PDF.

Content: Hmmm. I'm not 100% sure. [This article](https://www.vox.com/21523858/ballot-selfies-state-rules) from 2020 says it was okay, though. Folks at the courthouse might also be able to weigh in if you're still there.

[This page](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/secrecy-of-the-ballot-and-ballot-selfies) says Iowa election officials have suggested two other good alternatives:
1. A selfie next to the "vote here sign"
2. A picture of the ballot box or kiosk itself, rather than the ballot

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: Hey folks! Thank you for joining us. **Together, we will write the next chapter in the greatest story ever told.**

Phonebanking is our **number one priority** so close to the election, and it‚Äôs a phenomenal way to get started. We often set goals for specific numbers, like how we set a goal for 5 million calls this past weekend. We made 4.6 million, reaching immense numbers of people!

We‚Äôre 300,000 calls behind our goal for the day, and we urgently need to call Wisconsin voters. Early voting starts today in Wisconsin, and people need voting plans! We‚Äôre only **14 days away** from the election!

[Can we count on you to help us? Please, click here to get started and call directly into Wisconsin!](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=32641249-daa7-4253-b97b-df11f362bdb3&ref=go_kh_calls_wi&utm_source=hfp_w_go_calls_20241022&utm_campaign=hfp_w_go_mb_do_vol_vrec_calls_20241022&utm_medium=go_kh_calls_20241022&utm_term=go_kh_calls_20241022)

We know it‚Äôs scary for many of you. I have the same anxiety as well. But a second trump administration is much scarier. We can do this!
