  content: Hi I'm working with Disabled Voters for Harris, to make a video with them
    to promote voters in the disability community to vote for Harris, and the organizer
    mentioned to me that she's tried to contact someone about acessiblity issues in
    Reach and hasn't been able to reach anyone.  To whom could I direct her? Thanks!

  content: Hey! Thank you for posting this. The Kamala's Captains were talking about
    how to support visually impaired folks who want to phone bank. If you have any
    suggestions, can I put you in touch?

  content: hi. if this is for Discord accessibliity, you can use ctrl/cmd + to make
    the discord text much larger. I also see Calls team has a voice channel to do
    the support over audio instead of on screen. Maybe KC can use a voice channel

  content: 'Elizabeth - I did not even know that there was a Disabled Voters for Harris
    group. We are looking for ways to make Zoom Phone Banking more accessible, so
    if anyone has any ideas, let me know.


    <@568257600228032512> - Thank you for checking in. Unfortunately, Zoom Phone Banking
    happens over "Scale to Win", so we cannot make the text bigger. I do not think
    anyone in KC needs a voice channel -- it is volunteers who need a voice channel.'

  content: I think Calls team uses the voice channel to talk with volunteers who don't
    enjoy reading the screen. I don't know anything about Scale to Win, but the Ctrl/Cmd
    + works on all pages in Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Safari.
