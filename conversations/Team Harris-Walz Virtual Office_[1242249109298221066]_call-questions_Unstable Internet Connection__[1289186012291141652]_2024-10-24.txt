Content: Hi, I wanted to ask about the feasibility of using the dialer on an unstable internet connection. I used to have no problems, but have now been forced to move the router in my home so my PC occasionally disconnects from WiFi. I don't think I can do any more phonebanking using my computer's audio, but it is possible to still use my phone for audio while my PC is connected to the dialer? Or will a drop in WiFi still cause my calls to disconnect? I'm so sorry about all this.

Content: My WiFi is also unstable, and I have no problems using my phone for audio. ðŸ™‚

Content: OK, good to know. I'll try another phonebank soon and see how it goes. It stinks because I like phonebanking and feel like I'm doing something good, but now I'm worried I'd do more harm than good if I disconnect in the middle of calls.

Content: My phone has never once disconnected in the middle of a call. I hope that makes you more confident about phone banking!
