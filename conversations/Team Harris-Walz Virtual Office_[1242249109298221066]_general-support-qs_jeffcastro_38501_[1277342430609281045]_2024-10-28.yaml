  content: Hi Alison!  Would you mind posting your question in <#1263529508300914809>
    also?  They may be able to answer it faster, if we can get some eyes on it from
    people who know calls!

  content: You can try going into <id:customize> and click "talk to voters in key
    states" and it should add the call role to you to see that channel I think --
