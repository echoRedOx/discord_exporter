Content: Hi Vera! <@368807878926008341> and I started looking into this - she's UWS and I'm midtown east. We were looking around Columbus Circle and reached out to McGee's (W55 and Broadway) - there's a cover of $500 and a max of 70 people. Was going to see if we can find a place where we can host for free. If you have any ideas, let us know!

Content: Also don't think we're tied to columbus circle, was just an idea based on where we were located at the time

Content: Columbus Circle works for me. My husband would join as well. $500 is not too bad if we get 50-70ppl.

Content: Looks like a group called Braver Angels (they seem to be bipartisan but may lean right?) is hosting at Everything’s Jake on 13th st. No cover, 2 drink minimum. Also Mary O’s Irish Pub is hosting their own for $23 with 1 drink included. Just options

Content: Sorry! I didn't have notifications on. That's great - I reached out to a few other places to see what they say. Are either of you planning to attend the info session tomorrow @ 4:30? I'll join, but might be 15min late. 
Wonder if we could tag on to one of the existing events (if anything) and register it through the dems or if it has to be stand-alone. 
And if we can't get our own going, down to join somewhere lol.
