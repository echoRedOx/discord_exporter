People sign up on the same site. Unfortunately, I don't know where there is just an appearance schedule for just the leaders.  I imagine that information is sparsed out for security concerns. I was responsible for George HW Bush's visit to Disney (yeah, LONG time ago) and I couldn't even tell my husband what I was doing."
