Content: Hi all, 

 I just finished my first phone bank shift and really enjoyed it! I’d like to do it more and saw some mentions about an anytime calling group. 

1) Do I need to complete a separate training to participate in the anytime calling group? 

2) If not, is there a link I could use to log onto the dialer whenever I have a few spare minutes?

Thanks for all y’all do! Feels awesome to actually get involved and I’m excited to do more ◡̈

Content: There is an anytime crew you could join, just need to attend a training first! https://events.democrats.org/event/551644/?

Content: Ok, thank you! So this is different from the training I just did for a scheduled phone bank?

Content: It is! (Though I’m sure some of the basics are the same!). It appears that that training will then allow you to schedule calls outside of the block window calls. And thank YOU for what you’re doing too!
