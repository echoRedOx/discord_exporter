  content: I went to local chapter events for the first time ever last week and it
    was great. Being an American watching the depressing stuff we've observed over
    the past few years (DJT, J6, terrible SCOTUS decisions) has felt lonely, and through
    the local chapter I got to meet a lot of other Americans who understand the experience
    and are plugged into efforts to do something about it. I really needed that.

  content: yes i know what you mean about the loneliness, being abroad makes one feel
    kind of powerless like you're watching a train crash. So it would be good to get
    nvolved in something. The local chapter is not super near me but I will make an
    effort to attend some events at some point ( and do online volunteering)
