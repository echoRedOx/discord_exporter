Content: I had a voter with a learning disability who is not able to read the ballot on their own, and I felt like the iwillvote.com website does not really address this scenario? Am I missing it? Thankfully they were already aware of getting in touch with their municipal clerk's office and could have a friend help them complete their ballot, but please advise how we should handle this and other disability access needs on a call in the future.

Content: To add on to your question, you can also give the voter assistance hotline number to them if they have issues navigating websites. You had the right instinct about their local clerk's office but anything you're not able to speak to iwillvote.com & the hotline are the resources that will best assist them!

Content: Thanks. I did refer them to the iwillvote.com website as well but I didnâ€™t feel confident that their question would be answered. It would be nice if the website mentioned anything about disability access (even just a mention and note to call the hotline). Many disabled people feel like they are on their own and donâ€™t know that they have options. Good to know the hotline will be prepared.
