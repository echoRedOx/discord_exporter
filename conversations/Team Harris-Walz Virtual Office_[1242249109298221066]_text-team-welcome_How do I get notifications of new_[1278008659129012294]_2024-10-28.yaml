  content: Hey <@1262618334143316031> and <@1277040706212331531> I hear you! We're
    hoping to have a more consistent schedule soon, or at least more availability
    (we were texting *so much* last week during the convention). And some of the lists
    yesterday were smaller, so they went quicker. In terms of notifications, you can
    mute a lot of the other channels and just have <#1245442408305393675> s and <#1265788349747171438>
    set to notify you! **[Here's more info on managing notifications](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215253258-Notifications-Settings-101)**
    in Discord (i.e. you can mute a lot of the community channels like <#1242264162948874360>
    / <#1242249109298221069> / even <#1265788524653707366> if you want)
