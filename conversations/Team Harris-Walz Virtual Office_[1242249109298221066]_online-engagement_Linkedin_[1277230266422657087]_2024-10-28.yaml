  content: 'I''m a premium Linkedin user ($30/month) . This plan unlocks a number
    of useful benefits like featured application statuses, InMail functionality, and
    of course the social network''s AI features (actually seeing who has opened your
    post and providing analytics).  This has been extremely useful relative to making
    direct contact with friends in my network and encouraging them to engage the Kamala/Tim
    campaign (while also allowing me to touch base with friends I haven''t checked
    in with for years).   I''m using messaging to continue existing conversation threads.


    Who''s using Linkedin and do you have other thoughts about its effective use in
    relational organizing in the digital sphere?'
