I ended up in online engagement, but I'm not really social media savvy. How do I switch my role to something like back office volunteering or data entry or postcards? Thanks!"

Just go back to <id:customize> <click/tap here and deselect/select the roles you prefer. Vote Team is the best place for data entry type work. We do not have a team doing postcards at this time. Thank you!

I signed up for Data Captain training for this Wed. night. But on Channels & Roles I don't see an option for Vote Team.

So you'll get access instructions in your training essentially! Very soon! Almost there!
