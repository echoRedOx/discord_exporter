  content: 'Slightly random question that may or may not be right for this channel:
    I spend a lot of my workday in Excel, cleaning and entering medim-sized downloads
    of data. Could those Excel skills be useful for the campaign, as all this calling/canvassing/texting
    data comes in or as lists from other orgs are prepped for those activities? I''ve
    been doing texting, here and for Contest Every Race, and can continue with that,
    just wondering if my Excel skills could be useful as well.'
