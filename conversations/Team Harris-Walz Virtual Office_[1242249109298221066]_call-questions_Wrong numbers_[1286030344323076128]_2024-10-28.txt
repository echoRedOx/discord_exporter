Content: Just wanted to ask if the Democratic Party actually removes wrong numbers from our lists. I’ve had countless people tell me we’ve been calling the wrong person for the last decade, in some cases as much as the past 15 years.

Content: Yes wrong numbers are removed from the DNC list but there are multiple groups calling voters using the same public voter records so if number is wrong in the public voter records, will again pop up as wrong. And yes this can recycle for years.
