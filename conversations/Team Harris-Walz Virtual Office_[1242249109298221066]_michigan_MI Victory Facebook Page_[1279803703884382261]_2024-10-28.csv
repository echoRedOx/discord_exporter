No, I am not responsible for the Facebook page. Iâ€™m not clear who is assigned to moderate or post content to those state pages. Many are newer. (Remember THIS campaign is just a month old.) Perhaps a staff member can assist you? Or you can ask in the questions channel. Happy holiday weekend. Thanks for volunteering."
