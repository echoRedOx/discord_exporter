Content: I'll DM you shortly. I'm copying the link now. But to your question, we're starting off to confirm attendees to the Walz rally in Ashville, NC! Thanks so much for supporting!

Content: did shift from 9-11am -good experience confirming ID attendees were coming 2 rally in NC. stayed on for next shift (which I stayed for part of) & did more calls confirming whether ppl would b attending. then when I got finished w tht I signed out. I had had enough for the moment.  that was a pleasant shift as well. I did the debrief forms but reporting back here cuz I just remembered I think we're sposed to? anyway. it was nice-2 ppl I called thanked ME for volunteering which was kind of them & I appreciated. ðŸ™‚
