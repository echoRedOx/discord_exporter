Content: This isnâ€™t so much a question as it is feedback. In the call trainings it might be nice to encourage callers to keep a little notepad/journal when they call; that way if they come up with lines or ways of phrasing things that they really like, they can keep reusing them. I also think we should put an emphasis on smiling before people start each call. People on the other end can really hear the difference. My two cents. Thanks.
