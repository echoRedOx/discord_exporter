Here's an example of an allowed source as it is a state run site. https://www.mo.gov/government/elections-and-voting.  You can do the same for MT or any other state."

Therefore, just share the official sources and treat the rest as noise.  Of course, if there is an issue, we have legal groups and voter protection groups to address whatever really exists."

I found Share America more universal though for general news, because language inclusivity is important. One of the many things we do not want to lose in our democracy."
