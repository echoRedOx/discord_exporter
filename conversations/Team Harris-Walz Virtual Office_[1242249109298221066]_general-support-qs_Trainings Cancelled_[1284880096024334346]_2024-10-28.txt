Content: I was signed up to do training for chat MOD and phone bank MOD and I got an email that those trainings were cancelled and was told I need to sign up for a new training "Kamala's Captains". Are all MOD trainings now encompassed in this one training?

Content: <@1210813809879416882> I believe they will be. Current mods just attended a meeting where we were told of a rebranding/ restructuring to have one broad umbrella (Kamala's Captains), so what you received is in line with that.
