**HOW DO I GET STARTED VOLUNTEERING AND WHAT DO I DO NEXT? **

## **Click [here](https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1268398608097476750/1283468733322629140) to look over every kind of training and volunteer event we offer. **

Register for an Event > Attend event > Note any specific team deliverables > Discord > Repeat

Attend the event. Note any specific deliverables the host may request from you. Come back to discord to engage with the community and teams you've joined, find resources, and ask any additional questions you may have in your team's main channel. Repeat. 

If you have additional questions, you can ask a moderator in <#1242249109298221069> or post your question to <#1267941954243526756> for the entire virtual office leads and mods to answer.

**DO THE EVENTS OFFER TRAINING?**

All phone banking events offer training at the beginning of each event. If you've already trained you can jump straight into the dialer and begin making calls after reviewing the script for the event. 

Online engagement, Reach App, Vote Team and other events offer training events as well. At these training events you will learn how to maximize the resources here in discord and the Reach app for each activity and ask questions to that team. 

**WHERE IS TEXT BANK TRAINING?**

We're so excited you'd like to help mobilize voters through text banking! 

Volunteers like you are so energized and text banking is so popular that our Text Team has limited capacity. Ask a moderator in <#1242249109298221069> for our most current Text Team training events.** If you've already attended a training, you can ask  about your status at <#1266829704204386334>.**

**In the meantime, phone banking is the most powerful campaigning we can do**, so please consider trying it out by attending a training sessions. It's fun, you get lots of support, and others will be right there in the Zoom doing it with you! Many of our volunteers' most rewarding exchanges and lifelong stories come from the connections they make with callers through phone banking.
