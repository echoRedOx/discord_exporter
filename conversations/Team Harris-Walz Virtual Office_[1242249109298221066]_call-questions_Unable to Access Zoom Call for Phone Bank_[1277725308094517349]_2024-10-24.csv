I signed up for the 4pm Phone Bank, and ran into the following ZOOM login message/error on multiple devices, two different computers and iphone, over about a 30 minute period of checking from around 3:45 to 4:15pm.

""The host requires authentication on commercial Zoom platform to join this meeting. Please sign in with a commercial zoom account to join.""

Will sign up for more phone banks in the future, but wanted to share in case any other callers run into this issue."

Please bare with us as we also try and get used to this new format. We just want to make sure everyone feels heard and not skipped out on!"
