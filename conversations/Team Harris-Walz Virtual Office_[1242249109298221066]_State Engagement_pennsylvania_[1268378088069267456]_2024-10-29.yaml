  content: An extreme swing county. It's so bad that the Ashley Ehaz Campaign is desperately
    looking for phone bank people. I was doing it but I'm starting to train for the
    DNC's Vote Team so I don't know how much of a commitment I can do. If anyone wants
    info on the campaign's phonebanks, DM me.

  content: Don't we all? I live two towns over from where his family grew up and I
    can tell you he's not a good person. Rarely shows up at events and when he does
    virtual town halls, if you comment with something that he doesn't agree with,
    they boot you out. The only reason why this guy got noticed in the first place
    is his late brother was the Congressman before him and to be honest, I liked his
    brother more than him because at least his brother showed up at things.

    I do recall a lot of Fetterman signs and Shapiro at this time of year. We're very
    rural, so not much vandalism as so much as just not as many democrats lol

  content: Also, if you want to find out about more opportunities, fill out this Mobilize
    link. We have three US Congressional seats in PA that are in desperate need to
    be kept blue  and two that need to be flipped. Bob Casey needs to be reelected,
    the PA House needs to stay blue and the Senate needs to be flipped. Also 19 electoral
    votes. Biden won PA by a little over 80K votes in 2020 and HRC lost PA in 2016
    by less than 1% so we really are the Keystone State. https://www.mobilize.us/padems/event/612027/

  content: The biggest stumbling block I'm running into is WHERE to have people meet
    to gather / sign in / get a short training? FT6 suggests a coffee shop and then
    do the training basically outside in the parking lot or someting which seems really
    uncomfortable to me. I've been scouting out some other places like maybe the Mt.
    Lebanon city skate center next to the high school where they have some rooms to
    rent and plenty of parking? Have people gather, have some coffee and snacks to
    take with them, do the training and then send them out to the locations?

  content: Yeah FT6 discourages using a table and suggests going to places like college
    campuses and court houses with 2 or 3 people just walking around. But their documentation
    says that like 1-4 signups (per person) per session is great and 5 is huge, just
    to give context about their expectations!

    middle of the state. One man, who talked my ear off for 40 mins because he was
    just so happy to talk to someone who shared his politics, as he lives in a red
    area, and his kids married staunch republicans. Lol. He was really upset about
    that. But he said that there are a lot less Trump signs around this cycle, which
    is a sign, I think, that voters can be swayed if we just talk to them -- actually,
    not so much talk as LISTEN. Then ask questions. And listen some more.

  content: Hi <#1268378088069267456> , excited to land here, after my "how to get
    involved in the campaign" training! I live out of state but am considering spending
    some time with family in Philly so I can canvass for the campaign. It looks like
    there is an office on Chelton Ave (in Germantown) that would be accessible for
    me to get to. Does anyone know if there is a phone number for the office that
    I can call or If I will be able to walk in to find a buddy and start canvassing
    in the area? (My main concern is I do not have a car when I am visitting but the
    Chelton Ave location looks accessible.) Any advice / Suggestions?

    for you to contact them once you sign up for a shift. I still keep in touch with
    a couple of former ones from '22, to be honest.

    this time around if it weren't for the fact that I messed up my knee so bad that
    the only surgical option is joint replacement and the doctor said I'm not a good
    canidate on account of age...I'm too young. It's a good way to get in the door
    for future work though.

  content: <@746403830073262152> I truly love your point about listening and asking
    questions. it is so fascinating to learn from people with different worldviews
    and find the common ground. I read a book called "Never Split the Difference"
    by Chris Voss, a former hostage negotiator and he talks all about "tactical empathy",
    listening, mirroring, summarizing what the other person is telling you and clarifying
    that you got their point right" instead of knee jerk reacting which I hopefully
    have learned to do less of ! 8)

  content: 'Hey everyone, I''m Mike from Montgomery County outside Philly. I''m new
    to political campaigns and am really worried about Trump getting back in power.
    I want to do everything I can to prevent that. I''m excited about Kamala''s chances
    and want to help.


    I''ve noticed a lack of yard signs for Harris/Walz in my area, and it''s been
    bugging me to see mostly trump signs going up. I''m thinking of ordering 100-500
    signs to put up around Lansdale (Hatfield, Skippack, Blue Bell, Montgomeryville).
    I have no experience with this and would need people to take care of everything
    other than getting the signs.


    I''m looking to gauge interest and thoughts on whether it''s a good idea. I''ve
    heard signs aren''t that effective, but it really does bug me. It just doesn''t
    look great at this point.'

  content: Mike I'm in your area and happy to help, but unfortunately you can only
    place them in your own yard. You could set up a table or something up in a high
    traffic area (the mall, library, etc - with permission) and talk to people about
    the Harris campaign and offer one sign each if they want it. This will hopefully
    get more signs up in your area AND possibly inform/mobilize people to vote Harris
    in Nov.  I'm happy to help!

  content: Kriten, that makes sense, I'm sure there's a lot more demand than supply
    right now. To be clear, I'm not looking to get my hands on one or two signs. I
    want to order 300 or so custom-printed signs and get them distributed in my area.
    I've emailed the county office and will call on Monday (no one answered when I
    called today) and will be contacting other local Dem groups too.

    happy that I have seen many fewer Trump signs than in the recent past - our immediate
    neighbor no longer has the entire side of her barn advertising the orange monster
    - it is a freshly painted gray!  And my mom's book club is going to do a chunk
    of my postcards today! Small wins & a wonderful start to the week!

  content: Hi everyone, I hope this is a good place to ask about this. I live in central
    NJ, and I'd be interested in writing postcards for Matt Cartwright or Susan Wild,
    or both, and I'd be fine with coming to pick them up. I am also happy to mail
    them in nearby PA. I've left email and phone messages for both campaigns, but
    haven't heard anything back, and I've also looked on mobilize and found nothing.
    I did this two years ago; doesn't anyone know whether it's something they want
    help with now, and if it is, how to get involved? Thanks!

    Thankfully I'm in more purple Bucks County and was told if I went to the satelite

    one. They even had a drop box for me to put it in.

  content: Which is weird because where I live the drop boxes are either in a county
    building or their in a place like a police station. For instance where I live
    in Bucks County I could go to the satellite office for my County government services
    or I could take it to a Dropbox that's right in the town hall where the police
    station for my town is. That's really weird but that's Pennsylvania for you.

  content: Okay thanks for letting me know. Like I said I don't really know that area
    too well because I'm originally from Southern New Jersey for one and for another
    while I live near Philadelphia I'm in lower Bucks County so I'm more familiar
    with that area and Northeast Philly.

    general has done. I found this out from a friend in Georgia who told me that they've
    experienced the same issues and it was so bad that even mail that was not election
    related has had issues.

  content: "I would point to her policies about taxes or prices:\n* H/W's /issues\
    \ page states that no one making more than $400K will pay more taxes. In contrast,\
    \ the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center (to name one such group opposing Trumponomics\
    \ 2024) says Trump's plan to make his earlier tax cuts (for rich people) would\
    \ increase the national debt by more than $4 trillion over the next 10 years,\
    \ and *increase* taxes for 13% of middle-income Americans. \n* On prices, the\
    \ H/W agenda calls out \"anti-competitive practices that let big corporations\
    \ jack up prices and undermine the competition.\" This is where the issues lie\u2014\
    corporate greed. In general I have been really excited to hear both H and W talk\
    \ about shifting some of the power away from corporations and back to workers.\
    \ Like, they spend a *lot* of time on it. Also: Walz is not rich\u2014he doesn't\
    \ even own stock\u2014so he likely goes to the supermarket himself sometimes and\
    \ knows first-hand. \n\nPersonally neither of the above is my #1 reason for backing\
    \ H/W\u2014my top reasons are \"won't sell out to dictators\" and \"won't become\
    \ a dictator\"\u2014but I thought about what my Western PA dad would complain\

    they do that again somewhere in Bucks County since I loved when a bunch of them
    drove past a canvas launch site in Bensalem in 2020 with Biden signs.

  content: Just so everyone knows, you can apply for a vote by mail ballot now. Use
    the links Jack mentioned. The ballots will start hitting mail boxes around October
    so check with your county. PS. If you live in Bucks County, they start mailing
    out in mid-October.

  content: I know also in PA, the only time you're really asked for ID is when it's
    your first time voting in any precinct, and it can be as simple as a piece of
    mail addressed to you, however, Jack is right about the rest of that stuff. Another
    pro-tip, if you're going to your election office to get an on-demand VBM (vote
    by mail) ballot, I find showing them ID helps find you quicker when you hand them
    the paperwork.

    help with the campaign. I am available to volunteer full time, 40+ hours a week
    for the 3 weeks I am there.  I recently retired from a middle management "Big
    5" corporate job, so have lots of skills and am ready to be put to work.  I will
    also have a car.  Who can I reach out to get involved?  <@1260983976483356767>
    or <@941196169852366859> - I signed up for slack.  Please feel free to PM me.  I
    am happy to sign up on Mobilize, however, that seems for more 1 off opportunities.  Didn't
    know if having someone dedicated for 3 weeks straight could be used for other
    things?  Please let me know.  Thanks!

  content: Not sure where to post this - so starting in this thread. I assume you
    are aware, but re-stating it since I just experienced it this weekend while travelling
    to PA as an out of state volunteer.     Trump direct, or a superpac  is flooding
    the highways w/large digital signs in PA.  You literally can't drive around Reading
    and southeast PA w/o seeing them all the time.   Happy to share photos I took
    while driving.. they were so present.  Ones I saw   in the Reading, and SE PA
    area ( Rt 12 in Reading and 100/202 routes coming into PA from DE.  )   Its troubling,  -
    we might see a few hundred folks at any given local event, while thousands of
    (assuming  low information, hard to reach ?) voters are seeing these signs as
    they drive around the swing states.      Thoughts?

    near trump's resort said "Vote for Joe, Not the Psycho". I think "Voting Removes
    Tough Orange Stains" and "Grab Him By the Ballot" would make nice billboards.

    saw i wasn't recorded and called my county voter office because I knew I returned
    it. Thankfully a nice lady at the Bucks County Voter office was able to find that
    it was recorded but someone forgot to mark it in the database. Don't ask me how
    it happened but it happened.

    even get paid their normal pay rate not the tiny stipend poll workers receive.   Some
    buy food for the crew with the stipend so everyone has enough energy to power

  content: Some older voters I spoke to while phone banking stated that only men were
    supposed to be in positions of authority and they just could not vote for a woman
    as president (men and women said this). However, they were not voting for Trump.
    Sooo I changed topic to issues they were concerned about. Healthcare and drug
    costs were top of mind for them. I was able to persuade a few to Harris ticket
    due to Medicare negotiations regarding drug costs. Guess their money concerns
    won over cultural gender issues.

  content: Looking for info. I'm downstate NY, can get more specific in a dm. When
    I look up carpooling all I see are options to form one, nothing to join one. And
    all the bus trips I've seen seem to be on Saturdays which doesn't work, or aren't
    leaving from a  location near me.  Any suggestions? Also what's the closest point
    in Pa  to downstate NY where volunteers are needed most, in case  I look at whether
    I can just get there on my own. thanks

    voters after I take the Dials from Dawn 'til Dusk dialer training tomorrow evening.
    I know that we will be given a script in the dialer and that I will be able to
    answer questions about Harris-Walz, but shouldn't I also be prepared to answer
    questions about Bob Casey's campaign for US Senate? If so, are there some suggested
    talking points for Casey and his challenger Dave McCormick that I can review before
    I make calls in the next few days after training? Thank you!

    donated sandwiches and snacks. You could always email the person on the contact

    Is someone in here active (a previous commenter) on PA-related subreddits? We
    could use some help posting campaign-related news to those. We find all of the
    posts for you -- you don''t have to do any work besides posting a few articles
    here and there (depends on when there''s a rally or other event).'

    and in person) and I would love to help coordinate things. I'll let you know if
    I find anything concrete. I will say, I know a few groups that need drivers for
    a few people bussing in from NYC to canvass in Montgomery County AND that we could
    be driving people for early voting already.

    \ us.  Thanks for making efforts.   General population phone/text banking might\
    \ be great for you or canvassing.   And within that maybe certain types work best\
    \ for you (GOTV for known supporters\u2026 or what not).   Keep it up, when we\
    \ fight \u2026.\n\nI read further and see the feeling sick points you make\u2026\
    \ the reach app has tons of materials and I found it can be useful to read those\
    \ to help refine my understanding of campaign messaging on a broader set of topics.\
    \   I also used it to find folks that were (potentially) not registered that I\
    \ knew\u2026. Thus not hard sells on influencing their vote.  In the few detailed\
    \ conversations phonebanking being able to search the reach app sure helped me\
    \ speak better to specific concerns.\n\nIOW Can use the sick time to prepare to\
    \ succeed.  And try out tools/group-zoom-training  to hit the ground running when\
    \ voice recovers."

    \ \U0001F499 \U0001F54A\uFE0F  -- is there a Democrat-centered tutorial for Reach\
    \ I can peruse ? Or just in general ?  Need to understand it better.   I have\
    \ been ill all day -- it is almost certainly a transfer from someone staying at\
    \ my sister's house last week (current loc)  I will have to see how I feel in\
    \ the morning. \n\nThe texting training session seemed to flop unfortunately.\
    \  I received an email later on the evening asking for an indication on how I\
    \ felt it went -- but there never was any visible way to join the session in the\
    \ first place; doubtlessly I have missed a critical step and will need to try\
    \ again.\n\nI hope to be able to phone bank soon -- at the moment though my poor\
    \ throat is very upset with the world. \U0001FAE0  Is why I was attempting to\
    \ find the texting session. \n\nIf I could find accommodations in PA\nI think\
    \ that I could do well at canvassing, since I spent several years there, trying\
    \ to talk to various locals.  But the sickness , which could well be a covid variant\
    \ (another sister told me that a wave has hit \U0001F440 ) complicates there.\

  content: Days ago the Republican Jewish Coalition, which has an office in Philadelphia,
    shot a pro-Trump commercial in Hymie's Deli in Merion Station, Pennsylvania. The
    video now has over 132K views in just four days on YouTube. That the Republican
    Jewish Coalition is cheering while Donald Trump literally quotes Hitler is reprehensible.
    Pennsylvania's Jewish voters need to clearly understand that the White supremacy
    that Donald Trump praises and supports was the inspiration and playbook for Hitler's
    segregation, persecution and murder of Jewish people. White supremacy and Hitler
    are inextricably linked. Jews can't trust Trump. I hope the graphic I created
    in opposition to their messaging can be useful in convincing Jewish Pennsylvanians
    not to buy the spurious and dangerous fiction that a vote for Trump is in their
    best interest.

  content: Hi Gabby, Thank you for your question. I am Jewish as welI. I settled on
    this layout because a larger Star of David  draws your eye through the text all
    the way from antisemites to Trump. Additionally, the lines of text partially obscuring
    the Star of David, like  strands of barbed wire,  which echoes images of the Holocaust,
    make the visual point that Trump's actions endanger Jewish people.

  content: Hi <@353232795931508736> Thank you for joining us here! I can't help you
    with any information on local PA Dems but we could really use your help with phonebanking.
    It's something you can do from wherever you are from any time from 9 a.m. through
    to midnight every day. If you prefer to stick to a schedule, sign up for one of
    our regular phonebanks [**Phone Bank with Team Harris-Walz**](https://events.democrats.org/event/725393/?utm_source=Discord&utm_medium=Posts&utm_campaign=Daily%20Engagement

    \  Within mobilize the 2024pavictory group and Hadley ( https://www.mobilize.us/hadleyhaas2024/\

    \ region which I\u2019ve dropped food off to share in the past and suspect those\
    \ locations would be great places to pick folks up and take to the polls.  For\

    race in PA's 1st district that could use your help. Ashley Ehasz is running as
    a Democrat in PA-01 against the incumbent Brian Fitzpatrick. Now I live in PA-01
    and I can tell you that Fitzpatrick is a bit arrogant and claims to be an independent
    Republican but he really does side with MAGA on a lot of stuff. Anyway, the campagin
    has phone banks that are on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday. There's also phone
    banks all day on Election Day. I've been facilitating the Saturday ones and also
    I'll be facilitating them on Election Day. We use Scale to Win just like the Harris
    campaign and training is ALWAYS provided. Please sign up...she was so close to
    winning in 2022 and I feel we could get her elected in '24! https://www.mobilize.us/ehaszforcongress/event/709910/
