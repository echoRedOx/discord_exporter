  content: On mobilize.us you can sort using the filters. People sign up on the same
    site. Unfortunately, I don't know where there is just an appearance schedule for
    just the leaders.  I imagine that information is sparsed out for security concerns.
    I was responsible for George HW Bush's visit to Disney (yeah, LONG time ago) and
    I couldn't even tell my husband what I was doing.

  content: I signed up for the Vegas rally on Saturday because that's where I live
    they don't have the location or the time so I guess we wait till the last minute
    which is definitely understandable

  content: Awesome that ya'll are able to go to rallies in person. The locations have
    been last minute for security reasons. I would love to see more airport rallies,
    so cool when they pull up in a big plane.

    out to her local area democratic offices since this the tour says this stop will
