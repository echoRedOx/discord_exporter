I completed the google form and was onboarded. I had access to several text team channels within a couple of days from that date.  I did check in regularly for texting opportunities but they were always completed for the day.  I checked in this evening and no longer have access to all of the text team channels. I don’t know where or how to direct this question as it was removed from the text team welcome announcements channel. Appreciate any help.
