  content: Hi, I'm trying to be onboarded for texting. But it seems I made two Discord
    accounts. I thought I deleted one but it's still showing up. Is there any way
    to know that I deleted it correctly, and how to be properly onboarded on this
    accout which is the right one? The one that was created a few years ago is the
    correct one, and the one that was created today was by mistake.

  content: Hi <@684509183562743826> Disocrd says it takes 14 days to delete an account.
    I have some time later today to dig into this on zoom and get your number re-assigned
    to the correct account. If you don't have time today, and you can't wait 14 days
    for Discord to delete, there is one other work-around of using a family member's
    phone to verify today and then replacing it with your phone when the other account
    is deleted.
