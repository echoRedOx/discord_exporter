  content: "I had an elderly caller in Wisconsin who said she was not going to be\
    \ able to vote because she can\u2019t get around too well. She is a strong democrat\
    \ and would like to vote for straight Dem. I told her 10/31 was the last day to\
    \ request absentee. She does not have access to online resources to make the absentee\
    \ ballot request. I\u2019ve called both State and Local County Dem orgs to give\
    \ them her info, but they all are voicemails and answering machines (that\u2019\
    s a different problem in itself two weeks away from an election), but I need to\
    \ get someone her info that can help her request an absentee ballot. I have her\
    \ name and address, if a volunteer could possibly go help her, but I need someone\
    \ to contact to give it to. She lives in the Milwaukee suburbs, Brown Deer. This\
    \ should happen today."
