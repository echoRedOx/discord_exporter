Content: Hey fellow Utahns! I wanted to reach out to see if anyone here knows of any events or outreach efforts in southern Utah, especially Cedar City? Someone reached out on Facebook and said she worries she‚Äôs seeing more Trump-focused events and not enough of us Dems. I was just wondering if there was something I could send her way as far as volunteer opportunities (voter registration, canvassing neighborhoods, etc) go. And if anyone in here is working down in that area in that all. I‚Äôd just love any info if anyone has any. Thanks a bunch!

Content: Hey <@1289195233082343529> Sorry for the late reply, but I would say check out what has already been posted by people in your area on the usual sites (Tik Tok, Instagram etc). You want to make sure your site / post is different. Think about who is not represented in what you already see.  Since you posted in the state channel, I would imagine you want local youth.  My first thought would be colleges, including community colleges. However, for diversity sake (since not everyone attends college as a youth or at all),  go to coffee shops, gyms/ rec centers, media/gaming stores. These are places where younger folks are likely to work and hang out when not working. Write up a paper flyer to invite those whose voices are not already being heard to join in your channel post. Anyway, I hope this helps and good luck to you.

Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!
