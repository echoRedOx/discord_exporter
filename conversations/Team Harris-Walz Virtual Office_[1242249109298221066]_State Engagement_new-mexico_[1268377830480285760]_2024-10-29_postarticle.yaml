  content: I think it would help to develop positive specific messaging for Gabe Vasquez
    and Martin Heinrich to show they are better for New Mexicans than their opponents.  Any
    ideas from other NM folks here?  Messaging that canvassers can apply, or that
    we can use with our social media connections, letters to editors, etc.

  content: Lots of leftists in Northern NM are witholding their votes, spreading propoganda
    and intense antisemitism claiming to be pro palestine...make sure to have the
    difficult conversations with your friends and family. I've met people in Northern
    NM some are planning to vote third party or are so angry and misinformed they
    won't vote at all or talk to peers with similar views. its BAD. We have a serious
    housing and climate crisis in Northern NM. I have faced intense bigotry silence
    and hate when I try to get the vote out. It was nice to see Deb Haaland. She is
    a total disconnect to the folks in my community. The disrespect and obsession
    with the 1800s and covering up the history is very real where I am. New mexico..we
    are surrounded by red states with Trump abortion bans. Wake tf up.

    or not voting, they are honestly worse than MAGA. will lie to your face and turn
    on democracy out of hate.

  content: There's a lot of misinformation out there. While I wish Biden would withhold
    giving arms to Israel because Gaza is in dire need of humanitarian help as people
    are dying of starvation, we have to be pragmatic and know that Trump doesn't care
    about anything but himself, so not voting will not make things better in Palestine.
    I feel like Harris needs to speak to both Palestinians and Jews and give a more
    detailed response regarding what  to do if Netanyahu or Hamas don't agree to a
    ceasefire. Also, many of the pro-Palestine protestors don't realize that Hamas
    is also ruining Gaza as well. Many people in Gaza want Hamas to disappear.  There
    are too many extreme views on both sides, so we must figure out how to speak on
    this sensitive subject.

    wishes Netanyahu would wipe Gaza residents off the face of the earth. And then,
    'rebuild a tourist attraction'. So for the sake of capitalism and gain - run over
    "those people" .. the Doctrine of Discovery returns to the desert lands.

  content: 'Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House
    with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from
    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
    MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks
    is crucial.
