  content: "**Who are we calling?**\nPeople who we identified as voting for Biden\
    \ in 2020. So likely mostly Dems, some independents, and a few Republicans. \n\
    \n**The people I\u2019m calling are already voting for Kamala. How can I call\
    \ undecided voters?**\nIt's great that they\u2019re voting for Kamala. We\u2019\
    re calling all over the country! These conversations are still important even\
    \ if they\u2019re already a strong Harris supporter because they could join our\
    \ volunteer team!\n\n**Why do I keep calling the same person?**\nSame name, different\
    \ number, different person: Many of our lists are in alphabetical order by first\
    \ name, so you may call multiple \u201CDavid\u201Ds when they\u2019re actually\
    \ different people\nSame person, different number: Sometimes we have multiple\
    \ phone numbers for the same person. Just say \u201CSorry for calling again, we\
    \ had 2 numbers on file and wanted to make sure we were able to reach you!\u201D\
    \n\n**Where do I find information on the Senators we\u2019re calling about?**\n\
