I live in SC and only recently became aware of how many Democrats we have. I think many may be like me and just assumed we were outnumbered. I voted Republican for 5 decades almost exclusively. But after Trump, I will never vote for another Republican or anyone I know of Republican elected officials who have enabled him. I would love to find more voters like me and encourage them not only to vote for Harris -Walz, but to volunteer if they would like to. I  know I'm not the only one. Recently, some of us new and old Dems met up for breakfast at a local restaurant, wearing Harris tees, etc. Unheard of previously!! Thank you for this tip."
