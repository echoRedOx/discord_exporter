Content: <a:star_wave:1269735420359606369> Hey, Team! We know you want to help make a difference! Did you know though that hosting a debate watch party is an amazing way to get involved and bring people together? <a:rainbow_heart_scribble:1269029739432120465> It‚Äôs all about good vibes, great conversations, and getting folks fired up for the election. Your watch party could be the spark that motivates someone to vote! <a:PinkFlames:1252802562659193004>  [Register your watch party](https://events.democrats.org/c/host-a-debate-watch-party/event/create/) to get access to all sorts of resources for throwing a successful debate watch party, including a [Host Information Session](https://events.democrats.org/event/677337/). <a:ThanksRainbow:1278765693579431967>
