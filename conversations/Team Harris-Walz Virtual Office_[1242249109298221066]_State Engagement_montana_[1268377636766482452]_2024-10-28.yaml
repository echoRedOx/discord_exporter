  content: "Hello @MT, it is Sunday morning October 6th, and I am here with a  short,\
    \ friendly reminder that IF YOU DID NOT VOTE IN THE 2022 MID-TERM ELECTIONS IN\
    \ MONTANA, YOU ARE MOST LIKELY NO LONGER REGISTERED TO VOTE IN MONTANA. \n\nYou\
    \ can check your registration status at https://iwillvote.com/, and get the form\
    \ to register by mail, but YOUR APPLICATION TO REGISTER MUST BE POSTMARKED NO\
    \ LATER THAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 7TH TO COUNT. Bring it to a post office. Ask (politely)\
    \ to watch them postmark it if you try to mail it Monday. \n\nYou can also check\
    \ your registration status and download the forms you need to register at Montana\
    \ Secretary of State  Christi Jacobsen's official page, https://votemt.gov/ Same\
    \ due date applies. \n\n IF YOU MISS THE MONDAY DEADLINE, YOU CAN STILL OFFICIALLY\
    \ REGISTER AT ANY OF THE STATE'S 56 COUNTY ELECTION OFFICES UNTIL NOON THE DAY\
    \ BEFORE ELECTION DAY (you can also register on election day, but maybe don't\
    \ push your luck)\nHere is a link to the addresses of all 56 Election Offices\
    \ from Ms. Jacobsen's office: https://sosmt.gov/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?juwpfisadmin=false&action=wpfd&task=file.download&wpfd_category_id=23&wpfd_file_id=65879\n\
    \nOh  wait, no it is not. These are the addresses to mail your applications in\
    \ to. Most of them are PO boxes. It looks like most bigger towns have addresses\
    \ for actual offices where you can pick up and drop off your registration in person\
    \ - Helena has one, Missoula, Butte, even my birthplace Shelby is showing off\
    \ their big Toole energy with a real office, not just a PO box. But if you're\
    \ somewhere off in the boonies like Scobey or Billings or Great Falls, you might\
    \ want to fill out an application TODAY and  hit the post office first thing in\
    \ the morning tomorrow."

    input. We Montanans are passionate about our college football teams, and sometimes
    if a home has both Griz & Cat fans in it, it's "A House Divided." So it might
    be fun to bring Griz & Cats fans together for "A House Divided, United for Tester"
    virtual phonebank. Thoughts?

  content: 'Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House
    with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from
    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
    MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks
    is crucial.
