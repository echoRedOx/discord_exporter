Content: Is there a way to practice the dialer app without signing up for a calling session? i'm watching the 'scale to win training', and i'd like to practice what it is showing before actually doing it

Content: Replying as a fellow volunteer, not a mod. There is an option to choose Preview Script before you start calling. You can click on all the options just like when making a real call. This allows you to get familiar with the script for each situation and also the talking points before you call. I hope this was helpful.
