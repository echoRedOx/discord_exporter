  content: I keep getting this.. tried a bunch of different links and clearing my
    cache. Any ideas or should I just keep trying?

  content: <@936622618293968958> did it refresh once you backed out and clicked again?
    We just switched to WI, so that might have caused the glitch?

  content: <@936622618293968958> you may want to close out completely, toggle your
    internet connection off, wait a few minutes, toggle internet back on, then reconnect
    to the dialer. Which I know is basically a fancy way of saying...have you tried
    unplugging it and plugging it back in again. But actually disconnecting from my
    internet network and reconnecting has helped in certain situations.

  content: Sorry, I know this is frustrating. 2 things to try - first if you're on
    a Safari browser, try Chrome. second, see if going inconito fixes it.

  content: Thanks, Larry! I'll give that a go, cause I was still getting the error.
    Hopefully it's just me and not a bunch of callers.
