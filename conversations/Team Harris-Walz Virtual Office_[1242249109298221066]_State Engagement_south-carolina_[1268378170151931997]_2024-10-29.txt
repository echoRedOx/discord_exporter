Content: Hi all! I was born and raised in South Carolina and now living in Louisiana. I recently learned that Louisiana has more registered Democrats than Republicans! Decided to look up South Carolina's statistics and as of November 2023, voter registrations are neck and neck however Republicans have almost double the turnout!

Content: Very interested to see how to go about this. I live in SC and only recently became aware of how many Democrats we have. I think many may be like me and just assumed we were outnumbered. I voted Republican for 5 decades almost exclusively. But after Trump, I will never vote for another Republican or anyone I know of Republican elected officials who have enabled him. I would love to find more voters like me and encourage them not only to vote for Harris -Walz, but to volunteer if they would like to. I  know I'm not the only one. Recently, some of us new and old Dems met up for breakfast at a local restaurant, wearing Harris tees, etc. Unheard of previously!! Thank you for this tip.

After I'm down here, I go back to MD fired up - Maryland is a bubble but I go back knowing how much work has to be done in the rest of the country!!!!

Content: <@1267752019188514826>  for sure! I also finally got in touch with the person who is curating/ maintaining this list. So if your networks have other opportunities that aren't present here, I can connect them to get those events listed as well. The only ask is that ppl ensure the event isn't already here (which seems incredibly reasonable)

Content: On this day 4 years ago, a record 3.3 million Americans cast their ballot early.  And as expected, only 1.7 million early votes have been cast (a 45% decrease).  Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.
