Content: Lucky. Barry Moore is awful. My mother said he showed up at a funeral for the wife of a co-worker - unannounced and uninvited. He didn’t even *know* her. He was just there for publicity.

Content: Anyone using the Reach app have any luck finding anything to post that would deal with Southern issues like farming, infrastructure, etc? It’s kinda hard to find content that won’t immediately get swiped past to post. 

If anyone hasn’t had any luck with this type of content, I wish they would add something’s along those lines to help appeal to southern voters, especially Alabama.

Content: I think we have some good talking points for Alabamians. We know that Trump is not good for Alabama: for one, this trade war with China lowered the prices of our biggest crops (particularly cotton). He also not only didn’t do anything to help with our infrastructure, he actually deprioritized it.

Content: Yes, agree. I’ve been using memes from <#1265762143559618624> and also finding things from X. But yes, not much content for Alabamians in Reach.

As I understand it, this will entail an application process rather than training like some of the other initiatives and roles.

Content: It depends on what you mean by permission and by carrying out.  Individually we can engage in whatever political conversations we choose to.   The rub comes when it relates to these other activities being linked to the official campaign.  That’s what we want to avoid.  


Even if the mission of these other initiatives are essential and the talking points are solid; the campaign cannot take on liability for it.

To that end, references and discussions of external platforms like that can only reside at https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1268426751164551199 within this server so that there is a clear delineation.

I hope that helped answer your question, please let me know if it missed the mark.

Please let me know if you have any specific questions or areas of interest and I can point you to the right location or people to get you the information you need.

Content: Hello KC.  I think that may depend on what you mean by horrible social media posts.  If it is something that is egregiously false, defamatory, or misrepresenting the campaign I would recommend contacting the campaign directly for a timely action or response at https://democrats.org/contact-us/

If it is a matter of people broadly engaging in trolling posts you may ask the question here: https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1267941954243526756

Content: The non-official events, state, and news-conversation channels are the preferred channels; in that order, for down ballot discussions.  Avoid anything not directly related to the Harris-Walz campaign in the more general chat channels. 🙏🏾

Content: So... I had an interesting convo with Barry Moore. (Republican Congressman, District 1) Essentially, he told me he doesn't think abortion is healthcare, that people are being "killed by woke", and that kids are being pumped full of hormones that are giving them mental illnesses and destroying their bones (which he say, cannot be reversed. I'm assuming he's talking about gender affirming care. Also, this is not true. Some of it is fully reversible as I am aware. I'm no expert though and still researching for my video I'm making). He also told me that abortion clinics don't provide any other services (Which by that, I guess he's meaning Planned Parenthood?)

Just passing this along, since we've been talking about Alabama issues and he probably represents what people in the other camp really believe. I'm already making a video about this dude, and putting this convo with it. (Yes I have receipts, it was an email)

Content: Many people think its all the hormones in our food actually. That is actually true which is why I'm starting to watch my food.  What they don't get is that GMO isn't hormones it is a method to modify the actual food so that it has properties considered "good" for the product. That is a definite mixed bag of what is good and not good.  For example, our bananas are GMO - there is only ONE type of banana. Is that good - not really but it isn't bad for you to eat them. The reason it is bad is that if that variety ever developed something that killed them - it would kill them all.

Content: Ok, thanks for letting me know. For future reference, can links not have any “donate” button at all or is it restricted to DNC, Harris Victory Fund, and Harris for President? Because the link for the Rural Americans for Harris looked like it went to Harris for President. Thanks for any insight you can provide!

Content: This one is complicated. The page is non-official but the donate link does go to HFP so that's good, there is also a store link which goes to Nebraska Dem Party which isn't HFP. I'd say be cautious and do something like "ruralamericansforharris dot com"

Content: Are there any Alabamians here with high school seniors (or other high school students) in their lives? The Civics Center is offering a $150 gift card to students who hold a voter registration drive at their school (up to 3 per school). They have to do a one-hour video training course, register with The Civics Center, and report back. The Civics Center will provide materials to promote it, and the students do need a teacher sponsor. Here's a link with details: https://www.thecivicscenter.org/run-a-voter-registration-drive Share it with your community and schools, particularly in District 2!

Content: I lowkey wanna figure out a way to max out active progressive voters in these low voter turnout states like Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, etc.

The states in the top 10 of voter turnout in 2020 are blue states. The states in the bottom 10 are red states with the exception of New Mexico.

It’s like so many of us  are depressed and don’t vote and think we can’t get what we want for our state governments, but what if we actually can? What if we *can* have nice things?

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: Hey folks! Thank you for joining us. **Together, we will write the next chapter in the greatest story ever told.**

Phonebanking is our **number one priority** so close to the election, and it’s a phenomenal way to get started. We often set goals for specific numbers, like how we set a goal for 5 million calls this past weekend. We made 4.6 million, reaching immense numbers of people!

We’re 300,000 calls behind our goal for the day, and we urgently need to call Wisconsin voters. Early voting starts today in Wisconsin, and people need voting plans! We’re only **14 days away** from the election!

[Can we count on you to help us? Please, click here to get started and call directly into Wisconsin!](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=32641249-daa7-4253-b97b-df11f362bdb3&ref=go_kh_calls_wi&utm_source=hfp_w_go_calls_20241022&utm_campaign=hfp_w_go_mb_do_vol_vrec_calls_20241022&utm_medium=go_kh_calls_20241022&utm_term=go_kh_calls_20241022)

We know it’s scary for many of you. I have the same anxiety as well. But a second trump administration is much scarier. We can do this!
