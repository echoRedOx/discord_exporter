  content: hey folks! I am so excited to start hosting phone banks in person at my
    co-working space in Los Angeles. Is there a dialer bank or a best practice for
    getting the dialer links for these phone banks? Looking to host some on Sunday
    and on weekdays, would love WI, MI, PA, GA etc for weekend and AZ, NV for weekdays.

    on Discord, but it'd be great if I could direct other hosts somewhere to solve
    independently.)

  content: <@1287869697538129983> Thank you for hosting an in person phone bank. I
    am assuming you made it clear in your event description and title that the event
    was in person. I suspect that you are right about the misunderstanding. When you
    write the next description, think about in-person selling points (maybe snacks),
    supportive presence in the room and a small group of like minded people.  If this
    is at a private residence, be sure to hide the address, so it only goes out to
    those who register.  https://help.mobilize.us/en/articles/5857592-create-an-event-as-a-host

    to say "Hi I''m looking forward to seeing you tommorow".  That serves as a reminder
    and it''s makes them more accountable.  That will boost your attendance and give
    you a better idea who will be there.  This method has been proven over the years.  Good

  content: Thank you, <@936359743457464391> .  I don't even see an option on the Mobilize
    Dashboard menu to upload an email list.    I also have a follow up question.  I
    received an email with my sign up link to email to prospective invitees, but when
    i sent it to myself to make sure the link was working properly, I get an error
    msg saying "This event is no longer available."  Is that because the event is
    still awaiting approval?  If so, why would I get an event link if the event hasn't
    even been approved.  Apologies if this question has been answered previousl.  I
    am new to discord and not too familiar with how to search/use it.

  content: <@871529274975334431>  I have an event submitted (not sure if it is fully
    approved though).  And I even received my event link to share so I am unsure why
    you are not seeing that.  My event is called The Underground Railroad Cafe Harris
    Walz Phonebank.  see below.

  content: So Mobilize does not create the Zoom link for you, you have to set up a
    Zoom event personally then enter the link into the event to be sent prior to all
    attendees. For today's event, the best way to handle this is to create a Zoom
    event link yourself and send it to the 3 people who are registered. Then, for
    future events, we can have one of our team members add that zoom link to your
    events from the back end so it will work for all future events. (You'll want to
    make the Zoom link a recurring one at this time essentially, so this will work).

  content: Hi Felicity! Someone with permissions will come along soon I'm sure to
    help on this, but I believe these dialers are locked to everyone except HQ staff
    so that they don't get changed (they're used by a lot of people all day every
    day). I could be wrong, but that may be the case.
