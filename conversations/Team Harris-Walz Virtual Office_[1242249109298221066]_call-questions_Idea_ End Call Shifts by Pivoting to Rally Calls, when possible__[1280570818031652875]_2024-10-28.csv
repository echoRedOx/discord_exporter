The former have a higher rate of hang-ups and tough conversations, whereas the latter have a much lower rate of challenging interactions. 

Perhaps consider pivoting colld calls to rally support calls in the last 20 minutes to make calls more rewarding for volunteers. I'd happily explain the behavioral principles behind why this might help enhance the experience for phone bank volunteers (e.g., ending shifts on higher notes for more people, capitalizing on recency bias, etc.).

I don't know how hard that would be to implement. Just a thought."

Unfortunately, we pivot lists due to demand from our directors. We have a project manager who identifies where the need is for calls and as organizers we follow their instructions. I do recognize the behavioral dynamics of ending on a high, and will bring this up with my superiors to see how realistic this is."

Here are some ideas for discussing with leadership the idea of embracing the added challenge of ending shift calls, when possible, with 20 mins of rally support calls, which may leave volunteers on a positive note that may boost volunteer engagement and satisfaction, leading to:

- Increased retention: Volunteers are more likely to return if they have positive experiences.
- Improved morale: Ending on a high can combat burnout and create a sense of accomplishment.
- Enhanced productivity: Positive experiences can motivate volunteers to perform better during their shifts.
- Positive word-of-mouth: Satisfied volunteers are likelier to recommend the experience to others.

While the proposed change may add some complexity, the potential long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs. Happy volunteers are essential for a successful campaign, and this small adjustment may make a big difference. 

Thanks so much! Onward..."
