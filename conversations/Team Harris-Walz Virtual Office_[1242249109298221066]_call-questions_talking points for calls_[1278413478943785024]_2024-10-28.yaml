  content: Hi there, would it be possible to get updated talking points specifically
    for the economic policies that VP Harris has rolled out? I had a couple of undecided
    callers ask about grocery and gas prices and would like to be able to answer that
    question more eloquently. Thank you!!

    m on a call with a voter).  Thanks so much for checking!!"
