    for expanding to weekdays. I found that going up on weekdays you get women who
    are stay at home moms and far more likely to engage, because the husbands are
    out of the house.

    can tell you more about the postcard writing campaigns I've worked on.

  content: Hi Deborah, would you like to volunteer in person at all in New Hampshire?
    Or would you prefer to work remotely at home? You may want to look into the Voter
    Protection program (hotline & poll observation) for New Hampshire---let me know
    if you want me to link the info here. The voter hotline stuff is all remote at
    home. Also you can do phone banking from home (see link in previous post above),
    text banking, or sign up for a training to be a "chat" or "data" captain for the
    zoom phone banks with the distributed organizing team!

  content: Let me know if you need help locating any of the signup links again! We
    have text banking from home all day every day, zoom phone banks from home every
    day, DNC special projects/data entry training weekly, and and VOTE team trainings
    to help facilitate the zoom phone banks (including chat captain and data/tech
    captain if you don't want a speaking role)---I believe there is an info session
    for those roles on Sunday. We are fortunate that there is so much we can do remotely
    these days!

  content: Not with the campaign directly, no---they are focused on the battleground
    states. But MassDems is working with the coordinated campaign in New Hampshire.
    So if you prefer to volunteer closer to home while still making an impact in a
    less-blue state than MA, you can sign up for some of the local events here via
    MassDems or other volunteer groups that are hosting phone banks etc for NH! You
    can go to events.democrats.org and search for events near you by filtering for
    location...let me know if you need help

    If those times aren't available, I can try to make time for other hours. If this

    otherwise you cannot track donations. I find that the easiest thing to do is just
    give people the Act Blue links for the Harris/Walz campaign and then ask them
    to take a screen shot of the receipt and send it to you as the organizer so you
    can see the success of the event.

  content: "Welcome, Aafyre - the MassDems are prioritizing door knocking and phone\
    \ banking to NH. 25% of the door knocking volunteers are from MA, and they need\
    \ us.  The organizers in NH do a great job pairing up people who are new to Door\
    \ knocking or phone banking with proper training and - in the case of door knocking\
    \ - having a buddy. I love door knocking it gets me out into the communities and\
    \ learning about what matters to voters. My advice is if you are going to door\
    \ knock, find a location that works for you and go there regularly. You get to\
    \ build a relationshiop with the organizers and get to know the town/city, and\
    \ build a sense of comfort. \n\nThese are the Volunteer links I have gotten from\

    event, had a contact person and got connected through them.

  content: Hello. In previous campaigns I knocked on doors in NH (I'm in MA). I am
    doing the phonecalls, but I really enjoy connecting with the campaign in person.
    Unfortunately this year my leg is injured so I have limited mobility. Do you know
    if I could be of service in a campaign office, either in NH or MA? Happy to stuff
    envelopes, work on a computer, etc. Can you connect me with someone on the ground
    in NH, or with the Warren team in MA, to see if I can help? (also fine if that's
    more bother than help and I can stick to the phone calls from home).

  content: <@211694679870144512>  I think that depends on your time/abilities/interests...
    Do you have a personal connection to any of the swing states/districts? If so,
    that may make your efforts more meaningful to you. Some postcard campaigns supply
    the cards; others don't. Some campaigns supply cards that are mostly written --you
    add a sentence or two and postage; for others, you have to write the whole message.
    For the letters, you only add a sentence or two to a template--but you have to
    print out the letters. Basically, they're all pretty easy to do... but each one
    is a little different.

    vote?  A friend of mine is specially interested in volunteering in this capacity,
    and being in the Boston area, it seems particularly effective for us.

  content: "Spent the day door knocking in Windham / Salem, NH today. Some observations:\
    \ \n\n- We are still in voter identity time. This means we are looking for people\
    \ have been voters in the past and who were unaffiliated, or who have voted Democrat\
    \ in the past, but may not be diehard Dems. This is very common in NH. \n- There\
    \ were a lot of voters who were undecided. Speaking to voters is very important.\
    \ Marile was great at talking about Project 2025, I pushed that VP Harris was\
    \ in New Hampshire last week speaking about her Economic Plan and the local news\
    \ have done a great deal of coverage of the event. (Thankfully, NH has a lot of\
    \ very active local newspapers). \n- Yes, there were some Tr-mp supporters (mostly\
    \ men) who answered the door and wouldn't give the wives space to speak. There\
    \ were also men who just didn't answer the door, despite us seeing them inside.\
    \ Yes, I would rather speak to the obnoxious Tr-mp voter who literally shouted\
    \ at us. At least he told me who he was. He didn't intimidate me, and frankly,\
    \ he looked very small next to his big truck. \n- Favorite homes? The small family\
    \ farmer whose 4 people in the household would be supporting Kamala Harris ...\
    \ I picked up some local honey from her farm stand. And the woman who had just\
    \ come home from a vacation in the Poconos and was thrilled to see me with my\
    \ Kamala Harris and NH Democrats literature. \"Thank goodness you are here!\"\
    \ \n- It felt great to walk and knock. We need more door knockers. We are going\
    \ to be finishing Voter ID time and moving into persuasion time soon. And we need\
    \ YOU to knock knock knock."

    to help co-host a phone back at our election headquarters in NewBedford this Saturday
    so I've signed up for a Host training on Thursday, but will review and the info
    on phone-banking and try to get into a phone bank before hand so I'll have some
    first hand experience before training  our volunteers.

  content: <@663410272110772226> did you get the booklet in the mail with the questions
    and the yes/no statements? I know that's helped me a lot - I'm still undecided

  content: "What I\u2019ve heard from Simon Rosenberg (Hopium Chronicles) is that\
    \ the earlier we all vote the better. The main reasons: 1) the earlier we vote\
    \ the harder it will be for Trump to interfere with the results and 2) once we\
    \ vote our names are stricken from the rolls which frees up volunteer time and\
    \ effort so they can focus on those who need motivation to vote \n\nI\u2019m going\
    \ to vote the very first day possible. I\u2019ve seen photos of long lines because\
    \ people are so fired up to vote for Kamala \U0001F499\U0001F499\U0001F499 I don\u2019\
    t think we\u2019ll be missing out on anything if we vote early"

  content: Could any of my fellow MA Dems tell me more about this event (Bus trip
    to PA to canvas)? https://txt.democrats.org/nwqx I received a text invite yesterday
    and I'm tempted, but I also wonder if my energy might be better directed by continuing
    to phonebank and leave the trip to younger folks. Plus, I don't know how PA residents
    will respond to volunteers from out of state.

    part of this instead of not doing more and regretting it. Hopefully we get enough
    additional signups to make this happen.
