We have loads of material from trusted sources that you can printout and pass along to folks. You can find this in the Reach app library where you can use the Search function to get content for specific topics.

I just saw a great thread here called ""supporter content""  I assume that is for us to share on social media correct? I would like to share some that are in that thread on twitter.  How do I share it right from Discord to twitter?  Thanks.  (also if I have to go to the Reach app to share it, how would I find this content & also Reach app always freezes on my phone so it's hard to use)."
