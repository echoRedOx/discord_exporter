  content: "You can change your personal push notification settings for each category\
    \ (the top-level sections in the sidebar with carrots that look like this: > Community\
    \ >Level Up >Calls Team > Text Team, etc. \n\nTo change notifications, right click\
    \ (laptop) or tap and hold (mobile/tablet) the Category name. Click or tap \"\
    Mute Category\" and select your preferred option. For maximum quiet, select \"\
    Until I turn it back on\" or select your preferred option.\n\nNext, click or tap\
    \ \"Notification Settings\". You can turn all notifications OFF by clicking or\
    \ tapping \"Nothing\".  If you select @ mentions you will still receive push notifications\
    \ when you or your roles are mentioned/tagged. \n\nYou now have your preferred\
    \ notifications set for all channels in the category and you've muted the category.\
    \ \n\nThese settings can help manage overwhelm. \n\nYou can also right click or\
    \ press and hold a category, then select \"Mark as Read\" to dismiss bold channels\
    \ that show up when new messages are present. If you're still seeing channels\
    \ in bold, you can quiet them by muting the category or the specific channel.\
    \ \n\nLet us know if you have questions on these features!"
