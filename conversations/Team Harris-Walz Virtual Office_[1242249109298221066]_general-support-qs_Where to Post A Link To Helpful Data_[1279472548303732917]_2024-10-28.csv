All sources are cited and credible (ex-CDC studies; official gov’t docs). I imagine it’d be great for community notes people because you can copy/paste straight from the posts I write and link to the sources too. Also great for self education or in response to trolls. But I don’t want to post it in the wrong place! Just updated it today with more myth busting facts on the whole “born alive” debate. Link below for review; please let me know where it should go or if it’s not allowed.
