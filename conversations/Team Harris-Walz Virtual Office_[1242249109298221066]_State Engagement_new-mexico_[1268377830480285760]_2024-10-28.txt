Content: I think it would help to develop positive specific messaging for Gabe Vasquez and Martin Heinrich to show they are better for New Mexicans than their opponents.  Any ideas from other NM folks here?  Messaging that canvassers can apply, or that we can use with our social media connections, letters to editors, etc.

Content: Project 2025 specifically says it will cripple the 2 National Labs in NM, Sandia and Los Alamos.  I posted this on LinkedIn regarding that threat: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tim-buxton-719b416_climate-project2025-klimaschutz-activity-7224185578500603905-nTTQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

Content: Lots of leftists in Northern NM are witholding their votes, spreading propoganda and intense antisemitism claiming to be pro palestine...make sure to have the difficult conversations with your friends and family. I've met people in Northern NM some are planning to vote third party or are so angry and misinformed they won't vote at all or talk to peers with similar views. its BAD. We have a serious housing and climate crisis in Northern NM. I have faced intense bigotry silence and hate when I try to get the vote out. It was nice to see Deb Haaland. She is a total disconnect to the folks in my community. The disrespect and obsession with the 1800s and covering up the history is very real where I am. New mexico..we are surrounded by red states with Trump abortion bans. Wake tf up.

Content: I have never encountered as many openly proud racist weirdos as i have in northern NM. the south does not compare. If you know someone voting third party or not voting, they are honestly worse than MAGA. will lie to your face and turn on democracy out of hate.

Content: how petty and detrimental to democracy - Hamas and TRANCE2024 - Project2025 are one in the same. Withholding a vote to get "their way" is what authoritarian regimes do. Suerte without decision.

Content: There's a lot of misinformation out there. While I wish Biden would withhold giving arms to Israel because Gaza is in dire need of humanitarian help as people are dying of starvation, we have to be pragmatic and know that Trump doesn't care about anything but himself, so not voting will not make things better in Palestine. I feel like Harris needs to speak to both Palestinians and Jews and give a more detailed response regarding what  to do if Netanyahu or Hamas don't agree to a ceasefire. Also, many of the pro-Palestine protestors don't realize that Hamas is also ruining Gaza as well. Many people in Gaza want Hamas to disappear.  There are too many extreme views on both sides, so we must figure out how to speak on this sensitive subject.

Content: And, let's be clear .. Eric Trump has been concrete and outspoken. Trump wishes Netanyahu would wipe Gaza residents off the face of the earth. And then, 'rebuild a tourist attraction'. So for the sake of capitalism and gain - run over "those people" .. the Doctrine of Discovery returns to the desert lands.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!

Content: Perfect, thank you <@288902250955538432> I’m on mobile, probably why I’m missing it. Can’t find anywhere to mail my ballot. They took all the boxes away and the slot inside the post office is too small.

Content: No idea. Saw that on the news as well. I remember Rio Rancho hosted him for free, but ABQ did not. Good luck to anyone in the ABQ area for the upcoming traffic/logistical nightmare!

Content: I’m going to jump on calls RN to try and get ahead of the red wave he’s going to create (or hopefully he’ll just repeat his behavior @ MSG)…campaign should realize it’s been crickets over here for the Dem guest rally’s. NM is going to take note unfortunately. 

But to keep the drive going, we can all groove to this number, enjoy!
