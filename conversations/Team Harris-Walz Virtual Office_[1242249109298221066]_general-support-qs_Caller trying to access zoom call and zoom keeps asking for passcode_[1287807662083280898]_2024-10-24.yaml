  content: Caller is trying to join a phone bank.  They did not receive a confirmation
    email, and when they try to access the zoom link I provided, zoom keeps asking
    for an access code even though they are logged in to their zoom account, which
    has worked in the past.  I asked them to log in and out of zoom and that did not
    help.  What should they do?  How can I help?

  content: Thanks!  The caller has been so helpful in troubleshooting.  Other mods
    say you have to be logged in to your zoom account -- is this something we prefer
    but is not required?

  content: It really depends on what kind of zoom account the user already has. If
    it's a personal zoom account then logging in is fine. If it's a work account it
    could be asking to verify a zoom request from outside of the work  community.
