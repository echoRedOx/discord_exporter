It’s not my WiFi because that’s fast and fiber. Both are Mac/iOS and updated. I’ve tried in both safari and Firefox and the call software always craps out on the Mac. On a good day I might get a few calls to work on the pc but the software fail always kicks in eventually. 

I know they like us using a phone *and* laptop, but given my left arm is prosthetic (looks cool like a terminator, but much less dexterous) one device is better. My phone handles the call software just fine but trying to talk there and push buttons on the pc is rough."

In your next session, please ask a tech captain and I'm certain they'll be able to help out in a breakout room. Just explain the why as our default is to suggest the 2 devices for simplicity sake but I hope we're able to help you find a way to do it easily with just the 1 device!"
