As voting starts 9/6 in NC! postcarding starts to decrease in importance and direct voter contact with phone banks and canvassing increases in importance.  Have you considered maybe using a weekend to knock on doors in NV or AZ or for one of the critical congressional races?  But there are postcarding options still if that's what is best for you! https://www.fieldteam6.org/postcarding1  this one you do on your own.

Part of the challenge facing the media is that by fact checking Trump, it can make it appear as though these organizations are against him from the jump. Which can, in turn, give him further fuel to sow mistrust among his supporters and those who might remain on the fence.

It is a delicate line to walk."

During 2020, my first yard sign was stolen too, but I've since found that placing it closer to the house/farther up from the street is a good deterrent because people will think twice before walking all of the way up your lawn or driveway to steal it (and all the more so if they can see that there is a Ring camera to catch them!). üôÇ"

* CA-47: Min (D) vs Baugh (R). Katie Porter gave up this seat, so no incumbent, and a must-win seat for Democrats. 538 is favoring Min way too highly, the latest poll had Baugh up by 3 points and there has been almost 0 public polling. If you can help in Orange County, this is an important seat to win. 

* CA-45: Tran (D) vs Steel (R, incumbent): it‚Äôs a dead heat. This is one of the best chances to retake the seat after losing it in 2020.

* CA-41: Rollins (D) vs Calvert (R, Incumbent). Calvert remains up in the polls, but within margin of error.

* CA-27: Whitesides (D) vs Garcia (R, Incumbent). Whitesides is narrowly up. One of the best potential flips this cycle now that Christy Smith finally stopped running for (and losing) a very winnable seat.

* CA-22: Salas (D) vs Valadao (R, incumbent): basically a tie. Valadao won by ~3,000 votes in 2022. Can you help close the gap in 2024?

* CA-13: Gray (D) vs Duarte (R, Incumbent). Gray is up in the polls, but within margin of error. Duarte won reelection by 500 votes in 2022: can you help close the gap in 2024?"

She lost a Biden+12 (2020) district to Garcia in the 2020 special election, the 2020 general election, and the 2022 general election. Every time she lost, she blamed the Democratic Party for not helping her enough instead of acknowledging that she's just not very popular in her own district and not great at organizing.

Last weekend, I went on a bus trip over to **Yuma, Arizona** with a bunch of Obama alums to knock on doors and talk to voters for Kamala, Tim, and Ruben Gallego, who's in a neck and neck senate race against Kari Lake over in Arizona.

I'd thought to myself, ""what in the world are 15 volunteers going to do?"" Turns out we tripled the size of their office for a weekend and doubled their canvassing power. They were very, very happy to see us.

We had a woman who'd recently had an organ transplant hoofin' it in 103 degree heat because she wanted to make damn well sure that Arizona goes blue this year.

Well, **I'm going back.** I want a full bus this time, and so I'm asking my fellow Angelenos to **join me** on this trip. I'm going to drop the link for our trip right here:

https://events.democrats.org/event/724339/

We have a bus, we have lodging, we have sandwiches: **all we need are boots on the ground to rally our supporters!** Arizona's already started voting, so let's get moving!

If you have quick questions, give me a ping over Discord.

Best,

Anna Kim"

Last week, I and a dozen other volunteers went down to Yuma, Arizona, to knock on doors and canvass for Kamala and Tim. Many of us weren't sure we'd be going. The logistics were shaky, we weren't sure what the situation would look like on the ground, we had weekend plans...

...and we tossed all caution to the wind and rode off to Arizona in support of this campaign! The Yuma office was ecstatic to get our support, and are looking forward to our return this upcoming weekend.

We have a bus, we have accommodations, we have sandwiches, all we need now are more boots on the ground! Will you join us?

The sign up for this Los Angeles to Yuma trip is located here:

We leave tomorrow, so sign up quick. I look forward to meeting those who can answer the call!

I went with East Bay Knocks, leaving from Berkeley and organization was through the Harris/Walz Surge campaign and NV Dems.  I feel we made a difference, and it was pretty well organized considering how quickly this was put together.  The bus, hotel(single rooms) and breakfast and lunch were covered.  Buses went to Action Centers in different neighborhoods in Reno, mainly at private homes; I was a bus captain (I'm a phone banking coach here in SF and online with Bay Area Coalition) so we did training on the buses, and the training with the organizers on the ground in Reno was excellent and succint.  The script we received in advance was more of a voter ID script, confirming folks' support for Kamala & dems, or addressing undecided voters.  When we arrived in Reno, we were trained to do more of a GOTV ask: confirming voters' support and making voting plans with them.  So it was actually easier than expected.  How many doors answered and how many folks we had conversations with depended on the turf we were assigned.  I spoke with many more supporters and confirmed voting plans than doors shut on me:)  My partner and I had one woman chase us down after I left literature at her door after noticing a NO SOLICITING sign and left the house.  She chased us down to thank us for our work and ask some specific questions about the Dem slate there.  We provided voting information to several voters.  We saw no Trump Canvassers.  I urge you all to go in the next two weekends.  We need an army there to get out the vote."

You may not know the hotel location until the late afternoon but the campaign will come through.  We had 100 people pull up to the hotel in 3 buses, and the hotel had each of our names on a hotel key, we were checked in within 15 minutes with no signing or leaving credit card necessary.  Sunday morning you go right to an Action Center for 9 am shift, breakfast provided there (some folks got up early and bought a bigger breakfast at the hotel).

If you are familiar with the communications/media space, it is safe to say the Overton Window has been yoinked to the right.

That and being targeted by a person of that cluster of traits, including who he surrounds himself with, is business-ending and worse.

Folks are afraid to be targeted. I don't blame them; most folks don't survive that kind of onslaught unchanged. However, when enough folks stand up and push back, any impact can be absorbed and redirected."

Typically you have a thin amount of shared overhead space, less than an airplane, and often these buses have storage underneath for larger luggage. Reno should be like any mid-sized urban city and should have a lot of food options, though if the campaign prepares any bag lunches for people I wouldn't count on a lot of flexibility. I do know that the plan is for the buses to leave on time, so arrive well before 7 AM -- the DVC office will be open at that time for refreshments and restroom use."

Before you go:  download the MiniVan app.  It may be called MiniVan for business.  For on the bus:  make sure to close other apps on your phone to save batteries.  Bring an extra charged power bank (order from Amazon now if you don't have one) and charger wire with you on the trip and while you canvass.  Pack your overnight bag with nothing you need for during the day.  It will go under the bus and you will not see it until you check in to hotel in the early evening.  Bring your bag/backpack on the bus with:  water bottle, snacks(although some will be provided), hand wipes or sanitizer, sunscreen, a pen, anything else you need with you to be out all day.  Bringing an open ended tote for the campaign lit they will give you is super helpful.  I had a small backpack and a tote and I was glad.  Don't worry if you don't know what your hotel will be until you get there.  The campaign is coordinating for a lot of people.  We arrived at our hotel and key cards were waiting for us with each of our names, and it was super quick to check in close to 100 people(3 buses).  There were vegetarian sandwich choices at lunch and Sunday am bagels everything was veggie.  Make sure you have the Uber app on your phone because that is how we got to turf: the campaign provided vouchers for Ubers.  Search my previous post for more info or DM me with any further questions."

If you haven't already and if your local elections office has provided a phone number, give them a call in the morning and see if you can get through to a worker (that is, if they don't have a pre-recorded message about waiting times). This way, you might save on some gas and parking fees.

In the meantime, we have plenty of ways you can channel your enthusiasm into action. <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>"
