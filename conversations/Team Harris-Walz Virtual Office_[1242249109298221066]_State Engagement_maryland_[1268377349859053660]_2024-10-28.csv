Been making calls for Alsobrooks.  I am concerned that there have been no virtual events on Mobilize (that i have seen) to do any virtual calls or virtual textbanks for April McClain Delaney.  I receive email messages from her campaign stating how close the race between her and Republican Neil Parrot is for the House Seat.  I feel more online virtual events need to be done to get her elected!

I just got an invite from MD DEMS asking me to join the montgomery college rally. I msged the person back requesting they add virtual options for these rallies/speaking engagements for those who can't go out to events as well as adding textbanking for Delaney & phonebanking. they should do textbanking for Alsobrooks too! I hope he passes that request on. Mail in ballot voting will begin possibly 20th Sept- Oct 5th . maybe they are textbanking at in person locations or calling. idk. but there are none for supporters to do virtually for Delaney except one virtual phonebank I participated in & imo it was like Delaney was an afterthought as far as communicating it to voters. does anyone know when & how to watch Hogan alsobrooks debate & is there 1 for Delaney & Parrot.

I may try 2 keep an eye on which over the air shows what. like nbc has some against him. this morning my local ABC SINCLAIR affiliate had one against her. finally saw 1 against Hogan. have seen ZERO for Delaney at all & I don't think my dad has either.  but maybe they're targeting ads to more republican areas of the state? idk. I asked if he saw any for kamala. he said maybe a couple. ppl are voting here already mail in ballots. I wonder why barely any ads for harris? or...maybe targeting Republican areas...then again someone in neighborhood has parrot sign & previously had Trump sign so..

I did my best to do due diligence and then I did my ballot. but there is a HUGE PROBLEM. there isn't info on county or circuit court judges'  views.  general info on them & their general answers to unimportant questions does nothing. it's NUTS. it's like a secret. I hope ppl who are on a position do something about this so voters can be informed.we as voters are not informed or provided with info in order to vote on judges! I found it utterly unacceptable.

Phone banking is the single most effective thing we can do to get Kamala elected outside of knocking on doors. It's critical. We wouldn't be asking you to do it if there weren't a real, serious need to get people to call. I understand that chatting in a discord server is a lot more comfortable - and probably a lot more fun - and we really appreciate the community folks have built here, but at the end of the day, this server exists to steer people towards volunteerism. In this moment, with ten days left, that means calling. There are many, many other servers for political discourse. This one is for volunteering and for connecting people with volunteer positions."

Finally MD Dems seem to be tweeting about the school board candidates. Judges are hard-bluevoterguide does say who appointed them-my issue is-both Dem and GOP are recommending voting for all judges on BOTH their sample ballots.  I'm like, why? I did my best, hope Dems have advised well, but as i lamented in prior posts, we don't know about these judges' opinions on Pro-choice, medical aid in dying, democracy, so many issues etc.  Their interview answers tell you nothing as far as I'm concerned.  Dems/Independents really need to start informing US so we are knowledgeable about ppl whose positions last 10-15 year terms! It's nuts, imo not to inform voters.  Now that I am paying attention closely locally in this election, I became aware of this!"

In every campaign there are inaccuracies on both sides.  It's impossible to get everything 100% correct over a campaign cycle.  Even when you campaign with honest and noble intentions, mistakes happen. Facts and figures can be interpreted one way or another, and even accurate statements can be interpreted as lies under the right circumstances. Now add a 24x7 news cycle, pundits, podcasts, twitter, Facebook and everyone on the planet sharing their (usually dumbass) opinions all the time, yeah, it's really easy to get it in your head that everyone lies and there's no point in participating in government.  That, in a democracy, is simply not an option. Playing the ""bOtH sIdEs tHe SaMe"" card is lazy and counterproductive.  If you don't like either side, then it's your duty as a citizen to pick the side you like best, get involved, and work until you do like it. A democratic system of government was never designed for the citizenry to be hands off, but that's how we've come to treat it in the US.  So many people pay no attention and do nothing for 3.5 years, then moan and complain every general election cycle because they don't like the candidates or the party platform or whatever."
