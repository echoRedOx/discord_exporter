Content: Hi. I’m from Oregon and I’m wondering if I should offer to fly to Arizona to Canvas in person or if I should simply continue my digital outreach? What is better use of my time and money? I want to be put to use by the campaign. If go to AZ, who would I contact there? What are the steps? Not sure if this is the right place to ask this
