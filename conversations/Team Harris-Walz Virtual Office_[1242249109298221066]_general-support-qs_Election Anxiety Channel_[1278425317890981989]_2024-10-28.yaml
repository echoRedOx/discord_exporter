  content: Would it be a good idea to create a specific channel or designate a channel
    for everyone to collectively let out some of the angst they feel about this season
    whenever it bubbles up. Election anxiety is real and it could help talk about
    the real stakes people have with the election

  content: I understand the idea. But I urge **extreme caution**. I've seen channels
    in other servers centered around anxiety, and they each ended up reinforcing,
    strengthening, and spreading the anxiety everywhere. Basically formed a doom spiral.

  content: The linear "wall of text" that Discord creates can be anxiety inducing
    by itself. Specifically sectioning out mental health (creating a channel or even
    just searching for posts like it) can be extremely triggering if you don't have
    any mental conditioning against it (eg cognitive behavioral therapy).

  content: Well as someone who recovered from a significant mental health crisis in
    my life, I strongly oppose such a channel. It would only be mob group therapy,
    with so many people in it that the conversation wouldn't be able to be guided
    enough.

  content: Hi Anthony! I also understand the idea, but as this is the official campaign
    server, it is strictly for organizing, uplifting and supporting volunteers. We
    also have to consider the possibility that a channel like that could trigger or
    cause strong reactions in others. It would also be difficult to moderate, as we
    aren't professionals that could guide a channel like that to be a safe place for
    everyone.

  content: We appreciate the feedback! It is a very thoughtful and caring idea. Mental
    health issues are important and we want all of our volunteers to be safe. In these
    situations its best if individuals utilize local or therapeutic online resources.
    We have to err on the side of caution as we aren't qualified to give out any type
    of specific advice.
