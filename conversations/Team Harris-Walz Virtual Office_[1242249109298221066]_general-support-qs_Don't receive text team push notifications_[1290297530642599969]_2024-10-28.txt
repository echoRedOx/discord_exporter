Content: Hello <@1279970871162835079> you can change you Discord notifications for the whole text category or for individual channels. On the computer, right-click on the item you want to change and choose notifications and then choose all messages. These notifications will come to your phone. You can also change the settings on your phone by tapping on the item and then tapping "notification settings" and choosing all messages.
Let me know if you want to change the notifications from Spoke or Scale to Win.

Content: Thank you Carolyn. i had looked over my settings on  my phone after reading Lee's article above. Almost all seemed to be on.  after reading your instructions & helpful pic here, I changed the setting on laptop for text team announcements to "all." hopefully that will help.
