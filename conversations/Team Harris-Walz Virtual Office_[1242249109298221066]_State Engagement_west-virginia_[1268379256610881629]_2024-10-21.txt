Content: C'mon man...I have a very close friend in WV. Just wanted to help out here too. There is not even one. This is what happens to the red states every time. I understand the process. I get it. I will head to the swing states.

Content: Please keep an eye on the <#1242249109298221069> channel. They share daily social posts and events to join to get involved with the national campaign for harris. I encourage you to share on your social channels or text those links to any of your friends who you think would want to join. It is important that your friends in WV are seeing these posts. Even if at first they just scroll past, we need to help the computers notice that there is interest growing there.

Content: Am doing postcard outreach for OH and TX, but would also love to help do something in WV.  At some point, the Democratic Party needs to stop ignoring our state - we are fertile ground for Dem politics, but there is literally nowhere to get any info from anyone on volunteering in any way here.  It is a sad state of affairs in the Mountain State in terms of dem politics these days.

Content: I hear you, thats why I'm trying to start something here even tho I live in VA. Can you join me in identifying who else from WV is here and we can start making a plan. I'm currently reaching out to some friends and trying to see if I can find if there is anything at all going on that I can connect you to. I have been looking for about an hour and have not found anything. This means we may need to start with inviting people to join this virtual office. I can start reaching out to folks who are organizing in places close to WV, would you be able to invite other WV who would be receptive so we can have both a team coming in and a team to help meet people where they are. Ill go knocking on doors with you/whatever you think would be best received by folks who may not want to canvass but may be receptive to our message.

Content: Good News! Mike Pushkin is the Chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party and a Democratic member of the West Virginia House of Delegates representing District 37 since 2014. Update: The VA dems are finishing up a plan that rolls over from the work they were doing together at the DNC. I offered to start building up the volunteers here. They are just getting back from the conference and checking in with their families. We can expect a strategy roll out ASAP next week. Lets start inviting folks to join us here https://events.democrats.org/event/654007/

Content: Hello. Native of WV but living in Pittsburgh. There’s lots to do up here, obviously, but I’m trying to reach out in WV as well. I agree with your overall sentiment that nationally the Dems should stop ignoring WV. At the state level, I’m not sure what organization is like.     The recent Jim Justice news motivated me a lot, and I’m hopeful it may have changed some minds on him. I reached out to the Elliott campaign and am going to phone bank for him - they’ll welcome more help, FYI, if you’re interested.
