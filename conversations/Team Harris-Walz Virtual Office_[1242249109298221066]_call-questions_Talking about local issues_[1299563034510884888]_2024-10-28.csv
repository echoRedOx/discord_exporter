For example if I join now (8:30 pm MDT) it puts me in an Arizona phone bank, and the script talks about Ruben Gallego after some of the initial questions about Harris. I'm in Colorado, so I know nothing about his policies, and I think I would stumble/sound inauthentic if I tried to read the talking points on the fly. I am a hesitant to join this one, but I want to help."

The question is pretty simple - ""In the race for U.S. Senate, do you plan to vote for Ruben Gallego?"" Unless they are undecided, you can answer quickly and not talk about him specifically. 

If they are undecided, you can simply encourage the importance of voting for Democrats all the way down the ballot to support the work that the Harris/Walz administration wants to do.

You can also point them to his Gallego (Gah-yay-go) for Senate Issues page - I can't post the link because of campaign finance laws but you can find it quickly if you Google it. 

Making calls does so much that even if you don't have the background info to ""persuade"", you can give them some guidance."

First, no dem senate, no dem agenda getting passed. Second, go to the senate candidate's website, Debbie's in FL is succinct and clear on the front page."
