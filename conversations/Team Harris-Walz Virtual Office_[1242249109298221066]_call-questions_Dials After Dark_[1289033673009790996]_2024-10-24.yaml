  content: Not sure how to label this one - I called and two people were talking,
    one was very hostile/inebriated (I'll call him A) and the other one (B) was attempting
    to listen to me. However, after asking "Is this X?" B did not confirm yes or no,
    so I'm leaning towards A being the one I was supposed to call. A was being loud
    in the back/aggressive and I heard some things breaking so I thanked B for his
    time and hung up. Should I classify this as Refused/Hostile?
