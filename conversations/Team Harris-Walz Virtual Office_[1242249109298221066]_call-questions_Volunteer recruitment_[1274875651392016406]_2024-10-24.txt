Content: Can you share links to sign up to phone banks where you're just calling volunteers and not voters, e.g. recruiting people or confirming shifts?

Content: So unfortunately, our lists change based on what the campaign needs for the day, so sometimes its voter calls, sometimes its volunteer recruitment, etc. However, I am fairly sure (but not positive) that we will be continuing doing confirmation/recruitment calls to wisconsin voters asking them to attend the rally with VP Harris and Gov. Walz tomorrow, if you want to sign up for one of tomorrow's shifts.
