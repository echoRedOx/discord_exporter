Content: <@568257600228032512> Correct, but just to clarify, if they have not legally changed their name yet, is there anyway to note it in Reach, even if it does not change the official name, like a highlighted notes section.  If not, hope they add it.

Content: It is inside Reach. Dems would see if they are capturing info from Reach. You should ask the campaign if they are doing that. https://kamalaharris.com/contact-us/
