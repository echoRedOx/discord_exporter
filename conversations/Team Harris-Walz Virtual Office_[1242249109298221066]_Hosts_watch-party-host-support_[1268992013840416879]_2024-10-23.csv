I‚Äôm so glad to see you are persisting in the face of difficulties to get this watch party planned! The link that Rootsmusic sent is the same one I was sending, but I think perhaps the confusion might be because the form is already filled out with a basic template.  You are able to delete and edit the already filled out portions of the form. So, when you scroll down on that page just a little bit, under Basic Information you can see ‚ÄúEvent Title‚Äù and then a text box where the title ‚ÄúDebate Watch Party‚Äù is displayed. That text box, and all the other text boxes, are able to be edited. Let me know if that helps!"

‚ÄúThank you so much for requesting to host a Debate Watch party! It looks like you actually signed up via the national link, but as a Pennsylvanian, it would actually be so very appreciated if you could sign up for our state specific link.
Not to worry: we are coordinating with our national partners at the DNC and there won't be an expectation for you to host 2 parties or duplicate your efforts. 
Please sign up here at your earliest convenience, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions! 
Apologies for any inconvenience. ‚Äú
 
I replied telling them that even though I live in GA, my co host lives in VT and we are hosting it on TikTok like we did the 4 nights of the DNC & the Pres Debate. I didn‚Äôt hear anything until last week when they asked us to fill out the form for hosting (to get the campaign swag) I filled out 2 (1 for each of us) and the next day went to make a post with the link to register and it‚Äôs GONE! It‚Äôs now the day of the debate and I have no link and still can‚Äôt find it. Should we just run it on our own?
Thanks"
