Content: I wore my old school Kamala tee. My neighbor asked about it and I shared my enthusiasm for the campaign and some of the volunteer work I‚Äôve been doing and ways to get involved. I have found helpful resources on Reach  and supporter content. Thank you!

Content: I‚Äôve had several civil conversations with Republican friends and those waffling, who support or are leaning to Trump. They seem to be all ending the same way, which is that they see him as a means to an end and believe all of the rhetoric around Harris being a communist and business unfriendly. Some straight, simple content/facts to counter this would be great.

Content: I have been doing the grassroots ‚ÄúWoman to Woman‚Äù sticky notes in restrooms/baby changing stations here in Georgia. Your vote is private, vote for the girls in your life, etc. Been battling away on X an average of 12 hours a day (ü§™) amplifying the good stuff & spreading my own messages. If I haven‚Äôt been called a Communist at least once a day, I‚Äôm not doing all I can. I don‚Äôt engage with MAGAts, (especially those w/15 followers and don‚Äôt know the difference between your & you‚Äôre). I don‚Äôt want to amplify them. Tomorrow last day to register here in GA. Will be out spreading the word on that. Did a phone bank last week & will do more soon. Do we have pre-messaging ready for the more BS that will come w/Hurricane Milton? I usually keep my cool, but that misinformation narrative during the suffering, infuriates me

Content: COVID took me out of action most of September but I've been gently pushing back on them especially asking for sources/links.  Two nights ago I got a response "unlike these others, you know exactly what you're doing don't you?"  And last night admins of a local board blocked two comments of mine where I posted quotes and links to FEMAs disinformation page.  These may not seem like much but others are watching and noticing.

Around here, those are victories.

And this morning on an unexpected side of town TWO LARGE sets of HARRIS/ALLRED DISPLAYS.

Content: I‚Äôm struggling with so many shared Kamala messages being on X. I do not use X. I am on threads. Is there a way that people can quote Kamala without X?

I‚Äôve had good response by finding out what matters to a person and then letting them know what‚Äôs happening in politics around the matter. One young woman was pregnant and she wasn‚Äôt registered to vote. She said she didn‚Äôt know who to vote for. I asked her what she cared about and she said she didn‚Äôt know. So, I started with well you are a woman. There are some important women‚Äôs issues on the ballot. I told her about the $6,000 for new parents that Kamala has in her economic plan and then mentioned the abortion issue and getting healthcare for pregnant women. She registered to vote while we were talking.

Content: For some reason, people don't understand that the economy is doing really well - so critical with 30 days left.  Do we have detailed short and sweet bullet points? Really short..people are burning out.

Content: Its good Harris is presenting an economic plan but its good to also factcheck on the economy. Steve Rattner showed some great charts on Morning Joe on Friday that could be used: https://youtu.be/Z3d_OCqgAaM?si=NvptYTYd3OgpCSYs Charts: https://x.com/SteveRattner

Content: Hi Traci, thanks for flagging that. The campaign doesn't have any jurisdiction over that directly, but I will mention this so they can route the note properly or provide feedback on how you can.
