  content: I'm at the top of the REACH Ladder because my goal is to personally connect
    with every one of my 5000 linkedin and FB friends and ASK them to engage the campaign
    and if possible, use REACH.  I know most of these folks personally after being
    on these platforms since their inception.  My tactic is to personally message
    people and respond to every positive response I get to confirm their VOTE and
    use their networks through REACH or other.  So far, I'm meeting with excellent
    success.  About 1 in 5 contacts results in a "conversation" (back and forth messaging
    in which I can identify the voter and determine further volunteer work).  I have
    made approximately 1500 personal contacts thus far resulting in over 300 "conversations."  About
    1/3 of these said they download or consider downloading REACH.

  content: My strategy is to create "conversations" and to move my friends into action.  When
    I post anything, I'm adding an invitation to engage the campaign through REACH
    (on FB, Linkedin, or x or my various email groups - of which I have over 30.  If
    I get a like or a comment or a share, I respond to that person and try to create
    a conversation via message (it works more often when you're obviously dealing
    with a responder who shares your values).  I've created new connections in this
    manner and have access to a larger and larger group of confirmed supporters.

  content: I'm developing a list of things I do daily (eg, wish friends a happy birthday
    on FB and ASK them to engage the campaign; respond to commenters; message friends,
    etc.) to create "conversations" and move people into action.

  content: I'm hosting a Whiskey Sip n Share for Kamala and Tim on 9/6.  Open House
    from 5-9p with whiskies from around the world.  I'll use my email and phone contacts
    to nail down 15 hosts at $100-250 and then we'll recruit from there.  Goal is
    $5K but I'm hoping for closer to $10K.  I will use my email invitations (over
    400) to encourage people to download and use REACH for their relational organizing
    in the digital sphere.
