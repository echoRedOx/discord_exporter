  content: 'Hi -- Here is a message I just posted to the twitter-community-notes group.
    Am open to your ideas --Dan Hi  - Thanks for bringing up the Musk-Trump conversation.
    I am resending below my message on this topic. I am attaching information on several
    areas they might talk about and post: DEI, anti-Trans etc. Some statements are
    already in CN form. Please message everyone if you use any, so we don''t duplicate.
    I will be focusing on various aspects of immigration, which are not in the attached
    document. I doubt CNs can work on lifestream and we''ll need to look for posting
    within minutes of a statement. I heard Trump was not actually back on X --- Dan                         Hi
    Folks - Elon Musk will be interviewing Donald Trump tomorrow evening [Monday}
    at 8 ET/5 PT on X-Twitter. I will look in real-time for video clips on Elon''s
    account, RNC Research, MAGA War Room & others. For responding, I am preparing
    or recycling community notes in areas where Musk & Trump align in bashing: trans
    rights, DEI, immigrants, mainstream media, etc. I will post draft community notes
    in a document here before the interview. I can only post one CN a day so you are
    welcome to borrow some of mine if you want to join in this effort. I''ll focus
    on responses to immigration falsehoods.  Elon has 190 million followers so this
    could be bigger than most TV events'

  content: Thanks for this article. I've often wondered if Musk would allow a community
    note on one of his posts. Last week he did ask community note contributors if
    something was valid. One of his supporters who responded now has a CN attached
    to his post -- one that I helped promote. I am focusing now on commenting on  https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom
    and https://x.com/RNCResearch  which have clips of the conversation. I can only
    do one CN a day and will do one on their falsehoods about crime and immigration
