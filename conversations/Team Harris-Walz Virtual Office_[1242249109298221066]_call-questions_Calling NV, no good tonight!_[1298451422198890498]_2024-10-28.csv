Thanks for joining us tonight, and sorry you had a less than stelar experience! A lot of these lists can be tough, but that's how we will win---combing through these difficult lists and finding the diamonds in the rough who we can persuade. But, even if you're getting wrong numbers, this is still a big help! You are helping to clean up our call lists so that we won't have to waste any more time trying to connect with those people when it matters the most during the final stretch of GOTV! No one should be rude to you, but if they are, always please feel free to politely end the call immediately, mark ""hostile"" (which also removes them from our list!), and move on! Thanks again for being here---you're making a big difference, even though sometimes it can be difficult to see that in the moment ðŸ™‚"

I see you over in the audio channel, but unfortunately I don't have permissions to speak over there for some reason. Just wanted to make sure you don't need anything else at the moment, let us know!"

Discord is...not super user friendly! Are you able to see the channel that just says calls-team? Try clicking here <#1242256751445934262> and drop us a note in there! That's where we chat while we're making calls!"

It wasn't really a call, it's more of a waiting room type area where we can see that you're in there, and theoretically we can go in there and speak to you via voice/audio...although it doesn't seem to work for everyone. Anyhow give us a holler over in the other channel if you need some moral support as we get through these tough calls!"
