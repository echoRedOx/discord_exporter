  content: 'I am a FB Mod for Texas. Update: I found out belatedly the press release
    about RFK Jr from the campaign is a real press release. It just seemed odd to
    mention RFK Jr, although the message to voters is important. My question still
    stands that it would be great to have a press releases tab on the campaign site
    or a separate channel here.  Thanks again, Jay E  - PS: I did check and double
    check the campaign social channel, which I love as it is a great summary.  However,
    I did not find any post about the press release.'

  content: My suggestion (and I am sure this is in the works) is to provide something
    similiar to what is done on the administration site.  Having a web browser version
    and summaries within social media help sites like this one would be awesome.  Thanks
    again for reading this.

  content: hmmmm that is basically what our <#1268690577960992878> and <#1252676126698897429>
    are for. Of course not everything is going to be posted, but most relevant stuff
    will show up in one channel or another
