You were correct to not choose one of the options on the survey. This person will most certainly be getting a followup call to make sure they make that voting plan! If you get another one of these, definitely give them the info (verbally) on the righthand side of the script page about voting dates, polling hours, deadlines, along with the voter hotline number and iwillvote.com/nv so they have all the resources available to decide how they want to cast their ballot!"
