Content: Hello, I'm a data analyst/engineer/scientist.  I applied for a paid job with the DNC along with about 100,000 others, apparently.  Is there any work in data analysis the campaign needs?

Content: Hi <@1281046487962488996> it sounds like you have some valuable experience. The volunteer activities here are all about connecting with voters in phonebanks, text banks, hosting parties, etc. The phonebanks have data captains who are part of each session, if you are interested in that role you can ask in ⁠calls-team.
