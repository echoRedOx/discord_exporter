Content: I‚Äôm excited to help but want to make sure I‚Äôm remembering all the things I signed up to do. An option to see them all in one place would be super helpful.

Content: I can't find it on Reach, however if you log onto https://www.mobilize.us/me/settings/ with the same user you have on Reach, you can see all the events you signed up for in your schedule in the menu on the upper-right

Content: Right after I get emailed the details for events I‚Äôve signed up for, I save them to my phone‚Äôs reminders app (or calendar if you prefer). That way you create a concise ‚Äúone stop shop‚Äù and can avoid all the back and forth between browser, inbox, texts‚Ä¶ just thought I‚Äôd share since it‚Äôs one less thing to worry about when scheduling for more events. Also helps me avoid double booking by accident or messing up the time zones. <:bidenpointq:1251648410902069351> üòÅ
