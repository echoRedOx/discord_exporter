Iowa has two options:
1. In person: Visit your local polling place any time starting ***today***, October 16th! ([This site](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterreg/pollingplace/search.aspx) can show your polling place.)
2. By mail: Request a mail ballot by 5 PM on October 21st. Then mail it so it arrives by 8 PM on November 5th, or drop it off in person at the county auditor.

There's also lots more information [right here](https://iwillvote.com/votinginfo/IA)."

If you're already registered to vote, you can still use your driver's license if it's been expired for *90 days or less*.

If it's been expired longer, there are other options like a passport or a ""voter ID"", which you can get from the county.
