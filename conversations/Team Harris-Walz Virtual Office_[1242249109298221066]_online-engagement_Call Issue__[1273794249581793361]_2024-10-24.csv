Thank you for reaching out to me. ðŸ˜Š I was in the Women for Harris-Waltz Pre-Convention Call. It was scheduled for 8pm but I was still waiting for it to load. Both the YouTube live stream link and the Zoom call were delayed and once they loaded it was five-ten minutes until I had sound.

Is there another Party Host Information Session coming up? I missed the one last night but I'd like to host a watch party."
