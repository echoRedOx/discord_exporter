  content: Yes absolutely! You can go to events.democrats.org and filter using the
    "near" field and type in whatever city/town you're interested in going to, and
    you'll find a list of events you can sign up for there. You can also filter by
    "type" and select canvasses. To find official campaign events only, you can filter
    by organization (2024 NV Victory or Arizona Democrats - Jumpstart AZ). Let me
    know if you need help.

  content: 'I don''t know of any organized groups doing bus trips from CA so far.
    In the meantime, I would recommend signing up for one of the canvassing events
    in an area of a swing state you''re interested in going to, and once you RSVP
    you will get contact info and maybe you can reach out to them and ask if they
    know of any CA groups organizing transport or housing. Where were you hoping to
    go to? Las Vegas has some canvassing events specific to out-of-staters: https://events.democrats.org/event/670562/'

  content: I get it. As voting starts 9/6 in NC! postcarding starts to decrease in
    importance and direct voter contact with phone banks and canvassing increases
    in importance.  Have you considered maybe using a weekend to knock on doors in
    NV or AZ or for one of the critical congressional races?  But there are postcarding
    options still if that's what is best for you! https://www.fieldteam6.org/postcarding1  this
    one you do on your own.  There's also the CA Democratic party website list of
    events - just search for San Francisco. https://www.mobilize.us/cadems/?address=San%20Francisco%2C%20CA%2C%20USA&lat=37.7749295&lon=-122.4194155

    friends I typically only see in passing.

  content: Hey <@433096446028283905> the text team has been revamping some things
    so they paused trainings but should be getting back up and running. You might
    look into other opportunities through the <#1268398483841220649> channel and keep
    an eye out for when the Vote Team posts that texting is offering new training
    sessions.

  content: If any of you are interested in CA specific races - I just joined Team
    Gavin Newsome and though texting is paused for the weekend, looks like there will
    be texting on the 3rd for some state races. The good thing is they are on discord
    so if you are already here, you already have an account - it's the same account
    - you will just have different teams. Watch the videos, take the quiz and if you
    pass you can join. I understand there is texting every day. I don't know much
    about what races they engage on, but I see other states as well, not just CA.

    weeks. I can't use my Google Voice for this but other people have had good luck.
    I've done three days of the bigger texting efforts and those have been very smooth.
    I'm signed up for a few of the "text arcades" this month - which I think is really
    the same as the bigger texting efforts, but you donate to get a list. They do
    a good job and their Slack is really active

  content: 'The Overton Window has definitely shifted to the political right.


    Part of the challenge facing the media is that by fact checking Trump, it can
    make it appear as though these organizations are against him from the jump. Which
    can, in turn, give him further fuel to sow mistrust among his supporters and those
    who might remain on the fence.


    It is a delicate line to walk.'

  content: Yes, and, those followers are fully entrenched in their mistrust of any
    source not part of the Trump propaganda machine, so the efforts to appear "fair"
    just skew everything right and wind up alienating moderate consumers who then
    disconnect and wind up getting their information from admittedly left sources
    like podcasts and websites. It pushes us all into the echochambers. I don't know
    what the solution is, but the current options aren't it.

    I filtered by Watch Party and San Francisco, but you can put in your zip to get
    more specific. Or people can post others in this channel and in <#1268426751164551199>.
    The search function may also bring up more. Or YOU can host your own!! https://events.democrats.org/c/host-a-debate-watch-party/event/create/?event_creation_source=discovery_page_no_commit

    win this November, but it won't do any good unless it gets read!  I don't write
    a whole lot, so I don't have many followers or anything like that.  I just found
    all this information and compiled it in a way that I thought people would find
    inspiring and approachable.  Can I get some help to promote this?  I'm hoping
    if people read it it will bring in money and volunteers for the campaigns.  https://medium.com/@peterst28/getting-democrats-elected-when-we-fight-we-win-11f92f57af40

    The lowest-price tickets are four-figures. I believe I can post the info here
    because it's HVF, but will wait till a moderator greenlights. Meantime, happy

  content: Yes! We can get you hooked up over there. You can go to [events.democrats.org
    and ](https://events.democrats.org/) and select "filters" at the top. Then under
    the "campaign or organization" field, select "Arizona Democrats - Jumpstart AZ."
    If you start typing "az" in that field it will pop up. Click on that org, then
    hit the blue "apply filters" button. It will pull up a list of all of their events---you
    can also filter by "canvass" under tags, although sometimes that filters out things
    that shouldn't be filtered out.

  content: <@1276944250491113656> It was amazing!!!! So much collective, positive
    energy there! The local NV Dems were out in full force to get out the vote, promote
    local ballot initiatives, and recruit more volunteers, which was so awesome to
    see, and there were people dancing and cheering almost the entire time leading
    up to the speeches! Super kid-friendly too.  And everybody was so nice to each
    other, even when it came time to exit the parking garage afterwards, lol. They
    had 3 NV members of congress and both NV US senators speak before VP Harris, and
    we were able to get close enough to actually see her pretty well without the Jumbotron!
    It was a crazy long day (didn't get back to SD til 3 am!) but my 12 year old son
    held up well and said afterwards that he was really glad we were able to be there.
    I'll post a couple of pics from my phone in a sec.

    \ 6 races where you can tip the scales:\n\n* CA-47: Min (D) vs Baugh (R). Katie\
    \ Porter gave up this seat, so no incumbent, and a must-win seat for Democrats.\
    \ 538 is favoring Min way too highly, the latest poll had Baugh up by 3 points\
    \ and there has been almost 0 public polling. If you can help in Orange County,\
    \ this is an important seat to win. \n\n* CA-45: Tran (D) vs Steel (R, incumbent):\
    \ it\u2019s a dead heat. This is one of the best chances to retake the seat after\
    \ losing it in 2020.\n\n* CA-41: Rollins (D) vs Calvert (R, Incumbent). Calvert\
    \ remains up in the polls, but within margin of error.\n\n* CA-27: Whitesides\
    \ (D) vs Garcia (R, Incumbent). Whitesides is narrowly up. One of the best potential\
    \ flips this cycle now that Christy Smith finally stopped running for (and losing)\
    \ a very winnable seat.\n\n* CA-22: Salas (D) vs Valadao (R, incumbent): basically\
    \ a tie. Valadao won by ~3,000 votes in 2022. Can you help close the gap in 2024?\n\
    \n* CA-13: Gray (D) vs Duarte (R, Incumbent). Gray is up in the polls, but within\

  content: 'WIth the caveat that this channel should mostly focus on unity & positive
    organizing efforts: Smith  isn''t a team player and was never able to form a strong
    campaign apparatus. She lost a Biden+12 (2020) district to Garcia in the 2020
    special election, the 2020 general election, and the 2022 general election. Every
    time she lost, she blamed the Democratic Party for not helping her enough instead
    of acknowledging that she''s just not very popular in her own district and not
    great at organizing. Policy goals are important, but so is pragmatism -- can''t
    enact major policy if you''re not in the House Majority.'

    for security reasons.  This is the best channel to ask about local or state wide
    events.  Just curious, do you have time to do some phone banking? We have many
    flexible options. Also, online engagement is a great option too.

  content: '**Hey Los Angeles!**


    Last weekend, I went on a bus trip over to **Yuma, Arizona** with a bunch of Obama
    alums to knock on doors and talk to voters for Kamala, Tim, and Ruben Gallego,
    who''s in a neck and neck senate race against Kari Lake over in Arizona.


    I''d thought to myself, "what in the world are 15 volunteers going to do?" Turns
    out we tripled the size of their office for a weekend and doubled their canvassing
    power. They were very, very happy to see us.


    We had a woman who''d recently had an organ transplant hoofin'' it in 103 degree
    heat because she wanted to make damn well sure that Arizona goes blue this year.


    Well, **I''m going back.** I want a full bus this time, and so I''m asking my
    fellow Angelenos to **join me** on this trip. I''m going to drop the link for
    our trip right here:


    https://events.democrats.org/event/724339/


    We have a bus, we have lodging, we have sandwiches: **all we need are boots on
    the ground to rally our supporters!** Arizona''s already started voting, so let''s
    get moving!


    If you have quick questions, give me a ping over Discord.


    Best,


    Anna Kim'

    12pm - 9pm PDT - I reached out to the organizer via email once I got a confirmation
    (you will have an option to contact organizer) as I plan to drive which is going
    to be 8-9 hours for me... Have you RSVP'd yet? You should do so regardless if
    you can attend or not - you can always cancel later if you do not attend. I know
    from experience they really keep the time slot sort of open ended and do not announce
    location until day before.

    Last week, I and a dozen other volunteers went down to Yuma, Arizona, to knock
    on doors and canvass for Kamala and Tim. Many of us weren''t sure we''d be going.
    The logistics were shaky, we weren''t sure what the situation would look like
    on the ground, we had weekend plans...


    ...and we tossed all caution to the wind and rode off to Arizona in support of
    this campaign! The Yuma office was ecstatic to get our support, and are looking
    forward to our return this upcoming weekend.


    We have a bus, we have accommodations, we have sandwiches, all we need now are
    more boots on the ground! Will you join us?


    The sign up for this Los Angeles to Yuma trip is located here:

    https://events.democrats.org/event/724339/


    We leave tomorrow, so sign up quick. I look forward to meeting those who can answer
    the call!


    Best,


    Anna K'

    be able to organize. Who can I DM or talk to about how this works? We have a lot

    with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from
    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
    MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks

  content: 'Hi Bruce, and @everyone, I just got back from a weekend in Reno.  I went
    with East Bay Knocks, leaving from Berkeley and organization was through the Harris/Walz
    Surge campaign and NV Dems.  I feel we made a difference, and it was pretty well
    organized considering how quickly this was put together.  The bus, hotel(single
    rooms) and breakfast and lunch were covered.  Buses went to Action Centers in
    different neighborhoods in Reno, mainly at private homes; I was a bus captain
    (I''m a phone banking coach here in SF and online with Bay Area Coalition) so
    we did training on the buses, and the training with the organizers on the ground
    in Reno was excellent and succint.  The script we received in advance was more
    of a voter ID script, confirming folks'' support for Kamala & dems, or addressing
    undecided voters.  When we arrived in Reno, we were trained to do more of a GOTV
    ask: confirming voters'' support and making voting plans with them.  So it was
    actually easier than expected.  How many doors answered and how many folks we
    had conversations with depended on the turf we were assigned.  I spoke with many
    more supporters and confirmed voting plans than doors shut on me:)  My partner
    and I had one woman chase us down after I left literature at her door after noticing
    a NO SOLICITING sign and left the house.  She chased us down to thank us for our
    work and ask some specific questions about the Dem slate there.  We provided voting
    information to several voters.  We saw no Trump Canvassers.  I urge you all to
    go in the next two weekends.  We need an army there to get out the vote.'

  content: 'Regarding rooming:  you will put your overnight bags under the bus until
    the evening, and keep the bag with what you need for canvassing (water, snacks,
    extra power supply for your phone etc.).  You may not know the hotel location
    until the late afternoon but the campaign will come through.  We had 100 people
    pull up to the hotel in 3 buses, and the hotel had each of our names on a hotel
    key, we were checked in within 15 minutes with no signing or leaving credit card
    necessary.  Sunday morning you go right to an Action Center for 9 am shift, breakfast
    provided there (some folks got up early and bought a bigger breakfast at the hotel).  I
    HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS EXPERIENCE-- KAMALA NEEDS YOU OUT AT THE DOORS IN SWING
    STATES.  Please feel free to reply with any questions you have.'

  content: 'Hi Sai, I did this trip last weekend.  Before you go:  download the MiniVan
    app.  It may be called MiniVan for business.  For on the bus:  make sure to close
    other apps on your phone to save batteries.  Bring an extra charged power bank
    (order from Amazon now if you don''t have one) and charger wire with you on the
    trip and while you canvass.  Pack your overnight bag with nothing you need for
    during the day.  It will go under the bus and you will not see it until you check
    in to hotel in the early evening.  Bring your bag/backpack on the bus with:  water
    bottle, snacks(although some will be provided), hand wipes or sanitizer, sunscreen,
    a pen, anything else you need with you to be out all day.  Bringing an open ended
    tote for the campaign lit they will give you is super helpful.  I had a small
    backpack and a tote and I was glad.  Don''t worry if you don''t know what your
    hotel will be until you get there.  The campaign is coordinating for a lot of
    people.  We arrived at our hotel and key cards were waiting for us with each of
    our names, and it was super quick to check in close to 100 people(3 buses).  There
    were vegetarian sandwich choices at lunch and Sunday am bagels everything was
    veggie.  Make sure you have the Uber app on your phone because that is how we
    got to turf: the campaign provided vouchers for Ubers.  Search my previous post
    for more info or DM me with any further questions.'

    canvassing is?  I've signed up to be there Nov 2-5 with NV Victory/NV Dems and
    need to book a hotel, but the event doesn't specify location.  I found the NV
    Dems headquarters (on Paseo del Prado) but not sure if that's where I should try
    to stay near?  Thank you!

  content: <@&1245910179975921795> Early voting has started in many of the swing states,
    so this weekend is CRITICAL to our GOTV efforts. It's also incredibly important
    that we make sure that people with mail in ballots have gotten their ballots and
    understand how to return them. This is such important work, and we have to close
    strong. But we can't make our 10 million call goal without your help. If you're
    experienced, you can go straight to our dialer [here ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=933f666e-c699-46e3-ac92-12d9cf6f3992)
    - if you're new, please join us over in <#1242256751445934262> to get connected
    to some training! (If you don't have that, go to  <id:customize>  and choose "talk
    to voters in key states.") Even making a few calls helps. Many hands make light
    work. Will you please come over and join us?

  content: MAGA discovered our print shop and original Harris for President shirts
    and hats a few weeks ago. Yesterday they showed up in force with cars draped with
    Trump flag, blaring loud music as they passed our shop. This continued for a couple
    of hours as they circled the block and turned up the noise level as they approached.
    They finally got bored and left about 4:30.

  content: Yeah it's annoying, but as I told customers- "Let em have their fun". They
    only have a few days left to be hopeful. Nov 6 they will be in deep despair. Then
    they will become dangerous. My shop is in Old Sacramento and a neighboring business
    did call the police and was told the MAGAs were within their rights. We know the
    noise ordinances, because we get lots of offenders here. This group was definitely
    violating the peace. Next time we'll go to the shift supervisor. I'm quite sure
    they will be back.

  content: Hi friends in <@&1245910179975921795> , good afternoon! I am here to see
    if folks in here might be willing to come to <#1242256751445934262> (if you don't
    have this channel, please go to <id:customize> and add 'talk to voters in key
    states'!) and help us make some calls. I'm so sorry to hear about all the horrible
    voter intimidation tactics you're dealing with. The only way past this awfulness
    is to have someone in the White House who wants to turn down the temperature on
    this hateful rhetoric, and in order to do that, we have to get Kamala elected.
    This is the moment to make calls. If you can't help today, it would be amazing
    if you could look at your schedule and block out some time in the coming week.
    We are getting SO close and GOTV is going to be so critical. (If you're experienced
    and want to head straight to the dialer... [right here](https://go.kamalaharris.com/dial/national?ref=natl_dis_host_discordveveryoneelse)

    If you haven''t already and if your local elections office has provided a phone
    number, give them a call in the morning and see if you can get through to a worker
    (that is, if they don''t have a pre-recorded message about waiting times). This
    way, you might save on some gas and parking fees.


    In the meantime, we have plenty of ways you can channel your enthusiasm into action.

    have a robust phone banking set up with coaches to train you.  Please bring a
    laptop or iPad.  We are open every day from 10 am-8pm every day through November
    5.  Also if you are an experienced phone bank coach in the area, send me a DM
    and I will connect you to the phone bank supervisor.
