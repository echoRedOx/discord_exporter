Am I missing it? Thankfully they were already aware of getting in touch with their municipal clerk's office and could have a friend help them complete their ballot, but please advise how we should handle this and other disability access needs on a call in the future."

You had the right instinct about their local clerk's office but anything you're not able to speak to iwillvote.com & the hotline are the resources that will best assist them!"

I did refer them to the iwillvote.com website as well but I didnâ€™t feel confident that their question would be answered. It would be nice if the website mentioned anything about disability access (even just a mention and note to call the hotline). Many disabled people feel like they are on their own and donâ€™t know that they have options. Good to know the hotline will be prepared.
