  content: Thanks, Will! I'm making good progress pulling folks together with a semblance
    of a video content plan so can provide an update on Monday.  In the meantime,
    do you know if there is an existing library of all Harris, Walz, and ideally also
    Trump, Vance climate and energy related very short video clips that our team of
    editors/producers could access? If not, is that a project that could make sense
    for a climate volunteer to work with the broader campaign digital team to create?
    Seeing how fast they are cranking out other stitched video content (not climate
    related), I would think there's an existing workflow there that we may leverage...
    LMK if this is better for email. Thank you!

    \"When some turn a blind eye to justice, and bury their heads in the sand;\nWe\
    \ could squander this opportunity don't let it slip through our hands.\nNow I'm\
    \ feeling a sea change upon us, I ask is it pre-ordained?\nIf we don't take action\
    \ and face all the facts, we could be forever changed.\nCHORUS\nWe can\_stand\
    \ together,\_Give our future this\_chance,.\nWill we welcome a new world just\
    \ and fair, where do you stand.\nWe can\_stand for freedom, for everyone in the\
    \ land.\nOur Children will carry that mantle if given the chance.\nNow some say\
    \ it's part of a cycle, some say it's part of a scheme;\nSome say it's fate now\
    \ old mother nature is coming apart at the seams.\nNow most of us want all the\
    \ same things, a world without bias and strife.\nThe same opportunity once and\
    \ for all is every American's right.\nCHORUS\nWe can\_stand together,\_Give our\
    \ future this\_chance,.\nWill we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you\
    \ stand.\nWe can\_stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.\nOur children will\
    \ carry that mantle if given the chance.\nSo go blame society,\_go say your piece\
    \ and cherish your deep held beliefs.\nAnd all that had mattered got all torn\
    \ and tattered, history always repeats.\nWhen some turn a blind eye to justice\
    \ and then quote scripture and verse;\nWhen hypocrisy rules we call out the fools\
    \ and we all take a turn for the worse.\nWe can\_stand together,\_Give our future\
    \ this\_chance;\_\nWould we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you stand?\n\
    We can\_stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.\nOur children will carry\
    \ that mantle if given the chance.\nWe can\_stand together\_we can strengthen\
    \ the ties.\nWe can't let this new found common ground get tossed by the wayside.\n\
    We can\_stand for freedom. We can\_stand for freedom.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/vEKRsmhsu8E"
