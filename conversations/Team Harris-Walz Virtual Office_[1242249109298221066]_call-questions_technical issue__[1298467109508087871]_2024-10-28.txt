Content: I just reached someone who I could hear clearly at first, but then after I asked who she was supporting, there was just silence, which kind of dragged on until I ended the call. Is that  a busy/callback? Does this ever happen with the dialer, that the connection just goes silent?

Content: It sounds like maybe she didn't want to answer and put the phone down, I would mark it as a refused.
