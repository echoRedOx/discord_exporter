  content: Hi, I wanted to ask about the feasibility of using the dialer on an unstable
    internet connection. I used to have no problems, but have now been forced to move
    the router in my home so my PC occasionally disconnects from WiFi. I don't think
    I can do any more phonebanking using my computer's audio, but it is possible to
    still use my phone for audio while my PC is connected to the dialer? Or will a
    drop in WiFi still cause my calls to disconnect? I'm so sorry about all this.

  content: OK, good to know. I'll try another phonebank soon and see how it goes.
    It stinks because I like phonebanking and feel like I'm doing something good,
    but now I'm worried I'd do more harm than good if I disconnect in the middle of
    calls.

  content: My phone has never once disconnected in the middle of a call. I hope that
    makes you more confident about phone banking!
