    group. (I'm new to Discord, so I don't know whether we're in a "group", "channel",
    or something else.) You asked for suggestions for our Rules; I'd like to suggest
    that we consider using our nine Text Team Rules either verbatim or as a guideline.
    I'd be happy to share them with you, if you'd like. Again, thanks for your initiative,
    energy, and dedication.

  content: 'As text team members, we will:


    1. Show kindness and respect to staff, fellow volunteers, supporters, and every
    person you message. We are committed to creating a safe and welcoming experience
    for every member of our community. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.


    2. Assume best intentions, keeping in mind that digital communication erases gesture,
    voice, and other helpful forms of context. Remember, we can''t know what people
    are going through. Avoid responding in the heat of the moment.


    3. Acknowledge the time and experiences shared with us by everyone we meet, no
    matter their political views. Our texts may be the only interaction a voter has
    with the campaign. Thank them for taking the time to talk to us and let them know
    we appreciate hearing their input.


    4. Represent the Democratic Party positively, honestly, and accurately. We never
    support a negative premise, make endorsements or value judgments, draw on unapproved
    source material, put words in a candidate or elected official''s mouth, soften
    or change policy to appease a voter, or engage in arguments.


    5. Respect each other''s privacy. Absolutely no: sharing screenshots outside of
    our workspace or exposing personal details about voters. Do not share personal
    information without express consent.


    6. Follow through on commitments to the responsibilities we take on with this
    team, and communicate if we need to step back or if something comes up.


    7. Before deciding to send a batch of texts, be sure you can send all the initial
    messages you claim within thirty minutes of doing so and are available to handle
    your replies for at least an hour. Be mindful of your availability before making
    that commitment. If something changes, let a moderator know.


    8. Sending messages is just the beginning with texting - it''s important to make
    sure the voters who choose to reply to us are receiving prompt, thoughtful responses.
    Each night, we ask you release all your texts at the end of your shift.'

  content: "ACTION NEEDED! Purdue Update: The Lafayette team is crunching the numbers.\
    \ They had 7268 voters at the campus polling places in 2008. The current early\
    \ voting plan is 4 hours of early voting with 15 machines which only serves about\
    \ 900 voters. AND NO ELECTION DAY VOTING!\n\nThey have had on campus election\
    \ day voting for EVERY election since 2007 including the May primary. Suddenly\
    \ the three person election board has deemed these same locations problematic.\
    \ \n\nPurdue\u2019s campus is nearly 2500 acres. Most residence halls are on the\
    \ west side. The proposed off campus location is east of campus - a 30 minute\
    \ walk from most of the dorms. Freshman are not allowed cars on campus. And November\
    \ weather is very unpredictable. Plus, they still have classes that day.\n\nThese\
    \ 6000 plus disenfranchised young voters are worth fighting for. These votes affect\
    \ ALL of our state and ALL of our country. Send emails BEFORE the Sept 27 meeting.\n\

    \nCopy them all so they can\u2019t claim \u201Cfailed transmission.\u201D\n\n\
    Sample Message\n\nI urge Purdue University to appeal the Tippecanoe Election Board\u2019\
    s Sept 27 decision to offer no election day voting on campus based on \u201Cfailed\
    \ transmission.\u201D The Greater Lafayette republicans, the Greater Lafayette\
    \ democrats, and the Greater Lafayette League of Women are all in agreement that\
    \ this plan is inadequate. The Purdue Student Government is also on record that\
    \ they need on campus election day voting. Please do not wait until your polling\
    \ places are overwhelmed to find out that this plan will not accommodate the 7000\
    \ likely campus voters.\n\nQuestion the numbers put forth in the part time employee\u2019\
    s powerpoint. They don\u2019t add up. Since Tippecanoe county does not have precinct\
    \ voting, anyone in the county can vote on campus.\n\n2008: 3,475 on Election\
    \ Day (Purdue Memorial Union); 3,793 early (two days at Stewart Center\n\nYour\
    \ current plan only allows for 1000 on campus voters. That leaves 6000 plus disenfranchised\
    \ young people. Do the right thing! Appeal this decision. Protect your reputation.\
    \ You are a research institution. Do the research!\n\nAppeal the Sept 27 election\
    \ board decision based on failed transmission NOW!"
