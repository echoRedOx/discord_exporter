  content: I just finished a shift welcoming folks to Team Harris and encouraging
    volunteering. Spoke with guy who already volunteers for Democrats but shared feedback
    that he feels that some donation messaging is "tricky" because of the recurring
    donation language. He mentioned a few times about how that feels dishonest. Not
    sure if anyone has been getting this feedback, but wanted to share in case there's
    a place for it higher up.
