I have my first virtual phone banking session this evening (yay!), which is supposed to provide brief training and a script during the meeting. Will this training/script include advice re: how to talk to potential voters about policies, if I'm asked? If a potential voter asks me a question I don't know how to answer, how do I respond? I trust the provided resources will be helpful, but I would like to be prepared so I can best support  this campaign! Thank you!"
