Content: I have a question.  So I am all about the spirit of keeping it positive, right?  But I am seeing posts on fringe social media that are blantantly false.  (Not talking about twitter/X).  Is there channel that it is appropriate to post those for the effort to combat misinformation?  Again, I am not talking about ⁠twitter-community-notes

Content: Hi Steven, I appreciate what you're asking. There isn't a channel for this, and I'm not sure how we could do it and avoid confusing some folks. And there's potential for someone here to share it somewhere else in ways that might be damaging. But we'll think about it.

Content: I appreciate your response Carolyn.  Many of the folks from the places wher this information is coming from (right biased social media) that see this misinformation are not going to vote for Dems anyways, but there is always hope that some folks could change their minds and in such a close election, I feel my talents would be useful for getting the word out.  Obviously there are unaffiliated  channels like social media, etc.  And, I am hoping to understand how the campaign is doing fight this battle and how I might help with.

Content: In 2020 I was a full time volunteer staff member in the Biden campaign as a researcher in the field of misinformation. Please send me a friend request here on Discord and feel free to send me information and I can get it to the right places.

Content: Also to the admins here: Perhaps you could start a misinformation hashtag  channel here where people can report misinformation.  After 4 years of combatting misinfrmation, much of it already has been identified, but it's good to have a reporting system so that the people who have algorithms and network analysis can have the data.

Content: I don't think that misinformation should be made into memes. However, correct information should be made into images and memes. There is another DNC based group here on Discord that is specifically taksed with creating images.

Content: At this time, there are organizations dedicated to addressing some specific forms of misinformation. In order to spread accurate information on voter suppression, for example, look at Rick Hasen's websites and twitter X pages, media interviews, media, etc. He and other scholars of election law have a blog called Election Law Blog.  Rick Hasen is nationally the best expert.

Content: There is also a website called White House Briefing room which contains more details than anyone could ever read on any program or policy from the Biden administration.

Content: Hello <@1246966565623173134> you are doing great work here. And you are right we have a wonderful Content Brigade that creates images forwarding the messaging of correct information. I had suggested the meme-vault because that spaces is especially for sharing things found "in the wild". 
I'll talk to staff about misinformation channel and see what they think. I am wondering how to confirm the validity of items posted as misinformation.

Content: > images forwarding the messaging of correct information.

The problem is: Meta's platforms are blocking Reach's factual content.  The campaign is aware of this problem, but there's no workaround (to get Reach's content around Meta's flagging process).  So the OE Team has been finding *the process* difficult to amplify factual messaging to other Meta users.

Content: So I think if a channel was created it would allow for the posting of true, unbiased information.  I like the idea of it!

Content: Hi <@456226577798135808> we don't have the capacity to support a channel for this right now. There are other orgs doing the work of combatting and collecting data.
