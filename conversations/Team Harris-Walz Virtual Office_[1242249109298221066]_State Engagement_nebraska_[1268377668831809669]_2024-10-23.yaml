  content: "FYI <#1268377668831809669> The election is mere weeks away, and vast amounts\
    \ of pressure is now on Nebraska lawmakers to change the game\u2019s rules before\
    \ it even begins. So let\u2019s call this exactly what it is: a brazen attempt\
    \ at a power grab by special interests, outsiders, and politicians who want to\
    \ get their way at all costs \u2013 even if it means removing a powerful Nebraska\
    \ legacy. \n\nRemember: How Nebraska awards its electoral votes sets our state\
    \ apart and unites us. While most other states give all their electoral college\
    \ votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state, in Nebraska,\
    \ we can allocate our votes by congressional district. This is a Nebraska tradition\
    \ because of our deeply nonpartisan heritage that promotes fair representation\
    \ and boosts participation on Election Day.\n\nNebraska\u2019s split electoral\
    \ vote system has worked for over 30 years, ensuring fair representation for all\
    \ voters. Returning to a winner-take-all approach would ignore Nebraska\u2019\
    s diverse voices and political landscape. Our current system ensures that urban\
    \ and rural areas are represented fairly, fosters greater voter engagement, and\
    \ prevents any one party from monopolizing our state\u2019s electoral votes. This\
    \ system has given Nebraska unique influence on the national stage, and there\u2019\
    s no valid reason to abandon a method that empowers all voters and preserves fairness."

  content: Nebraska friends, especially those who live in the second congressional
    district.  PLEASE call your governor and your state senator and tell them to OPPOSE
    the push by Trump and MAGA Republicans to steal an electoral college vote.  This
    essential electoral college vote could hypothetically win us The White House,
    or throw the whole country into chaos.  Which is exactly what they want.  And
    as a bonus, you also have an abortion measure.  Please use the link below to see
    all the upcoming deadlines and important information!  https://www.vote411.org/

  content: 'Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House
    with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from
    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
    MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks
    is crucial.
