    I recently learned that Louisiana has more registered Democrats than Republicans!
    Decided to look up South Carolina's statistics and as of November 2023, voter
    registrations are neck and neck however Republicans have almost double the turnout!

  content: Very interested to see how to go about this. I live in SC and only recently
    became aware of how many Democrats we have. I think many may be like me and just
    assumed we were outnumbered. I voted Republican for 5 decades almost exclusively.
    But after Trump, I will never vote for another Republican or anyone I know of
    Republican elected officials who have enabled him. I would love to find more voters
    like me and encourage them not only to vote for Harris -Walz, but to volunteer
    if they would like to. I  know I'm not the only one. Recently, some of us new
    and old Dems met up for breakfast at a local restaurant, wearing Harris tees,
    etc. Unheard of previously!! Thank you for this tip.

  content: <@1267752019188514826>  for sure! I also finally got in touch with the
    person who is curating/ maintaining this list. So if your networks have other
    opportunities that aren't present here, I can connect them to get those events
    listed as well. The only ask is that ppl ensure the event isn't already here (which
    seems incredibly reasonable)

    with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from
    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
    MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks
    is crucial.
