  content: 'Is there an appropriate place to discuss the contours of botting and/or
    rapid response from MAGA?


    Ex: I''m pretty sure they are specifically flooding the "news" section on the
    home page of YouTube with frankly weird lies (comments/upvotes) and brigade-downvoting
    pro-Kamala people who come into that space.


    Idea: We could deploy some kind of resource to combat this with similar tactics
    or advise people on how to avoid engaging, etc.'

  content: Not really. Would require some serious expertise and resources. Maybe beyond
    scope of campaign. Definitely beyond random volunteer to figure out. XD
