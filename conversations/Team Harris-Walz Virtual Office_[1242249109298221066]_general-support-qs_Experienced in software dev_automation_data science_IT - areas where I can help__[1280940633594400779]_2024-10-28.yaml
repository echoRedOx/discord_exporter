  content: Hi - I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, CA. I've done phone banking once
    and happy to help in whatever way I can.    I am wondering if somebody can direct
    me to the right contact.  I have a lot of IT/Software Engineering background.   I
    run a small company and am very skilled at Data Analytics/ and general process
    automation.   I'm not looking for a fulltime job but happy to volunteer to help
    streamline operations, data management/analytics and help with anything data/software
    related, where I can probably help create more impact..   Most of the listings
    in the main Kamala Harris website seem to be fulltime roles,  which don't work
    for me.   I'm looking for part-time, volunteer type projects to help with...

  content: Hi <@1280765333002518591> sounds like you have some valuable experience.
    The volunteer activities here are all about connecting with voters in phonebanks,
    text banks, hosting parties, etc. The phonebanks have data captains who are part
    of each session, if you are interested in that role you can ask in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1242256751445934262
    . More advanced data analytics would be a full time job at campaign HQ https://kamalaharris.com/work-with-us/
