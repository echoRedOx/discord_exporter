Content: Hi <@727597685292400662>. Thanks for sharing and volunteering. When we get back to using Reach even more frequently, there are ways to share feedback there on the actual images within the app. Look for the little "thumbs up" or thumbs down image to help report how that content did with your audience. Another place you can share feedback in Reach is in "My Sharing History" within the Library. You can press the little "give feedback" megaphone next to each image or video that you shared on each particular social network to let us know how it did. This is all voluntary and the feedback is not mandatory. If you're open to doing it I suggest doing so when the reaction is extreme - positive or negative. Thanks again for being here with us. I hope this helps.
