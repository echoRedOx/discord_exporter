    the email went to     info@contact.kamalaharris.org


    Can someone inform the right team that this is happening?'

  content: The email I received shows that it was from contact@e.kamalaharris.com.
    When I replied to it, it shows that it went to     info@contact.kamalaharris.org,
    which is different from the email address it came from. All I did was hit Reply,
    so I'm not sure why it defaulted to a different email address, but I imagine this
    is happening to everyone.

  content: Oh I see. It is likely that the contact@e.kamalaharris.com email can send
    out emails but the inbox can't receive replies, and the original senders changed
    the reply-to email so they could see the replies that came in from that feedback
    request. I hope that helps clear things up!
