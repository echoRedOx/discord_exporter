Content: Hi, I'm a 70 y/o psychologist in CA.  I've canvassed locally many times...but don't we need people to reach out to voters (especially older voters) Face-to-Face in battle ground states?  I would be willing to travel to do so.  Are there volunteer groups for this purpose?  Thanks

Content: try searching events.democrats.org for opportunities. Also look at the Democratic parties for battleground states and our <#1268426751164551199> thread here on the server. Hope that helped, Dr. B!

Content: Hi Dr. B. I found https://www.mobilize.us/ to be very helpful in finding ways to help in key states. You can filter by state, city, etc. I live in New York City but found ways to help in Pennsylvania.
