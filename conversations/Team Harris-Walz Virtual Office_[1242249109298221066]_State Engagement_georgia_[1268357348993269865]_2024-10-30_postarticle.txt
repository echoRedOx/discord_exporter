Cobb Co was 56% for Biden in 2020, which was a flip. I'm in the same Co as <@733789896422195262> but a different city. Cobb is pretty big.

Content: Hello Georgia!! I was wondering if there are any initiatives happening in Georgia with college students- specifically with registering students to vote (for those who can claim residency) and/or targeting Georgia students attending college out of state with how to request absentee ballots? That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd really like to volunteer my time!

Content: We don‚Äôt really need volunteers but you could easily replicate our event. Being the government librarian for an FDLP library, I have to host a Constitution Day celebration (all public educational institutions have to technically but our college is REALLY into it) so i contacted the e League of Women voters and they‚Äôre helping us run a voter registration table in the library. They‚Äôre really fantastic and bring tons of voter information. We worked with them for the midterms and it was a great turn out. Our SGA also is doing something but I don‚Äôt remember what their event is doing.

I have commented on this post and hoping other Georgians will join me and expressing opinions on the election issues in our state. I asked all my friends and relatives to post as well. They need to be reminded that we are watching.

Content: <@733789896422195262> unfortunately, strict campaign finance laws prohibit us from posting any links to sites that solicit funds outside of the official Harris/ Walz fundraising channels. Feel free to post any Mobilize links for volunteer efforts for the candidate (as long as there are no links to donate or to a store) or to post information about where ppl can go to see the candidates speak, etc. Thanks for understanding!

Content: I wanted to share this event that takes place every Friday at 2pm EST, from now until Oct 25, over Google Meet. It's quite enjoyable to listen and become well-informed about VP Harris' track record and accomplishments! It truly feels like a chat among old friends while taking some time to highlight the best attributes about our next President! <:kamalaharris:1269013846564012083> <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> The host, Klaudette, is beyond exceptional in gathering the info for every session (each one touches on different topics) so I hope some of you might end up joining us! I've found that the insight I gain from these calls, I'll often bring up in casual conversations and during phone banks! It would be an absolute delight to see if we can increase our audience for today, even if it's just one more person! Hope to see you there! ü§† <:blobcheer:1278915863491383377>  https://www.mobilize.us/2024gavictory/event/672900/

Content: I listen to Politically Georgia on NPR almost daily. Today they discussed the State Board of Elections stuff with Brad Raffensburger. It was good to hear him express confidence in the county officials and the Georgia voting process, but it is concerning how much chaos those rules could have if they are allowed to stand. Sec. Raffensburger did say the newest rules would not stand up in court, but it‚Äôs so close to the election they are going to have their intended purpose which is to cause confusion and distrust.

Content: I'm a CA resident that is interested in moving to GA for the final month of the campaign to help organize. I can pay my own way to get to wherever I will be most helpful to the campaign, but I was hoping there might be another volunteer or member of the campaign that has a spare room that I could stay at while I volunteer. Please let me know (in DMs) if anyone can help connect me with the right person!

Content: Hi Georgia friends.  This November you have the ultimate opportunity to troll MAG republicans.  Not only did they require all in person ballots to be hand counted, but they also required mail in ballots to be counted faster.  The more mail in ballots you submit, the fewer in person ballots.  You've already requested 161k (3% of 2020), so dont delay, make a plan to vote today! https://www.vote411.org/georgia

Content: I don‚Äôt understand the point you are trying to make about trolling MAGA‚Ä¶ I would think that a better strategy than swamping the system with mail-in ballots would be to take advantage of early voting and vote early in person October 15 to November 1.

Content: Phone bank has had a number of folks knowing they have.  My little calling today is +16-30% in favor of Harris with some increased turn-out of registrations.

Got some nice spicy GA Trump folks; only talked much to one and when common ground not-in-favor of Trump surfaced he made personal denigrations of me (instead of prior Harris insults).  üôÇ  Oh that was a good reminder of how it's not a great use of time, but I still like to try every now and then.

GOTV GA!!!

the combatting disinformation training says to send these things to them. I would imagine they will need all of the fine print like who paid for the mailers, etc.

Content: Correct, but the 2020 pandemic caused a massive influx of early voting.  The 2020 early turnout I was referring to was on a national level.  I should have been more specific.

Content: You'll get emails about the event from the right people regardless of a phone call or not. We call to confirm people still plan on it and to answer any questions. When people call though, we can't see your personal info. So, if the email someone used had a typo or anything we wouldn't be able to know. That's why I mentioned it above. All registered folks should receive detailed instructions that are kept secret until closer to event.

Content: Got it. We got the email from mobilize, but it has no details on where it is etc. They told my friend on the phone where it is but I want to be sure we can both get in with just that autogenerated email or if we should wait for a more detailed one. Just wasn‚Äôt sure how it came.

We could use some help posting campaign-related news to those. We find all of the posts for you -- you don't have to do any work besides posting a few articles here and there (depends on when there's a rally or other event).

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!

So, to keep everyone within the laws, we ask server members to not post ballot or voting selfies, and we have to delete any that are posted. Thank you in advance for understanding, and for being an engaged voter!"

Content: Hey folks! Thank you for joining us. **Together, we will write the next chapter in the greatest story ever told.**

Phonebanking is our **number one priority** so close to the election, and it‚Äôs a phenomenal way to get started. We often set goals for specific numbers, like how we set a goal for 5 million calls this past weekend. We made 4.6 million, reaching immense numbers of people!

We‚Äôre 300,000 calls behind our goal for the day, and we urgently need to call Wisconsin voters. Early voting starts today in Wisconsin, and people need voting plans! We‚Äôre only **14 days away** from the election!

[Can we count on you to help us? Please, click here to get started and call directly into Wisconsin!](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=32641249-daa7-4253-b97b-df11f362bdb3&ref=go_kh_calls_wi&utm_source=hfp_w_go_calls_20241022&utm_campaign=hfp_w_go_mb_do_vol_vrec_calls_20241022&utm_medium=go_kh_calls_20241022&utm_term=go_kh_calls_20241022)

We know it‚Äôs scary for many of you. I have the same anxiety as well. But a second trump administration is much scarier. We can do this!

When I first saw the name  Shawn Harris, I thought of the author and podcaster.  This is what happens with a common name. üôÇ
