Content: The system keeps dialing a Christine. Are we redialing the same person or are they alphabetical by first name?

Content: Yes, our lists are alphabetical. You should be able to see the phone number changing as you call different voters. However, sometimes the dialer malfunctions and calls the same person twice. You can always try reloading it, and please let us know if it is repeatedly dialing one number.

Content: They are in fact alphabetical by first name.  You can also look to the right to make sure the last name is changing
