Content: I have officially called and emailed every single democratic office in Ohio and PA, and requested info from two dem offices Iâ€™m on volunteer lists for who called me, on attending or on who my local reps are, and I have not obtained one drop of info on how to attend the Pittsburgh PA reproductive rights tour rally. I am very frustrated. If anyone has gone to one and can share how they got tickets, or if anyone knows how to get them outside the advice Iâ€™ve already gotten here, please let me know. I saved all my bday money in case the tickets are expensive and this issue is so important to me ðŸ¥¹ Iâ€™ve been trying all week to get answers. Now everythingâ€™s closed. Iâ€™m desperate! Please help! The rallyâ€™s this Monday so I need to figure it out this weekend if I can.

Content: Hello <@1275940050772951051> I love your energy, I know it is so meaningful to be able to show up for yourself by showing up in support of our candidates. The details of rallies so far have all been last minute announcements, for security reasons. Often the best place for last minute info is social media. Check on Kamala's or the campaigns social accounts.

Content: I would check on Sunday, and keep in mind every rally is different, some are by invite, others are for the public, and Pittsburg is probably going to have hightened security do the shooting in Butler.
