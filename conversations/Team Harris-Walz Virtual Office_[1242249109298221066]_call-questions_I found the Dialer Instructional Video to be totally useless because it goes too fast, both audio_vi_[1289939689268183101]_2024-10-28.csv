Are you able to stop, rewind, review?  If not, you can always go into a Phone Bank for their instructions at the top of a session, then you will be set to make calls on your schedule once we roll out Anytime Dialing.  The Phone Banks also have people there to help you with any tech issues you may have, and there is a practice room where you can try things out before you start making live calls.  I hope this helps.  Thanks for being here.  Every person making calls for Kamala is important.  Phone Banking has proven to increase voter turnout by 3.8% and that can make the difference in a swing district/state."
