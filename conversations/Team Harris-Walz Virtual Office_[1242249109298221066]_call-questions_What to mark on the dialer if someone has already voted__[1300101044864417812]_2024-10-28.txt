Content: Depending on the script, you may find an Already Voted option on the Vote Plan page. If you're NOT seeing that, select the method that they plan on voting. Once the records in their state catch up to our list, they'll be removed from call list.

Content: We are allowed to ask and they are allowed to decline to answer.  Please mark these as "refused/hostile" on page one of the script.

Content: I also had a few voters who answered my initial intro with "I've already voted" and then hung up before I could ask who they voted for.  Suggestion for script change - add an option for the first set of responses to be "already voted, 
refused further conversation".
