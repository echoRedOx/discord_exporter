  content: 'This wasn''t on one of our phonebanks but I also work with the ones for
    PA Dems and we had a volunteer tonight who called a guy who is a fierce LGBTQ
    ally and he said he is voting for Harris because he doesn''t want someone in office
    that will take the rights of those he loves away.


    Also, we just got one just a couple seconds ago on the 9PM shift of our campaign''s
    banks where the person answered the call at a wedding and not only thanked the
    volunteer but also said while he can''t phone bank, he''s donating to the campaign!
    This is what I''m talking about, people! This is what we need in this world...we
    need to bring good back!'

    years old and with a walker, and although she''s pretty fed up with politicians
    who don''t keep their promises, and was disgusted by an ad that showed how Kamala
    Harris had paid money for kids to go have gender reassignment surgery, I let her
    know that was a lie and that she should go to kamalaharris.com and click issues
    at the top. We discussed for about 5 minutes what a dangerous, unqualified and
    untrustworthy candidate Donald Trump is, and finally she had made a plan to get
    out and vote. I only felt badly that I couldn''t give her a ride to the polling
    location myself!'

    but have gotten nothing but nice people (and polite refusals or hangups). I guess
    most people are too polite (or conflict averse!) to cuss you out.  I did have
    one guy tell me I was very misguided but he did so in such a friendly tone it
    took a minute for me to understand what he meant!

  content: 'From recent phone banks: two strong Harris supporters who''d gotten disconnected
    from the movement and were only too happy to learn they could still volunteer:  A
    Nevadan who''d just retired to AZ and was happy to learn he and his wife could
    phonebank for us into NV...  A Philadelphian who had to take care of his elderly
    father and was feeling alone but had found community through canvassing earlier
    and wanted to vote early and help out on election day.  ETA:  These were not volunteer
    recruitment calls...  but they turned into recruitment and solidarity too.'

  content: I just had the most AMAZING call with a voter in PA. I have spoken to undecided
    voters before, but I can't usually convince them all the way during a phone call.
    However, this undecided voter is voting for Kamala Harris, and he also needed
    info about where/when/how which I sent him. This was after a long stream of hang-ups/refused.
    This made my day and I wanted to share!
