  content: You are expected to know which server a person DMing you belongs to. It
    is not in their job/function description. I don't know if they are from Newsom,
    or Harris server, or another

  content: Ideally, we try to stay in the main channels and avoid DMing here. If you
    need to know what servers you and another user share, you can right click on their
    name and hit "profile" and it will list all the mutual servers. Hope that helps!
