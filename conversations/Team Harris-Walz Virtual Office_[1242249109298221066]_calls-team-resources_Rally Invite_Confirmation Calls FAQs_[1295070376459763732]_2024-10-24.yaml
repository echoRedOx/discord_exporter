  content: "**What do I tell someone who asks me the address of the event/time of\
    \ the event?**\nThey will receive more information in the confirmation email.\
    \ Due to security reasons, we don\u2019t have more specific information. \n\n\
    **What if they want to bring a friend/family member/their kids?**\nThe more the\
    \ merrier! The person they are bringing has to also RSVP separately and get a\
    \ confirmation email as well. The invitation/ sign up link can be shared, but\
    \ the RSVP/confirmation email is unique to the person it\u2019s addressed to and\
    \ non-transferable. Kids under 18 do not need an RSVP form or an ID. \n\n**What\
    \ if they haven\u2019t gotten their confirmation email yet?**\nTell them to check\
    \ their spam folder. It will arrive 24-36 hours before the event.\n\n**Will they\
    \ still get the email confirmation if they don\u2019t get a call?**\nYes! They\
    \ will get the email confirmation regardless of whether they get a phone call.\n\
    \n**Is it ADA accessible?**\nAll of our events should be ADA accessible. There\
    \ should be a contact email on their confirmation email that they can reach out\
    \ to to ask about accessibility information. \n\n**Can they bring bags/medical\
    \ items/food/etc?**\nSecurity information relating to all of these items and protocol\
    \ should be included in the confirmation email."
