Been making calls for Alsobrooks.  I am concerned that there have been no virtual events on Mobilize (that i have seen) to do any virtual calls or virtual textbanks for April McClain Delaney.  I receive email messages from her campaign stating how close the race between her and Republican Neil Parrot is for the House Seat.  I feel more online virtual events need to be done to get her elected!

I just got an invite from MD DEMS asking me to join the montgomery college rally. I msged the person back requesting they add virtual options for these rallies/speaking engagements for those who can't go out to events as well as adding textbanking for Delaney & phonebanking. they should do textbanking for Alsobrooks too! I hope he passes that request on. Mail in ballot voting will begin possibly 20th Sept- Oct 5th . maybe they are textbanking at in person locations or calling. idk. but there are none for supporters to do virtually for Delaney except one virtual phonebank I participated in & imo it was like Delaney was an afterthought as far as communicating it to voters. does anyone know when & how to watch Hogan alsobrooks debate & is there 1 for Delaney & Parrot.

I may try 2 keep an eye on which over the air shows what. like nbc has some against him. this morning my local ABC SINCLAIR affiliate had one against her. finally saw 1 against Hogan. have seen ZERO for Delaney at all & I don't think my dad has either.  but maybe they're targeting ads to more republican areas of the state? idk. I asked if he saw any for kamala. he said maybe a couple. ppl are voting here already mail in ballots. I wonder why barely any ads for harris? or...maybe targeting Republican areas...then again someone in neighborhood has parrot sign & previously had Trump sign so..

I did my best to do due diligence and then I did my ballot. but there is a HUGE PROBLEM. there isn't info on county or circuit court judges'  views.  general info on them & their general answers to unimportant questions does nothing. it's NUTS. it's like a secret. I hope ppl who are on a position do something about this so voters can be informed.we as voters are not informed or provided with info in order to vote on judges! I found it utterly unacceptable.
