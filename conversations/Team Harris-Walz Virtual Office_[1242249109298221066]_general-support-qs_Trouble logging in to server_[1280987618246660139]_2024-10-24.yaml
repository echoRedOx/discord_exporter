  content: "Not entirely sure if this is a tech or discord question.  \nIn adding\
    \ 2FA I had a glitch with my pw manager and have lost my discord pw and I can't\
    \ change the pw without the current.  \nI tried logging in from my phone (on a\
    \ Mac here) and the Authy app seemed to get me in, but not on any channels.  Team\
    \ H-W shows up, but says I'm in a weird space with no channel access.  \n1) How\
    \ do I get back on channels?\n2) How do I change my pw without a current one?"
