I was only on the Zoom call for a little while but I think that closing the browser session and re-opening it and then relaunching the dialer resolved it. If you are on another phone banking session and have it re-occur, ask in the chat window. It would be good for them to know in case it is happening to a lot of other people too. And thanks so much for making calls with us! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>"

If you let us know when you were calling and into what list, we can verify and triple check that there was no funny business here."
