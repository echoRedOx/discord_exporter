Content: Both the <#1252676126698897429> and <#1250876565366243348> are excellent, but I need links to send in email, so they can have a wider reach.  How to do this? As it is now, if a I copy a link, the reader has to log in at Discord. That's no good and counter productive.

Content: For <#1252676126698897429>, followed the instructions to paste the link in the email.  Send the email to myself, clicked on the URL in the received email, and it goes to the image on Discord, so that method doesn't work for people who don't have Discord accounts.

Content: The only way I can use the <#1252676126698897429> posts is to click on the link, which takes me to "X", whereupon I can right-click on the post (a video), copy the link, and then paste it into my email.  Unfortunately, I won't use "X", as Muskrat has demonstrated his hypocrisy , facist tendencies, AND supports Trump.   I haven't a clue why you folks decided on using "X"??

Content: It would be great to be able to bulk download all these fine videos and images--it would make it SOO much easier and faster to distribute these campaign messages to a wider audience.  Many people use Facebook and/or email, and more.  Please consider a bulk download capability.  Thank you ðŸ™‚

Content: Hi Steve, make sure to choose "copy link" that will copy the X link.
