Content: Hi! I am currently living in Massachusetts after many years in California. In 2004 and 2008, my family used to take me up to New Hampshire to see the candidates speak and to volunteer. I’m mostly doing online stuff with this distributed organizing team this year from home, but depending on how things go I may come up to NH to help (or at least tell my parents to). I’ve also signed up to work on the NH voter protection hotline from home. Anyway, just here to say hi for now! I’ve already been to the Manchester and Nashua offices once and done a couple NH virtual discussion events so have met some people, but not many yet.

Content: Hello NH!! I was wondering if there are any initiatives happening in NH with college students- specifically with registering students to vote (most should be eligible to vote in NH by November I think) and/or targeting NH students attending college out of state with how to request absentee ballots? That’s where I’d really like to volunteer my time!

Content: Gov. Sununo has a bill on his desk that will make an original birth cert or passport required for same-day registration and eliminates affidavits to waive the requitlrement. It's unclear if he'll sign it in time for it to be in place for Nov, but it's something to watch. When We All Vote is a nationwide group founded by Michelle Obama (I think) that targets young voters. I'm not sure which state level organizations are specifically working this. Maybe 603Forward?

Content: Are you referring to the campaign event? No one knows right now, it says details are not public yet. It also doesn’t specify whether it’s a rally or a fundraiser etc. Just posted so people can keep a look out if interested

Content: It’s a bit confusing, I got 2 email invites plus a phone call invite yesterday. Filled out the google doc RSVP form (different from this link) for both me and my mom, only I got the text from mobilize. Supposedly they will email more info today if you are confirmed but an organizer in NH told me this morning that the event is already full and closed to new signups. So I’m not sure what this mobilize link is but my understanding is that you had to have filled out the more detailed google form they sent with the invite in order to get on the list. I do hope it’s a bit more than a tarmac stop but I’ll take what I can get 😀

Content: Even those of us who were invited and on the list do not have the location. I believe they are announcing that very last minute for security reasons. In terms of invites, it seems like they were sent directly by local democratic parties and campaign offices, probably to frequent volunteers first. I’m guessing/wondering if the event is on the smaller side because there was never a public link like there were with the big rallies. I’m so happy she is taking NH seriously and hopefully she will be back again at least once!

Content: Seemingly this will be an important speech in regards to her economic policies. A state organizer which I spoke to earlier said to expect the event to run 12p-6p. 

The difference between the Mobilize link is that it offers a general admission v. the Form is for "friends and family" (active party members and organizers).

Content: Spent the day door knocking in Windham / Salem today. Some observations: 

- We are still in voter identity time. This means we are looking for people have been voters in the past and who were unaffiliated, or who have voted Democrat in the past, but may not be diehard Dems. This is very common in NH. 
- There were a lot of voters who were undecided. Speaking to voters is very important. Marile was great at talking about Project 2025, I pushed that VP Harris was in New Hampshire last week speaking about her Economic Plan and the local news have done a great deal of coverage of the event. (Thankfully, NH has a lot of very active local newspapers). 
- Yes, there were some Tr-mp supporters (mostly men) who answered the door and wouldn't give the wives space to speak. There were also men who just didn't answer the door, despite us seeing them inside. Yes, I would rather speak to the obnoxious Tr-mp voter who literally shouted at us. At least he told me who he was. He didn't intimidate me, and frankly, he looked very small next to his big truck. 
- Favorite homes? The small family farmer whose 4 people in the household would be supporting Kamala Harris ... I picked up some local honey from her farm stand. And the woman who had just come home from a vacation in the Poconos and was thrilled to see me with my Kamala Harris and NH Democrats literature. "Thank goodness you are here!" 
- It felt great to walk and knock. We need more door knockers. We are going to be finishing Voter ID time and moving into persuasion time soon. And we need YOU to knock knock knock.

And we support you to share positive and meaningful messaging in all our channels, especially with your New Hampshire friends. I  removed this one and I encourage you to replace it with something that aligns with HFP winning the election.

Content: **ATTENTION---the New Hampshire voter protection team needs our help! **Signup links below for an informational town hall on Monday and trainings for the voter protection hotline and poll observer program. NOTE: All of these sessions are virtual. For the hotline, you can do all of the volunteering from home in OR out of state. To be a poll observer, while you do NOT need to be a New Hampshire resident, you will need to be physically present in NH on Election Day. Let me know if you have any questions! I am already working on the hotline and have a few shifts under my belt. 

Voter protection town hall (Monday, 9/30 at 6pm) https://events.democrats.org/event/639120/

Poll observer training (6 more including one TONIGHT at 6:30): https://events.democrats.org/event/684136/

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Call: Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline (833-336-8683)

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!
