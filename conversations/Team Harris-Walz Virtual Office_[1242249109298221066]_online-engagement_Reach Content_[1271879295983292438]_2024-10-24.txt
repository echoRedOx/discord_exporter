Content: Hi! Thanks so much for volunteering with us. We appreciate the question. A lot of work has been happening behind the scenes to transition the campaign to Harris. You should see NEW videos and graphics in appropriate places within Reach to use. Staff will continue to update Reach and revisit the content.

Content: New content is created every day for the campaign by staff as well as by volunteer editors and graphic artists. It is what fills Reach. Older Biden content may not necessarily be "updated" as you mention, since the teams are generally focusing on the current situation in the new Harris campaign. I encourage you to view the newest volunteer created content (before it even hits Reach sometimes) right here in Discord at <#1250876565366243348>. In addition, you can see the very latest from the campaign accounts on social at <#1252676126698897429>. Yes, please use Reach. I strongly suggest focusing on the newest additions however. Thanks again for joining us!

Content: Thanks, do you ever take suggestions. One thing for my family is border and fentanyl. My nephew was addicted and thankfully sober now but showing that messages would be impactful for them bc trump just lies and stops progress and Kamala is making real impact and I need tools to show them

Content: Thanks for donating to the campaign and volunteering. I see that you're already signed up to help us in a number of ways. While I'm not aware of opportunities to volunteer best utilizing your skills as a data strategist, we do offer opportunities to join our texting team, our event hosting team, and more. You can find many opportunities posted here: https://events.democrats.org Thanks again for your support!
