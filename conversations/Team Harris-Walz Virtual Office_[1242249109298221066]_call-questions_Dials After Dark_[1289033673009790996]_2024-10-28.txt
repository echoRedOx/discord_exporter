Content: Not sure how to label this one - I called and two people were talking, one was very hostile/inebriated (I'll call him A) and the other one (B) was attempting to listen to me. However, after asking "Is this X?" B did not confirm yes or no, so I'm leaning towards A being the one I was supposed to call. A was being loud in the back/aggressive and I heard some things breaking so I thanked B for his time and hung up. Should I classify this as Refused/Hostile?

Content: We had a vol last week who was on with a voter and things got crazy in the background. He finally told her he's a firefighter and got called to a fire but he was really trying to stay on with her and talk politics on the way ðŸ˜‚
