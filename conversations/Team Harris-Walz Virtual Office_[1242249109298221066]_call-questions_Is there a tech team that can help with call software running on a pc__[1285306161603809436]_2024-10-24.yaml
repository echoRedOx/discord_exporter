    \ that\u2019s fast and fiber. Both are Mac/iOS and updated. I\u2019ve tried in\
    \ both safari and Firefox and the call software always craps out on the Mac. On\
    \ a good day I might get a few calls to work on the pc but the software fail always\
    \ kicks in eventually. \n\nI know they like us using a phone *and* laptop, but\
    \ given my left arm is prosthetic (looks cool like a terminator, but much less\
    \ dexterous) one device is better. My phone handles the call software just fine\
    \ but trying to talk there and push buttons on the pc is rough."

  content: Hi Kai, sorry you're dealing with these issues and thank you for still
    pushing through to help! In your next session, please ask a tech captain and I'm
    certain they'll be able to help out in a breakout room. Just explain the why as
    our default is to suggest the 2 devices for simplicity sake but I hope we're able
    to help you find a way to do it easily with just the 1 device!
