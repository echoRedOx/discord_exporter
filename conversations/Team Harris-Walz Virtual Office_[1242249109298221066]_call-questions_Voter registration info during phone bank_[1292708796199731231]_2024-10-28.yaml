  content: Hi, I ran into a supporter who hadn't registered to vote yet in her state
    and asked me to text her the information. I could not because we were phone banking
    to recruit volunteers and the text message isn't customizable. Can the script
    be updated to include a text message option for voting info? Or how should I respond?
