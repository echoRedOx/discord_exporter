Content: I haven't seen any virtual trainings for Dallas unfortunately, but you could probably take an online training for a different county in Texas and go from there. You don't have to live in the county you take the training in and it's pretty much the same process statewide

Content: For anyone in Denton County looking to register as a Volunteer Deputy Registrar, the process is really easy! I just took a quick training class and assessment online (took maybe 30 minutes total). Next, you just need to take the completion certificate to an office in Denton to get your ID and supplies. Here’s the link:  https://www.votedenton.gov/training-education/volunteer-deputy-registrar-program/

Content: FYI sites like vote.org are causing some confusion with Texas voters. There's an option on there to register to vote, and it says "This will take 2 minutes." But after putting in your info,  they give you the option to either print and fill out your own form or have them mail you a completed form to then mail in to actually register. (Edit: It is easy for folks to overlook this part and think they've registered)

THERE IS NO ONLINE VOTER REGISTRATION IN TEXAS

It is best to direct people to https://www.votetexas.gov/ where the site actually explains the voter registration process. Much less likely to result in folks thinking they've registered to vote online.

Content: Popping into this channel to say hello to my fellow Texas Dems! I'm currently the Supporter Outreach Manager at the DNC and work over with the Digital Correspondence Team. Before moving to DC, I was raised in the mid-cities in DFW, and worked on Texas campaigns for a few years (after being SO inspired to take action by Beto in 2018) and worked for the Dallas County Democratic Party until earlier this year! I love love love Texas and am so happy there are so many amazing volunteers like y'all helping flip it blue. Blexas soon!! 💙

Content: If they are open to a conversation or open to being swayed I would send them and talk to them about the reasons *why* they won't vote for Kamala, 'Republicans for Harris' is on Twitter/X and facebook and have plenty of former congressmen and women at all levels of government even at the state and mayoral levels saying they are voting for her, depending on the demographic there are also unions and labor groups like LULAC (hispanic based) who have endorsed her

Content: Another volunteer had some very helpful advice regarding situations like this here: https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1242249109298221069/1276170683658797106

In general, the campaign is encouraging us to practice active listening, and really trying to connect with the person you're talking to on a personal level. Ask them questions, and like Chris says in the comment I linked to, leave them breadcrumbs to follow and reach their own conclusions. Sometimes just gently showing support for a point of view your neighbors may not have considered can move the needle a bit and sometimes it's not necessarily the person you're talking to who's being convinced, but someone else in the room who's listening.

I will also add, that our energy is best focused on reaching folks more likely to support and making sure they are registered to vote and that they show up! It's entirely possible for us to make big strides in Texas simply by increasing turnout. Get those who don't usually vote to do so and we can really turn the tide in Texas!

Content: Thanks Gillian!  I read Chris’s comments and in many ways they reminded me of when I was interviewed by Newsweek for an article on the Chinese telco giant, Huawei. I found responding to negative report based questions with a simple “Why not?” and then turning to facts that, for instance, showed in a Kinsey Report actually commissioned by Newsweek that American companies led by CEOs with military service outperformed others. Opening the door to thought with some very edible breadcrumbs. The problem was Newsweek’s mind was already made up. The article had already been written. The interview was merely to cite a conversation with me as a C-level member of Wireless Marketing. You are right. With minds closed or resistant to any discussion, maybe the best thing to do is simply encourage voter turnout. I’ll keep trying!

Content: I get that feeling. I turned 18 just in time to vote for Al Gore in 2000, and I haven't forgotten how it felt for that election to be decided the way it was. I haven't forgotten all that happened in the years that followed. I don't know about the validity of those rumors, but  if it were true...

...it would be a good way to court Anti-Trump republicans. This convention is not all about celebrating everyone who speaks. It's about winning folks to the cause. We're here to make sure Kamala Harris and Tim Walz get elected, and we have to set aside our differences and come together in order to make that happen.

Content: Trust me. I loathe Trump and republicans. I thought Walz was a perfect VP pick and wanted Biden to step down so Trump would lose. However the idea of the DNC giving Republicans multiple slots to speak and not a single Palestinian-American then to top it all off have someone like Bush speak would be too much for me. I still think Kamala will win because democrats have finally stopped trying the “when we go low, we go high” nonsense and have rightly called republicans weirdos. Also Trump is incapable of shifting his campaign strategy to adapt to Kamala and seems to miss Biden which is funny.

Content: Of course, there is the Democratic Party Platform.  It is online and in PDF form.  Those policies will correspond to campaign.  To the Republican part, we have good resources regarding Republican Support for her, so I would start there.  Go to Reach to find Republican Support for Harris. <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Content: The platforms online that I’ve been able to find are either from 2020 or they mention a second Joe Biden term. Do I just not have a the right link? I would hope for this be resolved sooner rather than later so it isn’t so confusing to simply direct people to one true platform.

Content: Hey Felix. I found something labeled talking points from a resource hub for volunteers, but because I am not a volunteer leader yet, I do not want to share it here. However, once you sign up for volunteer training, like phone bank, text bank etc, you will get the Talking Points.  Don't want to offend any mods accidentally. Thanks mods and Felix. 🙂

Content: Finally, in an attempt to be more helpful without over-sharing other info, I did happen across this event, which reminds me of the pivoting to counter misinformation training. This event is led by a volunteer in IN, but it is likely to be similar in terms of talking to conservative people, given that both states are conservative. There is only one time slot so far.  Hopefully, it will work for you. https://events.democrats.org/event/465597/

Ex-Republican here. I’ve been using Politifact for fact-checking and created a visual aid based on over 9,000 individual ratings. It’s been super helpful when discussing the importance of integrity in our politics. If anyone’s interested, I’ve got a seven-page report to share, but I’m not sure about the rules for sharing data here. Happy to provide more details!

Content: <@553038369530052618> so sorry for the back and forth on your post. We're working around campaign finance laws and unfortunately none of us mods are lawyers 😉

We LOVE Powered by People! They're a wonderful group, and--on a personal note--I got my VDR training through them earlier this month 💙
Unfortunately, due to the big blue "Donate" button at the top of the page, we are unable to allow that specific link on this server. If they have a link that doesn't mention fundraising you can absolutely share that and I would encourage you to do so!
Apologies again for all the confusion 💙

Content: Hi Allison! I'm in Dallas county and I'm planning to get reciprocal certification for VDR in Collin county! (I need to call and make that appointment today--thank you for the reminder 😊) 
For ways to get involved locally, I hear good things about:

• Collin County Democrats (You might consider [becoming a precinct chair or working with your precinct chair](https://www.collindemocrats.org/what-is-it-like-to-be-a-precinct-chair-democrats-collin-county/) to turn out voters in your neighborhood)
• Richardson Area Democrats
• Powered by People is doing some great work, too. (As I can attest from personal experience!)

You also might consider reaching out to the campaigns for local candidates as I'm sure they could point you in the right direction! I hear that the race for Ted Cruz's senate seat is actually within the realm of possibility this election 👀 so that might be a good one to collaborate with. I think we all remember Cruz running off for a little vacation while the rest of us froze in our homes 🥶 Sure would feel good to give him the boot! 😉

Content: Hey for the PxP text team if you know anything about that team, do you have to be VDR certified? Im thinking about doing the VDR training anyways but they weren’t clear on the specific to me because don’t the text team send forms if needed for registration, and wouldn’t that fall under what VDR people do?

Content: Thank you for your question The Poynter Institute for Media Studies, established in 1975 in St. Petersburg, Florida, is a non-profit journalism school and research organization. It owns the Tampa Bay Times and operates the International Fact-Checking Network and PolitiFact. Their methodology for fact-checking is detailed here: https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/.

The Institute maintains web pages for political figures and social media outlets, which track PolitiFact fact-checks. These checks typically begin with statements that gain media attention or appear in online postings. I accessed candidate pages (here is Joe's https://www.politifact.com/personalities/joe-biden/) and lists of mainstream social media pages, then recorded the fact-check results in a spreadsheet, then graphed it.

This specific graph exclusively represents data from presidential candidates, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, Donald Trump, and J.D. Vance, so the party affiliations are factual and not based on opinion. The media data is aggregated from various sources with combined fact-check scoring from platforms and figures such as X Posts, Facebook Posts, Instagram, Viral Images, Bloggers, TikTok, Threads, PunditFact, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Rachel Maddow. Each source has its respective PolitiFact page, ensuring the scoring is accurate as of last weekend. All this data has been categorized under the umbrella term "Media" and is neither scored as Democrat or Republican.

Content: I just got an email about a nearby registration event - ooh that's already at full capacity for volunteers! 🎉 - that says:

"You don't need to be a VDR  to volunteer with us (at this event), we'll make sure you have everything you need to successfully register voters with us!"

That said, that may not apply to all events PLUS the training isn't long and we really can't have enough VDRs at this point lol

Content: We registered voters at Texas State today with Beto. If you’re near a big university, check to see if he’s coming to your campus. You don’t have to be a VDR for these either, but it’s helpful. We had about 15 VDRs and 5 non VDRs working.

Content: There's no specific role or tag for any of the cities, but the search function is super helpful for finding posts regarding a specific topic. Mentioning the city in your post will make sure it's easily searchable for folks coming in later! <:blobLoudSpeaker:1278209125448290428>

Content: I believe the rules are that non-official events can be shared in <#1268426751164551199> AND the state channels to which they correspond so you should be good. If you wanted to be super-safe you could post them first to <#1268426751164551199> and then post a link to the message here, but I believe that is only necessary for sharing non-official events outside of these channels

Content: Yup, my sibling was removed! 

PROTIP: I've been directing folks to their local library for a voter registration form, as "updating" it online just means you have to wait for the mail-in form to get to you. At least this way, you only have to send it off!

Content: 1- I wonder if there's some way to do a sound off with what part of TX we're all from, to get better connected and involved locally, or create our own breakout topics for (EG) A-news, B-action points, C-voting info, D-local connections...

2-Similar to <@209113829324488704> I'm also pretty focused on turning TX blue - because we have exciting races that are really close! - and I'm getting connected with state-wide groups like:
Texas Democrats,
Texans for Kamala,
Powered By People, etc.
(+Bexar Co Dems & more)

I'm happy to keep sharing news & urgent asks!

Content: 1 (cont'd): What if we had a (pinned) living document that broke out region contacts and groups/how to get involved?

I'm imagining a Google Sheet with tabs like:
-TX Orgs (volunteer links/ contact info ONLY per FEC donation rules)
-Austin volunteers
-DFW/North TX
-San Antonio/South TX
-Houston/East TX
-El Paso/West TX

Because sure we're in an expensive state to campaign in, but if we have a good system in place, it could make all the difference in our ground game!

Content: Serious question here: Does anyone have any idea why Colin Allred's campaign spots aren't directly addressing Ted Cruz' terrible policies and failures for the people here in TX? Or why he's not joining forces with someone like Jasmine Crockett, who has a lot of momentum going?  It just seems like there's a goldmine of opportunity there that he's not taking advantage of. I really want him to win this one so we can get Cruz out, you know?

Content: It took me over a month to get my VDVR sorted out here in Houston.  They didn't mail me my cert for over 2 weeks (expected delivery 10 days), then they didn't respond to my email for almost a week, then mailed me a packet with someone else's name on it.  I finally had to go downtown and just do it in person.

They said they were super busy was the reason.  I hope that was the reason and not this whole voter suppression thing.

Content: Another interesting point - in Bexar Co alone, there are around 368,000 potential Democratic voters... that's more than Cruz's last win margin! So voter registration efforts in every county are essential! 🎉

Content: Absolutely! (And I get the shift struggle.) You may want to click through because many events have multiple times available. I'm also involved in (non-official grassroots group) Texans For Kamala... we're doing a statewide phone bank this wkd, let me see if I can find you a local contact who can provide guidance!

Content: Hello! I'm Caroline. While I'm Manhattan-based, I'll be flying back to Galveston County, Texas in October because I'm registered to vote there. I judged that Texas needs my vote more than New York State (although I do fight for downballots there too).


I am also a writer and member of the Vietnamese community. Do we have any Vietnamese Harris supporters here? Unfortunately, large populations of Texas Vietnamese are ardent Republican-Trump supporters and are exposed to disinformation campaigns about Kamala Harris. So Vietnamese (and fellow Texas Asians) should connect with me.

And I do think it's important for non-Asians to be aware of the disinformation amuck in our communities.

Content: Gooood morning <#1268378299428634727>  !

Take this with a big grain of salt (and a bunch of motivation to turn out voters!), but the poll-based website 270towin just posted it's latest map and guess what?? TX is showing as a tossup (margin <5%)!

(Keep in mind, this map updates 3x daily, this is ONLY a snapshot of polling as of Sun 9/8 8pm EDT.)

Not linking in case of pesky donation buttons, but the site has an interactive map you can play around with!

I have not yet signed up to do door knocking, so I don’t have access to any good promotional material, but I do have a few friends who asked me if I have some kind of leaflet or flier that succinctly outlines Kamala’s platform. Is there something online I could print out that has this info?

Content: I’ve been making calls and knocking on doors for Colin Allred’s Senate campaign, and while folks are excited to be voting against Ted Cruz, not enough are familiar with Colin. Turning out the vote is a lot more reliable when people are voting for something. If you want to help spread the word and get your fellow Texans excited about the alternative to Ted, virtual phone banks are happening every day.

Content: I'm from Texas and would love to help in Texas campaigns but moved out of state so I'd like to know if there's a need for vote team members on these calls also please. I don't mind making calls also if links are posted but I haven't had to time to keep up with this chat lately.

Content: While I'm here, I have a small victory to celebrate! I went to visit my parents over the weekend and ran an impromptu Friendbank just for them. They were both resistant but went along with it for my sake 😉 

My mom has since recruited multiple volunteers across the country, including one in San Antonio who's volunteered to host a GOTV party and rent out a van or maybe even a BUS(!?!?) to transport folks to the polls 😭😭😭

Don't ever let anyone tell you the work we're doing doesn't make a difference!! 🥰🥰🥰

Content: Thx for the tags, mod team! Hi <@1211542714932396032> and <@425699119756083201>... I'm working with Texans For Kamala. We just spent the last 3 days figuring out independent in-person/virtual phonebanks, (thus playing catch up lol) so I have plenty of resources & best practices for anyone who wants to set up their own pb or jump in with us - we're in locations across the state and will be joining the Harris campaign, doing weekly calls on Mondays. (Which means we're not necessarily calling Texans.)

As for Colin Allred & other TX-wide campaigns, I'm still in the process of getting connected and hope to find out what they need - but there are really great GOTV campaigns like Beto's PXP and I'm often working out of the NE Bexar Co Dems office, so if anyone wants *info that can't be shared on this Discord per campaign finance laws* ..... 👀 ..... shoot me a PM and we can talk offline. (Hoping that's acceptable lol <@763374129772363776> please advise if not.)

Content: Some info on TX statewide races - PLEASE NOTE: PER FEC LAWS, WE CANNOT ALLOW ANY LINKS WITH DONATION BUTTONS:

(US Senate) Voting for Colin Allred could be a HUGE win for holding the US Senate! Plus send a huge sign to Ted Cruz, who officially has the most vulnerable seat in the GOP. 
* Events/Volunteer Opportunities: https://www.mobilize.us/texasoffense/

(US House) Michelle Vallejo is our ONLY US House candidate (for TX-15) this district stretches narrowly from Seguin down through Floresville, Alice, to McAllen. This is a SIGNIFICANT race for Republicans hoping to keep the House majority.
* 😭  I need to find a contact in her campaign, there is a donate button on every page so we can't link to "michellefortx15" at all

(TX Supreme Court) There are also 3 TX Supreme Court candidates who could have huge impacts on things like abortion; lgbtq+ rights, protections; etc.: 
- DaSean Jones
- Christine Weems
- Bonnie Lee Goldstein

(Progressive GOTV) Beto's Powered By People campaign is going full-speed until the 10/7 voter registration deadline! If you're local, check out their TONS of volunteer opportunities getting likely Dems registered/motivated:
- https://www.mobilize.us/poweredxpeople/

As for other races - there's a really cool (org) website *I can't link to* called Common Cause where you can find a personalized list of your districts to get involved with your local candidates! 😉

Content: If you missed it in the flood of info above lol, there is a brand new issues page! www.kamalaharris.com/issues

I personally love that it breaks down categories and then compares her policy to his. There's also great resources being shared out by HQ on social... maybe the best printable solution might be a postcard-sized graphic with a link or QR code to the issues page... 🤔

Content: Modhat on: Had to remove your article bc of the pesky donation button on their site (per FEC laws), sorry!

Modhat off: I was just reading about this (paywall free, but also with donate button) on TPR! *cough cough* ("Walz tells Texas Democrats a U.S. Senate race win is within reach" 9/10)

Content: Of course, I don't think it's a good idea to post the imagery here, although I have the screenshots, but there's a certain Republican Texas Vietnamese name circulating the conspiracy that Kamala Harris was wearing, get this, AUDIO FEED earrings.

Content: Should be good! Appreciate the understanding 🙏🏼

+ another workaround (protip for paywalls): search for the article on yahoo news - they're an aggregator so if it's big enough, they should have a link where you can read/share without issues!

(I just used this to read NY Times reporting about voter suppression of LULAC activists! Such a helpful tip from someone in news convo!)

Content: Hi all: Democrats Abroad, the "state chapter" of the Democratic Party for Americans living abroad, is hosting a Zoom call this Sunday at 11AM EST to help Texans living outside the US with questions related to getting ballots and making sure they are counted. I can't link to the event here due to campaign finance laws, but you can find more info in the DA Events section (events appear chronologically).

Content: <@1274293080794595339> that is a perfectly rational assumption. If only campaign finance law were equally intuitive 😂. We spend a lot of time in the mod chats talking through what is and what isnt permissible for that very reason. Thanks for adjusting and for being here to let ppl know about these opportunities.

be 65 years or older;
be sick or disabled;
be out of the county on election day and during the period for early voting by personal appearance; or
be expected to give birth within three weeks before or after Election Day; or
be confined in jail, but otherwise eligible.

The republican legislature unfortunately passed a bunch of restrictions on it though

Content: Saw that earlier. Pretty blatant voter suppression to try to win congressional/ state legislative races in South Texas. No other reason why they would be investigating “voter fraud” in an area that has swing heavily toward republicans

Content: Yeah it’s really annoying. They literally put in there that they want to require candidates for statewide office to win a majority of counties (page 7, link to platform in article) and proposed a referendum on secession. How much more blatant can they get?

Content: Hey there! Just catching up, but I get the concern- maybe you can go with a friend or try early voting? (Starts 10/21-11/1 and there are MUCH smaller crowds, so it should be an easy in-out in person experience.) You can also bring a document that proves your residence as backup if that helps with any anxieties - like a rental agreement.

Content: Am I being a worrywart? I subscribe to Native news online because I am half Native American. The disrespect shown the Native community by Tim Sheehy in Montana hasn't even been addressed by the Harris/Walz campaign. And that senate seat is crucial to keeping the democratic senate. Harris and Walz need to (even briefly) appear on that reservation and the campaign needs to see that the Native vote is not being taken for granted or we'll lose the senate and be hamstrung by republicans. Again. How do I get the attention of someone who can get this message to the Campaign managers?

Content: “Moreover, Newman has claimed that extreme weather was God’s punishment for America’s tolerance for abortion and gay rights”

“Newman co-authored the book with Cheryl Sullenger, who was earlier convicted and imprisoned for her involvement in an attempt to bomb an abortion clinic in California in 1987.”

“In addition to suggesting the US government kill abortion providers, Newman and Sullenger wrote that the tendency to blame abortion providers and liberal lawmakers for abortions—rather than the women who obtain them—is a mistake:”

Content: On this National Voter Registration Day, I found that my League City, Galveston County, Texas ballot ALSO has this city council election and city propositions. 

Always check your CITY (not just county) election site to see if you have anything. I say this because Trumpian Qanoners have taken advantage of low-turnout local races.

Content: oh no! There are so many new developments and rural areas that this is a legit problem. Remind me where you are? 

I *have* heard that Harris County (for example) just hasn't listed a ton of their voting locations yet. Maybe this is the case?

Early voting locations will be populated in our search site "My Voter Portal" two days prior to the first day of early voting. Here, you can enter your Name, County, Date of Birth and ZIP code to look up your registration information and find your nearest polling location. You may want to contact the Early Voting Clerk for State and County Elections in your county for early voting locations. Also, many newspapers publish early voting polling locations.

Content: Hi <#1268378299428634727> Fam! 

I volunteered to organize the Women’s March here in Dallas on November 2nd and it got approved by Women’s March Inc on Monday. They are marching on D.C. same day and time.  

I’m working on the permit to host it in Dallas. City Hall Plaza and the Ronald Kirk Bridge are booked. My team is checking with Klyde Warren Park. 

I could use some help. Please DM me if: 
1) you know of locations that could be suitable in the city for a special event / March like this? 

2) you are able to help or have connections to others that might be able to help. 

I’ve added the event page, do sign up and share with friends. Once the location is solid we will start pushing media content for voting and marching!

Content: the best i can do is reach out to my grandma, since she used to help host all sorts of things like this (though more for the LGBT+ pride events) 

other than that, i'm a really good attendee ^^"

Content: A little tip for downballot engagement: Tell your family/friends that voting for downballots helps the infrastructure of a Kamala Harris administration.

I consulted my FB city Pantsuit group on the League City, Galveston County ballot propositions and city council. Honestly, we're confused by them, but it's a start to even talk about them. And sometimes, getting out the downballot (even in nonpartisan races) can help the presidential ticket.

Content: Amazing! I registered 6 people at a music/art festival yesterday, there were other VDRs at the tabling so I'm not sure what our final tally ended up being but it was up there! Super fun and even better when most attendees would only approach our booth to excitedly say, "We are registered, ready, and can't wait!" <:blobcheer:1278915863491383377> <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Content: I moved recently (w/in 6 mos) and I was technically fine, so you might be too. I checked initially for my fam via vote411 (haven't checked for the Button Of Doom so not linking) and saw that I think my sib's details said INVALID or SUSPENDED?

I now have access to a super handy program via reach that tells me very clearly, but it's not associated with the Harris campaign specifically.

Content: If it helps, I was worried about mailing it in and it arriving on time, so I just went to a VDR event to update my address (last Thursday, I think?)... 

I just checked - mine is all nice and shiny and updated already! If you check again and it still hasn't updated, you might want to go to a VDR event and updating with them just to be safe. <:thumbup:1252804076849074276>

Content: I’ll have to see if my town is having any of those. I haven’t heard or seen much, but there’s usually one at the mall. I’ll have to pop by there and see. 👀 Thanks for the advice! I updated my license online, so I updated my registration then. I’ll have to check it later and see if it went through.

Content: Hey all: Dems Abroad is hosting a Zoom call with candidates Colin Allred, Katherine Culbert (Railroad Commissioner), Morgan Kirkpatrick (SBoE), and Christine Weems (TX Supreme Court) on Tuesday, Sept. 24 at 1PM EST.  It's for folks abroad, but anyone can attend. I'm not sharing the link due to campaign finance laws, but you can find more info by looking up "Texas For the Win!" in the website search.

Content: Tragic news, but might help with getting out the vote for Harris/Walz: "Among Hispanic women, the rate of women dying while pregnant, during childbirth or soon after increased from 14.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019 to 18.9 in 2022. Rates among white women nearly doubled — from 20 per 100,000 to 39.1. And Black women, who historically have higher chances of dying while pregnant, during childbirth or soon after, saw their rates go from 31.6 to 43.6 per 100,000 live births." https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/texas-abortion-ban-deaths-pregnant-women-sb8-analysis-rcna171631

Content: Water mostly goes to ag, and mainly livestock. And many farms are using inefficient irrigation methods for their crops.

Content: Wow okay... that was somewhat infuriating (bc blatant praise of voter suppression efforts) but overall a fun read lol!

"Ahead of its May convention, the Texas GOP had just five employees — compared to 50 at the same point in 2020, the last presidential cycle. Last month, the party reported that its 2024 convention ran roughly $600,000 over budget and resulted in a staggering, $382,000 loss. From mid-May until early September, the Texas GOP’s most important fundraising position was vacant. And in its last financial disclosure, from June, the Texas GOP reported having $2.3 million on-hand — $1 million less than at the same time in 2020."

"[Texas GOP Chair Abraham George] spent last weekend in South Texas, which he and other Republicans see as critical because of a handful of competitive races. There, former Republican U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores is running a well-funded campaign against Democrat Rep. Vicente Gonzalez — one of a few races that could decide control of the U.S. House. And in state Senate District 27, Adam Hinojosa is challenging Democratic Sen. Morgan LaMantia in a rematch of a 2022 race that was decided by roughly 700 votes."

[Travis County GOP Chair Matt Mackowiak, who ran against George for party chair this year and organized last week’s open letter by county Republican leaders, said:] “The state party appears completely unprepared for this immensely consequential election and we all need the Texas GOP to raise its performance,” he said. “Immediately.”

Content: I’ve thrown away most of the correspondence and pamphlets her campaign keeps mailing me or leaving at my door. It specifically irritates me how they intentionally use **blue** ink and “progressive-appearing” graphics for almost everything… because I would bet most people in my district aren’t even aware she’s republican. I have family members tell me they either forgot or it never crossed their minds <:blob_cat_scared:1277980673025769613> And I’m sure she’s using that to her advantage 🙄

Content: If I still had some, I’d show them here. But basically what I mean is the type of “theme” portrayed in her pamphlets, you wouldn’t immediately take them as a GOP candidate. Very blue and grassroots almost, very opposite of MAGA… it’s hard to explain 😅

Content: Exciting moments of the rally:
*🎻 SA mariachis playing us all in - they played el rey and rinconcito!! So cool to hear such puro Latinx vibes and the whole crowd singing - at an event with a national delegate!

*Ran into LOTS of volunteers from different local groups!

*Cristela Alonzo - del valle - (first Latina to have her own show on national tv) was ON FIRE!! 🔥  and Gen Z activist Olivia Julianna was so hyped - she's super active online, and only a first-time voter!

*The Castro brothers Joaquin & Julian (with son!) along with Greg Casar spoke about fighting voter suppression and electing those who will fight for access to healthcare!
"We won't stand by while they try to rig the system!"

*(SA) Mayor Ron came out to talk about why local elections are so important... and how Doug Emhoff & VP Harris came out and listened to our needs during the pandemic and made sure our food banks could provide for our communities... while Cruz & Abbot worked for themselves instead.

*Local TX-house candidates Kristian Carranza & Laurel Jordan Swift spoke about providing for our SA neighbors, our students, and the importance of making our voices heard at every level of government!

*And Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff "let me brag about my wife" spoke so passionately about his support of his wife Kamala!! He says: Keep the enthusiasm going for the next 43 day - YOU have the power!

Content: He’s running as more moderate and doesn’t have to worry about low base enthusiasm because it’s a presidential year. He also doesn’t seem to plan on visiting every county, which was admirable but didn’t have much of an effect on the vote margins.

Content: Yep, still hoping I can get a legal first name change, not planning on the gender marker. Clarification: I do not care about my birth certificate, as long as I have a court order for my State ID and SS card, the documents I need for US employment and banking.

I WillVote dot com is the DNC preferred site for voting info.  Donate button on an org site is okay because fundraising is not the main purpose of the site. https://www.vote411.org/texas

Content: I pinged a Ukrainian-American friend in NJ to spread the word about Allred after seeing "Lyin' Ted"'s trashy comments about Zelenskyy. Just shameful, Z has stood by his people (and even met with DJT yesterday, which must have been very difficult) while Ted left Texas and poor Snowflake the Dog behind for Cancún and generally does nothing of value.

Content: Good. "A federal judge ruled on Saturday that part of a Texas law that enacted new voting restrictions violated the U.S. Constitution by being too vague and restricting free speech. The ruling, made by U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez, immediately halted the state’s ability to investigate alleged cases of vote harvesting, such as the investigation into the League of United Latin American Citizens by Attorney General Ken Paxton." https://www.texastribune.org/2024/09/28/texas-vote-harvesting-law-unconstitutional/

Content: i think what they mean is, saying that Allred is 101% guaranteed to win means we dont' have to give any effort. because he'd be 101% guaranteed to win.

what makes more sense is to fight as if Allred is losing, because while Allred is making progress, the race isn't over and it's a close race for sure.

Content: Do we got any Galveston County, Texas voters like me?

I use the wonderful nonpartisan Vote411, but it mysteriously doesn't have the Senate profile. Vote411 is great, but sometimes it misses some important races, so sometimes you have to look directly at your CITY/COUNTY election sites to catch those local races.

I'm also trying hard to understand my League City propositions. But I barely see any support from my county Democratic party. And Downballots are important.

Content: no you're not alone. it doesn't have anything for my area at all (last i checked) in terms of early voting. i was able to find that info through Texas's voting site. 

but i honestly attributed that to being i live in a teeny tiny town north of Dallas

Content: So a great rule of thumb is that Vote411 is good but also check with your COUNTY and CITY-specific election websites, cause it might miss things early on.

Content: Charts, graphs, info. It's a lot but here are some takeaways: 
- Registrations rolls are outpacing Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia
- Registration is surpassing population growth, “a sign that more than just new Texans are signing up to vote”
- Texas added almost 2.6 million voters — the size of Connecticut’s entire voting rolls
- Republicans strategists say Texas is “at risk” of following other Southwestern states like Arizona and Nevada
- In 6 years Dems flipped: 12 Texas House seats, 2 Texas Senate seats, and 2 seats in Congress 
- Causing R’s to redraw congressional and legislative districts in the latest redistricting cycle 
- As Harris County gets bluer, statewide margins get tighter
- R’s still have rural West and East Texas, but aren’t adding new voters at the rate of Harris County and the blue spine

Content: Feel free to delete this but I like these types of analyses and I think it’s important to understand Texas politics.

It’s also important to note how conservative DFW and Houston suburbs are. Tarrant county is rather conservative for how urban it is, barely voting for Biden in 2020. DFW’s Collin County was among the most populous counties to vote for Trump in 2020, even though Trump’s margin was only 4 points, almost 30 points lower than Romney’s in 2012. Therefore, there’s a good chance Collin flips blue this year. Montgomery County, which contains suburbs north of Houston, gave Trump 70% of the vote and a margin of almost 120,000, which I believe was his largest in the country (mostly due to the prominence of the oil and gas industry around Houston). However, this was also much lower than Romney’s 80% in 2012. Although the DFW and Houston metro areas have shifted significantly toward Democrats, there is still a lot of work to do.

Content: Catching up... I've been busy helping PXP with the last few days' push for VR and 😍 🎉  I love that you shared this <@958395273313411153> !! This is the same article that my group got super excited about! It's so promising to hear that not only is the work of PXP and other groups paying off in # of new registrations (take THAT Paxton!) but also the article discusses how this is affecting statewide and downballot races all over!

<:blueheart:1252803082849488956>  We LOVE to see it!!!  <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> 

(Also I've been talking to organizers in swing states like WI, PA... they are super excited about TX becoming the next battleground and *ahem* let me just share one's feedback for us verbatim...)

Content: I know Texas wants to be a battleground or a lean blue state so bad. All she really needs is a little push. I truly believe she could pull a 2016 - 2020 Georgia assuming the work on the ground is similar! Plus a bunch of left leaning voters moving in!

Content: I like the optimism and there’s a chance of it happening (though by then Kamala will be over 350 electoral votes) but it’s important to understand that it’s a lot more expensive to organize in Texas than Georgia since it’s a lot larger and you have to do much more in Spanish (not saying that’s a bad thing, just that it makes it more expensive). 

Although the state Republican party’s increasing extremism should push away moderate voters, there are many Republicans that have moved in from states like California because of it (my parents know some and I’ve overheard some conversations). I have also read that their harmful policies have also pushed some marginalized Texans out of the state, especially trans Texans. Again, I’m not saying it won’t happen, but it’s important to understand the state of things. It can help us focus our efforts and set realistic expectations.

Content: No it’s true. What’s happening in real time is more important than any theoretical numbers. Texas is a very expensive market as it’s pretty much one of the most vast states in the union (I know Alaska’s bigger, but I feel like you could visit fewer places and get Alaska compared to Texas where you’d have to visit a LOT of places.)

I do think if it ever breaks blue and can stay there, it could very well become a Dem stronghold like California and NY currently are, or a consistent swing state.

Content: The fact we’re seeing political ads for a presidential election for the first time in years tells me internal polling on both sides says there’s a chance we flip blue. Add to that Ken Paxton trying so hard to keep us from voting. 
Another thing to remember is incremental change is still change. Even if we can’t flip the state, if we can send a few more democrats to the US house and the Texas legislature, that would help. Firing Ted Cruz in favor of Colin Allredd would be even bigger.

Content: Looked up what happened to their predecessor and it’s completely unacceptable that we have statewide officials doing stuff like that.

For more context he was one of the republicans Abbott endorsed primary challengers against because they refused to take tax funds from our severely underfunded public schools (among the lowest per student spending in the country) and give it away to rich private school owners. And Sid Miller (ag commissioner) ran an awful ad against them

📢  Over 1MIL voters were recently scrubbed from the TX voter rolls (including my sibling)!

If you check and your "Voter Status" says SUSPENSE (see screenshot attached): you CAN still vote!

FYI: You will be pulled aside to fill out a form (bring proof of residence as a backup), or they can have you fill out a provisional ballot.

Content: How do I register to vote?

There are several options to submit a last-minute application by the deadline:

Visit the voter registrar office in your county (find yours here)
Register through a volunteer deputy voter registrar (organizations like local chapters of the League of Women Voters often hold voter registration events)
Mail the application to the voter registrar in your county
If you decide to mail an application, it must be postmarked by the Oct. 7 deadline for you to vote in the Nov. 5 election. You can request the postmark through employees at your local post office. Applications left in mailboxes or mail drop off boxes may not always be postmarked that same day.

You can find an application at county voter registrars’ offices and some post offices, government offices, or high schools. You can also print out the online application and mail it to the voter registrar in your county. This will require an envelope and postage like regular mail. Download your application here.

Content: Following up to my own question - I called the Secretary of State (the number I found on votetexas) and was sent to the elections dept of my mom's county where I was told that only the last/married name was required and to not include the maiden name at all. The clerk even looked up my mom's voter registration to double check and said it was okay to exclude the maiden name. So, the more we know. 🌈 💫

The Supreme Court has kept in place a decision by the 5th circuit that  blocks Biden Administration guidance that said hospitals had to provide abortions to patients in medical distress. Paxton sued.

Content: It’s great that you are wanting to encourage others! You are representing so that is the first step. Next steps would be to find out what your peers do care about.  Where do they see themselves next year? What do they want their life to be like when they turn 21- whoever we elect this year will still be president then. WHO do they care about? WHO do they see as worth caring for? They might not care about politics, but to (mis)quote Tim Walz, it sure cares about them.  You can ignore climate change, but it won’t ignore you. You can not care about health care for yourself when you’re young, but what if someone you love gets sick? What kind of air do they want to breathe, clean or polluted? What would they want to happen to their mom if she miscarried and couldn’t get health care? Politics is personal. So listen to their concerns, and explain why voting makes a difference on a personal, day to day level. Politics the word is based on policy - laws and budgets that affect everyone. Do you let someone else decide what’s best for you or do you find out what your generation wants and have your voice? 
That’s my best mom advice, Malachi. And Im proud of you for being willing to give yourself to this cause!!!

Content: With that, even better news for everyone who's been asking about STATEWIDE efforts to Get Out The Vote!  
*PLEASE SHARE* to anyone interested - I just hosted the KICKOFF calls last night!

Texas Democrats are working to beat Ted Cruz & get downballot Dems elected! You can make a HUGE impact for TX GOTV outreach by joining our statewide virtual phonebanks on Zoom. We have multiple 2-hour shifts every week until Election Day, with a brief training at the start of each session - new phonebankers welcome! 
Tues-Thurs: 5pm, 7pm 
Sat: 9am, 12pm, 3pm 
Sun: 12pm, 3pm 

Sign up via links below - all you need is your Zoom login, a laptop or tablet, and your phone. THANK YOU!  
 
PS - Studies have shown that phone banking is one of THE most effective ways to GOTV, with a 3.8% increase in turnout - when most swing states are decided by 1% of the vote or less! So by joining our virtual phone bank, you are maximizing your impact for Texas!

WEEK ONE    - links change weekly, feel free to dm if you want to sign up for multiple weeks!

Content: If anyone here lives in Tarrant County, please vote out the far-right commissioners this November. We cannot continue to have a far-right government suppressing the vote in such a large county (Texas tribune has a good article on county judge Tim O’Hare, which I’m not sure if I want to post because of how awful the things he’s said and done are)

Content: **GOOD EVENING ALL**! 👋  i've been in the channel here and there *unofficially* but haven't __formally__ introduced myself as the Deputy State Director for the Harris-Walz campaign in Texas  🎉   looking forward to getting to know everyone!  also wanted to share some exciting updates:
1. in addition to directing folks to http://go.kamalaharris.com as a resource for **brand new** volunteers, 
2. we also have a **TX-specific one-pager** with more localized information here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zFmKx0TywaLTYdloHLn-SZe0Y930uLiJWjHNG2USw90
3. you can now **create your own phonebanks w/ TX-flavored branding** 🙂 https://events.democrats.org/c/host-a-phonebank-texas/event/create/

also happy to 1:1 with anyone who wants to chat about the next 22 (almost 21) days! feel free to DM me 🤗

Content: oop I was offline - but as <@623298709530214412> said! (We actually - unknowingly lol - ran into each other at the Emhoff rally!)

It's actually been super interesting, there's def parts of SA that are deep blue, but even in the N outskirts that were SUPER MAGA even 4yrs ago, you hardly see any GOP signs! And in so many blockwalks and calls that I've made, there are lots of GOP/Conservatives who are just fed up with Cruz and their party and are voting Democrat!

Content: Hey <#1268378299428634727> ! Now that you watched the big Senate Debate, I really hope you'll join me and other Texas Democrats in our statewide phonebanks to talk to as many TX voters as possible before Election Day! We know this is gonna be a tight race, with national impact, so we need as MANY volunteers as we can get to TURN TEXAS BLUE!!

We have shifts Tues-Thurs evenings and Sat/Sun throughout the day. Find all the phonebank info and signup links per week here: [Calls For Colin](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uf9a-DN720GRs27EFfEiT0QqzPIFjtLJtv47g08Y7a8/edit?usp=sharing)  - and THANK YOU!!

Content: Hey friends, looks like Allred did a number on Cruz at yesterday's debate. Have seen a number of posts about it on Reddit today, like this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1g4n7on/texans_please_put_him_to_bed/. If folks here are interested in making sure that the message gets across to the Reddit community as much as possible, give a shout and we in the <#1288163431911788586> can help you -- we have a subreddit list and a bunch of context now about how different subreddits operate. After all, we need a helpful Senate for H/W to pass their agenda!

Content: Another one with +3 million followers, top of the page. Just listened to the debate -- Ted Cruz sounded nervous. Very grabby with his time. Got shrill at points. Allred was steady and cool—really happy for him, he didn't flinch.

Content: Just got home from an appt & decided to take a Lyft instead of driving my car.  My Lyft driver had MSNBC playing on his car radio.  Said he gets a lot of feedback from customers.  Especially today after Debate last night.  Overwhelming support for Allred/Harris/Walz.  Oh he voted for dump in 2016 but said he is a Never Trumper now & Voting Democrat.  Of course I gave him a big tip!!!💙🇺🇲✊

Content: Personally I would be kind of surprised. The only time I can recall her coming here is to accept a union endorsement in Houston. She’s really busy and has a lot of other places to be, not only for the campaign but also for her duties as VP. I know Doug’s been here a few times and I wouldn’t be that surprised if another major surrogate like Bill Clinton (who had the best performances in the state since the last time a Democratic Presidential Candidate won it (Carter in 1976), losing by less than 5% in each of his 2 elections). He did better than any democratic candidate since then has in the rural south, though I’m not sure how much of that appeal he still holds since Hillary didn’t do too well.

Surrogates are an issue here though since the last democratic officeholders left office in 1999, so most are either very old or dead.

Content: But because of how many people have been born and died in the past 34 years a lot (maybe even a majority) of people in Texas were not even alive when she was elected. 34 years is a pretty long time (much longer than I’ve been alive)

Content: From what I remember of Ann Richards as a youth, it was 1988-94, so this was likely 80s. I am listening to a live Zoom right now, so I cannot listen to the audio of the video.  Ann Richards was a legend and her daughter Cecile is a leader in the PAC area, formerly National at Planned Parenthood. Thanks y'all.

Content: I had to get through the paywall, but here are the takeaways:
- Texas added nearly 200k voters in the two weeks before the deadline 
- Since 2016, when Donald Trump first won Texas, the state has added 3.5 million voters (equivalent of Wisconsin’s entire voting population!!) 
- Since 2020, state population growth is about 1.6%
- Texas is adding voters at a 10% increase and includes those turning 18, transplants from other states, aggressive registration efforts by partisan and non-partisan groups
- 2020 Biden vs Trump was the closest race in Texas in almost 30 years and the 9th closest in the country
- Fastest voter registration growth by county since 2020: Harris (over 200k) and Bexar (106k)

Content: Please help I have been recovering from surgery due to an accident in July.  I walked with a cane now. Prolonged standing is very painful.  Do you know if there is an express line for disability? I know there are drive through lines but Texas Republicans have made very few of those and the lines can be hours long from what I have read in the news in the past.  But NOTHING not even my Pain will stop me from casting my Vote that's for sure!💙🇺🇲✊

Content: From the vote Texas website-

Curbside Voting

If a voter is physically unable to enter the polling place, he or she may ask that an election officer bring a ballot to the entrance of the polling place or to a car parked at the curbside. After the voter marks the ballot, they will give it to the election officer, who will put it in the ballot box. Or, at the voter’s request, a companion may hand the voter a ballot and deposit it for him or her.

Content: Hello! This is unrelated to voting, but I thought may be helpful. I was the same with prolonged standing and only had a cane for a long time. I found that if I was going somewhere where I knew there was little seating or I was going to be standing for a period of time I knew would be difficult, a rollator really helped. They're a little clunky get in and out of trunks, but the built in seat was a lifesaver when I needed it. ❤️

Content: I have made a song with AI to encourage those citizens to empower themselves and vote no matter what. I’m about to screen record it, make a Tik Tok with Kamala’s famous She Podemos and post it here. I want as many people as possible to share it when it is out. The new sensational song needs to gain momentum tomorrow and spread into Florida to magnify the voters that Trump disrespected so badly in Univision.

Content: 💙 HAPPY EARLY VOTING, TX! 💙 🎉

Remember, you CANNOT use your phone while voting! So to avoid last-minute confusion/forgetfulness (like me 😅), come prepared: https://www.vote411.org/ballot puts out a nonpartisan Voter's Guide where they ask candidates the same questions.

This is what it looks like via mobile - easier via laptop - you can get a personalized list of your ballot races with: office descriptions, campaign finances, what (if) candidates answer, and mark your choices to print / take with you.

(They've made scrolling on your phone easier but... I have 40 races on my ballot. Save yourself & scroll via laptop lol!)

Last thing: Most locations are open 8am-6pm week 1, but hours vary. You can do Early Voting at any location in your county - hours & voting FAQs here: https://www.VoteTexas.gov

Content: A very reliable, good friend of mine just finished pollworker training and she texted me this.....Just finished Poll Manager training! I passed all the classes. I want you all to know something...if you are checking in at the polls and they happen to write anything on your ballot before they give it to you to put in the voting machine...a letter, a checkmark, a star, an R or a D any writing of any kind...please request a new ballot. Your ballot could be disqualified if it is written on. Please be on the lookout for this type of behavior.

Content: Just a pro-tip if you are in Collin County. 
In 2022, the library/courthouse in Melissa was a very fast process and short line for voting. 
Even if there are a bunch of people out for early voting, I can’t imagine a ton of people in Anna or Melissa being out since they’re smaller areas. 

Also, the Frisco Fire Station off of Rolater Rd was also pretty easy in 2020, although a bit busier.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: Just spent like 15 minutes exploring what a hypothetical democratic win in Texas could look like out of curiousity (thinking about it since I’m about to go vote). I just took the 2016-2020 swings from NYT for the counties containing major cities and their suburbs (since that’s where most of the votes will come from) and multiplied them by 1.647 (1.647 * 3.4 (2016-2020 swing) = 5.6 (Trump’s 2020 margin), then added them to Biden’s 2020 share (cnn). Didn’t want to spend too long on a hypothetical so I didn’t use super precise numbers and didn’t consider population changes (which means the necessary vote shares will be lower). The third party vote share will likely also be different, but it’ll be a lot easier to look for a percentage than a margin.

Dallas - 69.8% Harris
Tarrant- 56.9% Harris
Denton- 55% Harris (flip)
Collin- 57.7% Harris (flip)
Williamson- 57.9% Harris
Travis- 76.6% Harris
Hays- 64.3% Harris
Bexar- 62.4% Harris
Harris- 57.1% Harris
Ft Bend- 58.5% Harris
Montgomery- 32.9% Harris
 
Deviations in larger counties will have a larger effect. Putting them here in case anyone wants them and so I can find them easily. Someone else has probably done a more detailed analysis somewhere, but I haven’t seen it.

Content: Got my plan ready. 
Registration active, checked constantly until the last day to make sure I didn’t get purged. 
Have a doctor’s appointment on 11/1, so I’m going to go afterwards. 
Took off the entire day. 
And the day after Election Day. 
I intend on being up all night with copious amounts of alcohol and Xanax on deck. 😂

Content: I've had several conversations like that <@161475441654235136> ! I've been canvassing and calling some pretty red areas around my city and TX in general. We definitely want to encourage ANY voter who wants to vote their conscience or for the good of the (country/state) over party!

They don't have to vote straight Democrat if they don't believe in that. But EVERY vote to get Ted Cruz out of office / keep Trump out counts, especially from the MANY Republicans or Conservatives who agree that he is no good for Texas! 

I would *highly* recommend they look into getting a personalized sample ballot from www.vote411.org/ballot - it provides a non-partisan voter guide where you can compare candidates' responses to standardized questions side-by-side and make their own decisions.

Content: Just voted! Had like 2 hours blocked off but the line was less than 10 minutes. Not sure how to feel about that. On one hand I got to vote pretty fast but on the other hand I’m worried about low turnout among college students (basically the only people who use the station I went to)

Content: It does help.. and I'm certain he would NOT vote for Ted Cruz other than he doesn't want Democrat control of both White House and Senate... I would love to get Cruz out of office as well, but keeping Trump out of the WH is higher priority I suppose.  I just wasn't sure if there was a good answer, other than I didn't think the Senate would stay blue with or without Cruz, the numbers are against Democrats this go-round.  Anyway, at least he isn't and never will be a vote for Trump and will be a vote for Harris/Walz, and believe me, we are all in the minority in Burleson, TX workplace (those of us not stumping for Trump) so I will take what I can get!!

Content: Just letting yall know they have not allowed some of our smaller Texas towns to open early voting this year. Which is hurting alot of folks abilities to get to the polls. Mart said they just were not doing any early voting, and they do not know if they will have a voting center open on Nov 5th. Unfortunately our next closest voting center is 30 minutes away.

Content: Whoever is in charge of setting up the voting centers. The lady at the school admin building didn't give any names, just said they were not approved to open early voting in Mart TX. They did have early voting for the 2020 election. So when I scooped up some folks to go by and saw the building closed (even tho it shows it is a early voting site on the website) I called the Mart ISD administration where the voting is normally held, and that's what the lady told me.

Content: All good. Not gonna stop me lol I'm still gonna go vote, but now I gotta bus more folks out there than I had originally thought x x I have a sub compact so I'm gonna be making a few trips out there. All for the cause though. Just wanted to drop this information here incase other folks from the outskirts of Mclennan county couldn't find out what the deal was with our voting out here.

Content: DFW is a bit over 1/4 of Texas’s population if you include some rural counties. With those 4 it should be about a fourth. 4*189053 (numbers from Stephen Dial, who works for the local Fox affiliate) = 756212.

Content: Democrats can win keep hold of the senate as long as they nominate good candidates. Good candidates beat republicans 75% of the time if you look at the Likely Tossup seats. The only reason why they are losing this time is due to the fact the only tossup seats are solid red seats and it’s a POTUS election

Content: I wonder if the polls are including these almost 700k voters who may be pivotal.

I really don’t see any TX Biden 2020 voters not showing up for Harris. However, I could see a loss of support for Cruz/Trump voters. It just really depends on the amount.

Content: Depends on when they registered and if they respond. If they didn’t register until like right before the deadline they may not be in there since polls usually come out like a week or so after they survey people

Content: Yea. I think if the Harris campaign has resources to get out the vote in TX as well, it could prove to be an immense reward. Maybe in the final couple days before the election.

Content: One thing I'm not seeing talk about, and I guess we'll never know, is the impact Covid had on the voting population. We recently surpassed 1.2 million deaths in America. Seeing the "low" turnout for Texas on day one has me thinking about that.

Content: It’s beautiful. I feel like they represented the beginning of the end of the Republican chokehold and unitary rule in the south. I love them for that. Even though they lost their races, they’re activating people and making them believe in democracy.

We need more Betos and Staceys in the other southern states, and we will get them.

I swear the south has some of the most suppressed and disgruntled populations, waiting to be activated for change.

Content: i have, and my feedback is: get there early. like _early._ hours early. since it's a Harris rally it's going to be TRIPLE-packed, and they'll probably have to send away people if it gets too full, so the earlier you are the better your odds of getting in

also, bring a handheld fan and snacks.

Content: Hey folks! Thank you for joining us. **Together, we will write the next chapter in the greatest story ever told.**

Phonebanking is our **number one priority** so close to the election, and it’s a phenomenal way to get started. We often set goals for specific numbers, like how we set a goal for 5 million calls this past weekend. We made 4.6 million, reaching immense numbers of people!

We’re 300,000 calls behind our goal for the day, and we urgently need to call Wisconsin voters. Early voting starts today in Wisconsin, and people need voting plans! We’re only **14 days away** from the election!

[Can we count on you to help us? Please, click here to get started and call directly into Wisconsin!](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=32641249-daa7-4253-b97b-df11f362bdb3&ref=go_kh_calls_wi&utm_source=hfp_w_go_calls_20241022&utm_campaign=hfp_w_go_mb_do_vol_vrec_calls_20241022&utm_medium=go_kh_calls_20241022&utm_term=go_kh_calls_20241022)

We know it’s scary for many of you. I have the same anxiety as well. But a second trump administration is much scarier. We can do this!

Content: Since Texas’s population has grown, I would expect there to be more votes even if the % turnout stays the same. But since other states are also breaking their records, turnout should be higher than 2020. A quick google search shows 2020 turnout was 66.8% so I think turnout this year may be like 75%

Content: I feel like turnout is also just people finally caring about voting (no matter what party they vote for) and they now know their vote matters (since the 2016 fiasco into 2020 with Georgia flipping). Couple that with the mid to late Gen 18-21 year olds that can vote now turnout is spiking in so many states!
