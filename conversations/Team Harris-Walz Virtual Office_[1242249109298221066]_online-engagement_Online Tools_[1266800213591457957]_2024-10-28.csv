Like Christian said, in this program we use Reach which the campagin and the DNC use to provide us with the content to push and Discord which is the ""field office"" if you will."

Iâ€™m up and running with both Reach and Discord. Will try to get my first canvassing done in the upcoming week. I will coordinate with one of my local field offices on training and mapping out a territory by my house to get things rolling."
