Content: Hello everyone. I am a New Yorker in a safe blue area who is determined to help ensure Pennsylvania goes for Harris.

I‚Äôve taken off the long weekend  through election day for GOTV efforts and have freed myself up for other trips to canvass, register voters, etc, I am just deciding on where to go and where my efforts can be most impactful.

If you have any advice, I would love to hear it!

Content: An extreme swing county. It's so bad that the Ashley Ehaz Campaign is desperately looking for phone bank people. I was doing it but I'm starting to train for the DNC's Vote Team so I don't know how much of a commitment I can do. If anyone wants info on the campaign's phonebanks, DM me.

Content: Don't we all? I live two towns over from where his family grew up and I can tell you he's not a good person. Rarely shows up at events and when he does virtual town halls, if you comment with something that he doesn't agree with, they boot you out. The only reason why this guy got noticed in the first place is his late brother was the Congressman before him and to be honest, I liked his brother more than him because at least his brother showed up at things.

Content: My county is heavily republican and there are some old 2020 trump/pence signs still hanging around, but haven't seen much of any. Perhaps it's too early. I do recall a lot of Fetterman signs and Shapiro at this time of year. We're very rural, so not much vandalism as so much as just not as many democrats lol

Content: I was on Bristol-Oxford Valley Road in Middletown Township (the part that's considered Levittown) and saw this Trump flag in this one dude's yard and was so repulsed until I drove further down the road and saw someone put a pink flag on their fence which said, "Kamala Harris 2024...A Woman's Place is in the White House."

Content: I thought I'd mention of an opportunity for everyone to canvass in Bucks County. This is PA-01 which is currently represented in Congress by Brian Fitzpatrick who claims to be a progressive/independent Republican but he is not.  These three links are for Bensalem (which will also cover Bristol), Newtown, and Falls which are in the lower part of Bucks County.

Content: Also, if you want to find out about more opportunities, fill out this Mobilize link. We have three US Congressional seats in PA that are in desperate need to be kept blue  and two that need to be flipped. Bob Casey needs to be reelected, the PA House needs to stay blue and the Senate needs to be flipped. Also 19 electoral votes. Biden won PA by a little over 80K votes in 2020 and HRC lost PA in 2016 by less than 1% so we really are the Keystone State. https://www.mobilize.us/padems/event/612027/

It's actually how I got my start as a phone bank facilitator and now I do them on the national level but I know the crew that works the state level phone banks is still stellar since a few of them are from my old team in 2022. https://www.mobilize.us/padems/?event_type=2&org_ids=37374

Content: Hello PA!! I was wondering if there are any initiatives happening in PA with college students- specifically with registering students to vote (most should be eligible to vote in PA by November I think) and/or targeting PA students attending college out of state with how to request absentee ballots? That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd really like to volunteer my time!

Content: I agree! In my mind it‚Äôs like we need a really excellent social media campaign that goes state by state using this info and gets to all the college groups so they can reuse. AND if we were able to target PA students attending school out of state who could get an absentee ballot that seems like another untapped population

Content: The voter registration thing is over saturated in Pittsburgh. I was paid to be a voter canvasser. But they want 10 sign ups per outing. It‚Äôs a neat idea what you‚Äôre saying but the Outreach team of the Dem Party has people all over the city doing canvassing. And they get paid for their time. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not important, I just want to understand how this would be this be different? I want to help though. The thing I didn‚Äôt enjoy about being paid to go out was there was pressure to meet quotas. And you had to be out there for 7 hours walking around wherever we were targeting. I need a no pressure situation and dedicate like 3-4 hours. Beyond that, I‚Äôm pushing my body too far.

Content: The biggest stumbling block I'm running into is WHERE to have people meet to gather / sign in / get a short training? FT6 suggests a coffee shop and then do the training basically outside in the parking lot or someting which seems really uncomfortable to me. I've been scouting out some other places like maybe the Mt. Lebanon city skate center next to the high school where they have some rooms to rent and plenty of parking? Have people gather, have some coffee and snacks to take with them, do the training and then send them out to the locations?

Content: I agree. You have to do training session. I didn‚Äôt realize this was walking around thing. Very much so. I guess I was picturing  you talking about just set up a table, but that‚Äôs not as effective as actually going up and talking to others. In 7 hours I spoke with at least 100 people. If we do half that time it would be good to do at least engage with 50. That was only to get 2 signatures.

Content: Yeah FT6 discourages using a table and suggests going to places like college campuses and court houses with 2 or 3 people just walking around. But their documentation says that like 1-4 signups (per person) per session is great and 5 is huge, just to give context about their expectations!

Content: For those doing voter registration, this is probably one of the best times to do it near collge campuses since many are starting to have move-in days right about now. I did one around this time in 2022 in Philadelphia on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. Check Mobilize and with local Democratic offices.

Content: People who are registered with the Democratic Party are usually emailed invites to rallies. As for the details about the rally itself, they‚Äôre usually not released until about 24-48 hours beforehand for security purposes.

Content: Hey all! I‚Äôm the gal Evan mentioned above! I was advised to post here. Oftentimes the rallies/tickets are announced last second for security reasons, and sell out fast. Because I‚Äôm in Ohio, right near the border, I won‚Äôt have a heads up from local reps etc. I know this is a huge favor to ask, but if anyone is located in Pittsburgh and gets wind of how to attend as soon as that info comes out, could you please please relay that info to me so I can try to reserve seats? This particular rally is important to me for various reasons, and I‚Äôve saved up for it, but didn‚Äôt realize it‚Äôd be so hard to get in

Content: I did a phone bank last week and I talked to a couple of people in the middle of the state. One man, who talked my ear off for 40 mins because he was just so happy to talk to someone who shared his politics, as he lives in a red area, and his kids married staunch republicans. Lol. He was really upset about that. But he said that there are a lot less Trump signs around this cycle, which is a sign, I think, that voters can be swayed if we just talk to them -- actually, not so much talk as LISTEN. Then ask questions. And listen some more.

Content: I also talked to three separate women who were Dems but refused to vote for Kamala, "because I just don't like her, there's something about her I don't trust."  I'm not sure how to address that, seems like a bias.

Content: Hopefully this is a good sign...no pun intended. I saw polls on social media saying she's taking a bigger lead but as someone who worked as a field volunteer, I can tell you that one can't solely go by these things alone. We made that mistake in 2016 and look what happened.

I am in VA and volunteered to canvass in PA- my sister is there and I spent was early teen through college years there.    
I saw advertisements around visiting college campuses to distribute literature and register voters, etc.   
I would love to do that. I currently work for JMU- a VA University. 
There is a Community College close to my sister‚Äôs. 
How might I find out about doing this, please??
Many thanks!! üíôüíôüíôüíô

Content: Hi Joy! If you visit mobilize.us, you can often find in-person events in your area & surrounding areas that involve engaging younger voters at college campuses, registering them to vote, etc. 

Along with mobilize.us, you can also volunteer to phone bank and text bank with us to engage with voters of all demographics as well. Thanks for joining in on the fight with us! üíô

Content: Because we have this info which is all we could find that might identify where dems will be gathering: Downtown streets close at 10 AM
11 am-1 pm Parade passes by Reviewing Stand & City Dem Gathering
Stanwix Street and Blvd of the Allies

BE THERE! Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be in Pittsburgh on Labor Day! The Pgh Dems (City Dem Committee) invites committee members and friends from across the city to gather at the corner of Stanwix and Blvd of the Allies across from the reviewing stand to cheer on Dem Office holders and candidates and our labor union friends. And we might even see Joe and Kamala in the viewing stands.

Content: I feel like ever since that assassination attempt on Trump, security for rallies has really beefed up. (Which is a good thing, considering how tense the political climate is right now).

Content: Hi <#1268378088069267456> , excited to land here, after my "how to get involved in the campaign" training! I live out of state but am considering spending some time with family in Philly so I can canvass for the campaign. It looks like there is an office on Chelton Ave (in Germantown) that would be accessible for me to get to. Does anyone know if there is a phone number for the office that I can call or If I will be able to walk in to find a buddy and start canvassing in the area? (My main concern is I do not have a car when I am visitting but the Chelton Ave location looks accessible.) Any advice / Suggestions?

Content: I used to also have to run staging locations in 2022 and I always emailed the volunteers who signed up and gave them my number saying if they had questions, to call or text me. I will tell you that Field Organizers do make it very easy for you to contact them once you sign up for a shift. I still keep in touch with a couple of former ones from '22, to be honest.

Content: No problem. I was a field volunteer from 2016-2022 and I would have been this time around if it weren't for the fact that I messed up my knee so bad that the only surgical option is joint replacement and the doctor said I'm not a good canidate on account of age...I'm too young. It's a good way to get in the door for future work though.

Content: <@746403830073262152> I truly love your point about listening and asking questions. it is so fascinating to learn from people with different worldviews and find the common ground. I read a book called "Never Split the Difference" by Chris Voss, a former hostage negotiator and he talks all about "tactical empathy", listening, mirroring, summarizing what the other person is telling you and clarifying that you got their point right" instead of knee jerk reacting which I hopefully have learned to do less of ! 8)

Content: Hi... Not sure who to ask: can I get the phone number of the HQ in Stroudsburg? I'm driving there (from MA -- a six hour drive) on Friday the 13th and staying until lunch time on Sunday, to knock on doors. I don't remember who I spoke with but they assured me there would be some training and someone to go out with on Friday afternoon. I'm signed up for two shifts on Saturday already, but would also like to go out Sunday morning if possible. Thanks!

Content: Hi Lola, here are a number of events in Germantown. It is best to register through Mobilize. Once you are looped into a field office and attend an event, it is easy to sign up for future events. https://www.mobilize.us/padems/?q=Germantown

Does that mean we have to volunteer in person in one of those cities? I would love to volunteer in Pennsylvania, but Pittsburgh is too far west for me.

Content: I‚Äôm a woman in NY near the PA border and my friends and I are planning a couple day trips to PA to place post-it notes ‚Äúwoman to woman your vote is private‚Äù in women‚Äôs public restrooms. I‚Äôd like to go to counties within an hour or so of Binghamton/interstate 81 that we have a good chance of flipping. We have friends in the area and are mindful of safety issues that may arise. I‚Äôd appreciate any guidance anyone may have!

Content: I think you're insinuating that wasn't a good day but 3 out of 4 hadn't ever registered ~~volunteers~~ voters before so I'm pretty happy with it! Most of the kids did not want to talk to us and those that did either told us they were already registered or not U.S. citizens.

Content: Not sure what you mean by a list of how many unregistereds are up for grabs but this was a volunteer drive I set up ‚Äì not by the Democratic Party, which told me they're not looking for this kind of help ‚Äì using information from Field Team 6. They did not provide any data for us but suggested hotspots to go to. Three of us went to CMU and 1 went to a couple local businesses based on those suggestions.

Content: Hi all: Heads-up that he's spreading Big Lie 2.0 about voting in PA even before voting apparently begins. https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/1fcf98z/not_one_single_vote_has_been_cast_hes_at_it_again/. Sharing in case people you talk to ask about this‚Äîyou'll know where it comes from.

Content: Haven't seen any. Check back often because with vote by mail in PA, GOTV is pretty much a "round the clock" thing with most organizers. Speaking from eight years experience which included several years of field work. And VBM ballot requests will be starting soon...found out from my friends who work phone banks for PA Dems Voter Protection.

Content: Hi Glad, Thank you for reaching out and wanting to direct your efforts to PA. I would recommend a couple of ways: 

1 - Take part in a REACH training. This is ideal for folks who have connections to swing states (really anyone... but for the swing states, this is more effective than post cards and letters).  https://events.democrats.org/event/597624/
2 - If you are able to GET to PA for a weekend, do some canvassing
3 - Sign up for Phone Banking https://www.mobilize.us/padems/?event_type=2

Content: Hey everyone, I'm Mike from Montgomery County outside Philly. I'm new to political campaigns and am really worried about Trump getting back in power. I want to do everything I can to prevent that. I'm excited about Kamala's chances and want to help.

I've noticed a lack of yard signs for Harris/Walz in my area, and it's been bugging me to see mostly trump signs going up. I'm thinking of ordering 100-500 signs to put up around Lansdale (Hatfield, Skippack, Blue Bell, Montgomeryville). I have no experience with this and would need people to take care of everything other than getting the signs.

I'm looking to gauge interest and thoughts on whether it's a good idea. I've heard signs aren't that effective, but it really does bug me. It just doesn't look great at this point.

Content: You can print signs from the link: https://store.kamalaharris.com/harris-walz-yard-signs-digital-download/. Also, the best way to get involved in my experience is to knock on doors or phone bank especially in a swing state.

Content: Mike I'm in your area and happy to help, but unfortunately you can only place them in your own yard. You could set up a table or something up in a high traffic area (the mall, library, etc - with permission) and talk to people about the Harris campaign and offer one sign each if they want it. This will hopefully get more signs up in your area AND possibly inform/mobilize people to vote Harris in Nov.  I'm happy to help!

Content: There is the link to lawn signs along PA roads. I believe you can put them up other places with permits (contact local gov or as Angelina said, local dems) to find out the specifics.

Content: Yes see where your local campaign office is and see if they have lawn signs, I just picked up a few today from my local place!  (They did say though that they do not have a lot and are really only giving them out to folks who are volunteering while they have limited supplies)

Content: Kriten, that makes sense, I'm sure there's a lot more demand than supply right now. To be clear, I'm not looking to get my hands on one or two signs. I want to order 300 or so custom-printed signs and get them distributed in my area. I've emailed the county office and will call on Monday (no one answered when I called today) and will be contacting other local Dem groups too.

Content: I attended a Reproductive Rights rally that Gov. Shapiro and Hadley Duvall were headlining in Philly today. The energy was great! Volunteers from the PA Democratic Party were asking people if they would like to volunteer and they had a lot of positive responses.

Content: hi all, I arrived in Bradford co PA this weekend, a deeply red county - happy that I have seen many fewer Trump signs than in the recent past - our immediate neighbor no longer has the entire side of her barn advertising the orange monster - it is a freshly painted gray!  And my mom's book club is going to do a chunk of my postcards today! Small wins & a wonderful start to the week!

Content: Hi everyone, I hope this is a good place to ask about this. I live in central NJ, and I'd be interested in writing postcards for Matt Cartwright or Susan Wild, or both, and I'd be fine with coming to pick them up. I am also happy to mail them in nearby PA. I've left email and phone messages for both campaigns, but haven't heard anything back, and I've also looked on mobilize and found nothing. I did this two years ago; doesn't anyone know whether it's something they want help with now, and if it is, how to get involved? Thanks!

Bob Casey likely could really use help too. HIs opponent has name recognition and I probably get 2 fliers for him per week.

I assume I'll be able to find a weekend canvass near Allentown, where I'll be on Sat-Sun the 12-13. How can I get in touch with organizers in Pittsburgh, where I'll be Mon-Tues the 14-15?

Content: I think if you go to kamalaharris.com and filter volunteer opportunities within a few miles of Allentown, you may find what you're looking for. You can also go to PADEM.org the state Dem Party will also have volunteer opportunities. If you register at both sites, you will receive emails updating you with new info

Content: <@1277610022247071764> i know the Allentown and Bethlehem office will give out canvassing lists in days other than the canvassing event days. I assume the others do as well.  It takes a little searching to find the location of the offices in a given area

Content: Talk to an organizer. The reason why I'm saying this is because I remember a woman who used to do this. Start with contacting a county party office. They might know of a contact.

Content: Looks like the nearest one is in Wayne. I searched for events around KOP and found canvassing locations with a launch point of Wayne. I'm not 100% familiar with the area since I'm in Bucks County but I'm sure if you click the link and do a new search, you can find information. https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/664893/

Content: I had to look up why and it doesn't shock me. Mostly red county. Sadly, we see that a lot in PA. It's why we're so purple. Also, Anthony is right about the voting laws.

Content: You had that issue too? My VBM ballot got lost in the mail the last time. Thankfully I'm in more purple Bucks County and was told if I went to the satelite office that the county had a town over from me, they would print me out a new one. They even had a drop box for me to put it in.

Content: In the article that started this, the city manager talks about how she cannot ensure there is video surveillance and round the clock security around the mailboxes which can only come from right wing provisions in the voting laws such that if the manager did allow the voting boxes, the county could be sued and potentially have the mail in ballots thrown out by a PA Supreme Court that is anyone‚Äôs guess in terms of how they would rule in a case like that

Content: Which is weird because where I live the drop boxes are either in a county building or their in a place like a police station. For instance where I live in Bucks County I could go to the satellite office for my County government services or I could take it to a Dropbox that's right in the town hall where the police station for my town is. That's really weird but that's Pennsylvania for you.

Content: Okay thanks for letting me know. Like I said I don't really know that area too well because I'm originally from Southern New Jersey for one and for another while I live near Philadelphia I'm in lower Bucks County so I'm more familiar with that area and Northeast Philly.

Content: To be honest, most of the mail issues are also because of what the postmaster general has done. I found this out from a friend in Georgia who told me that they've experienced the same issues and it was so bad that even mail that was not election related has had issues.

Content: I would point to her policies about taxes or prices:
* H/W's /issues page states that no one making more than $400K will pay more taxes. In contrast, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center (to name one such group opposing Trumponomics 2024) says Trump's plan to make his earlier tax cuts (for rich people) would increase the national debt by more than $4 trillion over the next 10 years, and *increase* taxes for 13% of middle-income Americans. 
* On prices, the H/W agenda calls out "anti-competitive practices that let big corporations jack up prices and undermine the competition." This is where the issues lie‚Äîcorporate greed. In general I have been really excited to hear both H and W talk about shifting some of the power away from corporations and back to workers. Like, they spend a *lot* of time on it. Also: Walz is not rich‚Äîhe doesn't even own stock‚Äîso he likely goes to the supermarket himself sometimes and knows first-hand. 

Personally neither of the above is my #1 reason for backing H/W‚Äîmy top reasons are "won't sell out to dictators" and "won't become a dictator"‚Äîbut I thought about what my Western PA dad would complain about.

Content: I know Harris supporters have done that in some places. I'm actually hoping they do that again somewhere in Bucks County since I loved when a bunch of them drove past a canvas launch site in Bensalem in 2020 with Biden signs.

Content: Just so everyone knows, you can apply for a vote by mail ballot now. Use the links Jack mentioned. The ballots will start hitting mail boxes around October so check with your county. PS. If you live in Bucks County, they start mailing out in mid-October.

Content: I know also in PA, the only time you're really asked for ID is when it's your first time voting in any precinct, and it can be as simple as a piece of mail addressed to you, however, Jack is right about the rest of that stuff. Another pro-tip, if you're going to your election office to get an on-demand VBM (vote by mail) ballot, I find showing them ID helps find you quicker when you hand them the paperwork.

Content: I'm a CA resident that is interested in moving to PA for the final month of the campaign to help organize. I can pay my own way to get to wherever I will be most helpful to the campaign, but I was hoping there might be another volunteer or member of the campaign that has a spare room that I could stay at while I volunteer. Please let me know (in DMs) if anyone can help connect me with the right person!

Content: Hello All!  I'm an OR resident coming to Pittsburgh from 10/3-10/21, to help with the campaign. I am available to volunteer full time, 40+ hours a week for the 3 weeks I am there.  I recently retired from a middle management "Big 5" corporate job, so have lots of skills and am ready to be put to work.  I will also have a car.  Who can I reach out to get involved?  <@1260983976483356767> or <@941196169852366859> - I signed up for slack.  Please feel free to PM me.  I am happy to sign up on Mobilize, however, that seems for more 1 off opportunities.  Didn't know if having someone dedicated for 3 weeks straight could be used for other things?  Please let me know.  Thanks!

Content: Not sure where to post this - so starting in this thread. I assume you are aware, but re-stating it since I just experienced it this weekend while travelling to PA as an out of state volunteer.     Trump direct, or a superpac  is flooding the highways w/large digital signs in PA.  You literally can't drive around Reading and southeast PA w/o seeing them all the time.   Happy to share photos I took while driving.. they were so present.  Ones I saw   in the Reading, and SE PA area ( Rt 12 in Reading and 100/202 routes coming into PA from DE.  )   Its troubling,  - we might see a few hundred folks at any given local event, while thousands of (assuming  low information, hard to reach ?) voters are seeing these signs as they drive around the swing states.      Thoughts?

Content: I agree, it's troubling. I'm in MontCo and can't say I've seen any but then I haven't been on many highways lately. Not sure what can be done about it. You could try contacting the Harris campaign from here: https://kamalaharris.com/contact-us/.  Or send an email to campaign manager Julie Rodr√≠guez (I can DM you her email address if you want). It might also be a good idea to contact the Lincoln Project. They've been putting up some really great billboards around the country. Also, George Conway paid to have one put up in Mar a Lago this past spring to troll trump. Couldn't hurt to reach out and see if he'd be interested in doing something in and around Philly. I'd love to see a handful of billboards along the very busy section of the PA turnpike in MontCo/Bucks.

Content: And there's the Mad Dog PAC too‚Äînot linking due to campaign finance laws, but their website shows some of their billboards: "Trump Killed Border Security," "Trump will gut your social security," etc. They aren't afraid to make it spicy.

Content: Spicy works best. The one George Conway put up earlier this year right near trump's resort said "Vote for Joe, Not the Psycho". I think "Voting Removes Tough Orange Stains" and "Grab Him By the Ballot" would make nice billboards.

Content: This is also why during the primary I went to check my VBM  ballot status, saw i wasn't recorded and called my county voter office because I knew I returned it. Thankfully a nice lady at the Bucks County Voter office was able to find that it was recorded but someone forgot to mark it in the database. Don't ask me how it happened but it happened.

In 2022 all the candidates I canvased for won as well.  It‚Äôs a privileged position to be able to relocate but can be meaningful.  (Just don‚Äôt be fraudulent/disengenuous about moving‚Ä¶ really do it)

Content: Yeah we see the billboards in western PA.  All I‚Äôve seen are digital and the colors/brightness is really harsh on the eyes.  Maybe attention grabbing that way but rather annoying when seeing it a few times.

Content: <@1276396030375624789> I would add this link to that great reference list you have for PA:   Check registration status to be sure it is correct https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx


fwiw I required multiple registration updates to get things in-line for myself (address change& Vote-by-mail, with dmv maybe also impacting).   

I also see strange results for folks I know in the reach App and am contacting them to see what‚Äôs up.

 a couple folks whom thought they registered with clipboard folks on the street but whom did not appear to have achieved registered status  (poll worker got them provisional ballots; especially since they strongly recalled they had registered).

Content: I'm in NY but want to help in PA. Does anyone know if you can join a canvassing in PA if you don't take the organized bus and instead drive yourself there? I'm seeing options to canvass in PA but they all seem to involve taking a bus there with a group, but I'm able to drive and let someone else have the bus seat. Can I still join the canvassing with the bus group?

Content: I just edited response with the mobilize site.  Also go.kamalharris.com and enter a zip code friendly to your driving distance (though I think the zip code filtering is super narrow from my uses and end up broadening to state wide or using 4 zip codes).  

Local campaigns I think have canvassing in other websites but often are in those two.   I‚Äôm no expert but those find me enough things usually‚Ä¶

Content: <@1120639436502355978> I hope you enjoy the watching.  It was memorable for me to be in Ghana during a multiple run-off election (shocking folks had to travel back to their home-region to vote).  Not nearly as visually apparent walking down the street here in the US and beware many folks will have election fatigue by November.  I‚Äôd think your best bet of those locations are in PA for rallies and then election-day events anywhere.  I also really enjoyed a spring/May I spent in the Belgium Pajottenland for lambic and Hallerbos strolls.  (Yeah old person stuffs)   Mobilize.us is best and consider getting involved remotely if possible before hand

But might not wane as quickly for workers at the establishments.l if folks feel emboldened to push conflict based on preconceptions.  

Not loosing any sleep for owners based on what I am aware of at this time.

Content: More importantly in Pittsburgh many groups are canvassing; one headed to in east end (wilkinsburg/swissvale/rankin/braddock).  Near the home of Triangle Bar & Grill a real (football) game day sandwich tradition and small business.   Summer Lee, HW, Bob Casey,  short talk by Adam Schiff & Bob Casey.  I may host a group for Braddock Beers afterwards (also to support a truly local&small business).

Content: Good point on observing polls.   Can also be a poll worker on Election Day and help ensure fair elections and voter access to ballot.  (It can be surprising the number of folks whom are inclined to walk away from polling place at the first sign of uncertainty/delay and that can increase rapidly; part of why phone banking and canvasing gets people there with commitment)   Yes being poll work demands unbiased (non-partisan) while working in the role and may not be for everyone.

I‚Äôd go to individual county‚Äôs election offices where resident to get an assignment&training now, but here is a state wide gateway: https://www.pa.gov/en/services/vote/apply-to-become-an-election-poll-worker.html

Content: Exactly.  Many county workers are poll workers.  In the cases I know they even get paid their normal pay rate not the tiny stipend poll workers receive.   Some buy food for the crew with the stipend so everyone has enough energy to power through at the end of a long long day.

Content: When I was with the county it was totally normal to take a floater, get paid for that, and then get paid for working the polls (and ours isn‚Äôt tiny). So it was kind of double dipping but I asked and it was totally allowed.

Content: Some older voters I spoke to while phone banking stated that only men were supposed to be in positions of authority and they just could not vote for a woman as president (men and women said this). However, they were not voting for Trump. Sooo I changed topic to issues they were concerned about. Healthcare and drug costs were top of mind for them. I was able to persuade a few to Harris ticket due to Medicare negotiations regarding drug costs. Guess their money concerns won over cultural gender issues.

Content: Another issue, I‚Äôm in Chester County and on route 30 everyday I pass by huge Trump billboards and now there is a huge Trump sign right by our police station/East brandywine township office-polling location. Are massive signs allowed at polling locations? It is also in heavy traffic area on Horseshoe pike/322 eastbound.

Content: <@1072639754765615237> - I love your positive outlook, but I know the venue - located in the heart of Reading ,which has a huge Latino population and the gent who posted is very active in the community and fears it will be a major draw.  Hoping the KW campaign follows in the same venue..

Content: I heard about her town hall on Univision and I think that‚Äôs a great idea. I will definitely be watching on Thursday but back to the main point, the Harris campaign should not be ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù on the Hispanic vote. No matter if it‚Äôs Latino men or women, the Harris campaign should be doubling down on their recognition of the Latino vote especially in a swing state like PA, where every vote matters

Content: Thanks for sharing this and yes I am aware that Tim Walz came to Reading a couple days ago and I really appreciated that but it‚Äôs the first time since the Harris campaign started and even since the Biden campaign, that any major candidate on the democratic side of the Presidential ticket, has visited Reading and that‚Äôs saying a lot. I know a lot of people in my city aren‚Äôt well informed about politics but they certainly notice when candidates visit more often than others and so far Trump is winning that battle. He visited Reading in 2020 and recently J.D Vance visited Berks County, now trump is visiting on Wednesday.

A group of us is looking to drive out from nyc to Pennsylvania on Monday and Tuesday of the election to canvass and participate in the GOTV effort. I‚Äôm looking to connect with someone to find out what areas of the state or Philly are highest need for volunteers. Is the campaign organizing anything like this? Or should I still continue to reach out to the PA Dem party (I have done so a few times over the last few weeks)?

Content: Thank you! Yes exactly we are looking to join a canvassing team in Pennsylvania on Monday and Tuesday of the election, but I didn‚Äôt see any events for those dates yet. I wanted to see if we need to wait for those to be published, or if we can sign up for a training separately and then create our own event with the group we bring for those dates. We don‚Äôt know what cities in Pennsylvania or neighborhood in Philly are highest need for the campaign so wanted to connect with the campaign for next steps. I did the volunteer welcome training online this afternoon and they directed me here for info!

Content: I called and spoke to someone at the Berks Democrats. It wasn‚Äôt the guy in charge from the Harris Campaign but it was someone that did work for the Berks Dems, he said that there are some events happening between now and before Election Day, to persuade some voters and that includes appearances by some major people (this would all take place in Reading ofc) but he said that‚Äôs all he could tell me. I was happy with that response but I still plan on calling tomorrow so I can speak with Casey, who‚Äôs part of the Harris Campaign

Content: I see. Even if one or two of you are able to make it in to PA for an earlier canvass, I feel like often that is the best way to really get connected. By going on a ‚Äúscouting mission‚Äù you can meet the organizers in the field office, exchange phone numbers, get the lay of the land, and be able to maximize your organizing. If you‚Äôre unable to do that, another route could be to try to join a phone bank through the campaign in PA and you may similarly be able to connect with someone who can help you with planning. Personally, I‚Äôm down in Louisiana, but just sharing from my prior experience.

Content: If anyone has contact information for a field office in Pennsylvania, that would be great! The online volunteer training I did with the Harris campaign said this would be the best way to connect with them to organize volunteering. Thanks so much, all!

Content: Asha i too would advocate a scouting mission by a subset of the group.   Also some portion of the group familiar-with && excited about canvassing if possible; so you all can hit the ground running and self-support to a degree.   I am no expert.  Those last days I believe are typically about getting folks‚Äô votes in overcoming challenges/excuses/apathy.  Giving rides for some or knowing which drop off locations for a given county can be drive-up for mobility impaired instead of climbing-stairs/standing.

Content: Asha Here‚Äôs a virtual event for out of state future volunteers https://www.mobilize.us/2024pavictory/event/708250/ 

And if signed up for an in person event in campaign office  you get a contact info of local coordinator and might start conversation that way.

I do not know eastern PA folks. 

Also if parts of your group can phone bank from home ahead of the trip that may help refine their campaign conversation.

Thank you so much, that‚Äôs exactly what we needed!

He's worried because he's seeing the numbers are too close in the Keystone State so here's what I want you all to do: look at your calendars and sign up for a phone banking shift. They run from 9 AM to 9 PM seven days a week. As PA goes, so goes the country! https://www.mobilize.us/2024pavictory/event/718933/

Content: The former guy is doing a "townhall" in Oaks on Monday. Plus the rally in Reading last week. It really seems like Kamala needs to be hitting the collar counties around Philly hard, not just the city itself. Just my opinion from here in MontCo. Anyone share this concern?

Content: Looking for info. I'm downstate NY, can get more specific in a dm. When I look up carpooling all I see are options to form one, nothing to join one. And all the bus trips I've seen seem to be on Saturdays which doesn't work, or aren't leaving from a  location near me.  Any suggestions? Also what's the closest point in Pa  to downstate NY where volunteers are needed most, in case  I look at whether I can just get there on my own. thanks

Content: Hey Mary I went to Newtown Pa which is in Bucks county and just across from Trenton NJ. I basically signed up with the PA democrats and found that as closest to me (although it did take me 2 hours or so to get there). I think the above are all the buses that do go - not sure if there are other open routes

Content: Hi! I live in Houston, Texas, but I want to help make calls to Pennsylvania voters after I take the Dials from Dawn 'til Dusk dialer training tomorrow evening. I know that we will be given a script in the dialer and that I will be able to answer questions about Harris-Walz, but shouldn't I also be prepared to answer questions about Bob Casey's campaign for US Senate? If so, are there some suggested talking points for Casey and his challenger Dave McCormick that I can review before I make calls in the next few days after training? Thank you!

Content: I was doing canvassing training today in PA with a busload of people coming in from NY. We had A TON of food to give to people, but I think that was a fluke. It was from a group that wasn't comfortable canvassing or phone banking so they donated sandwiches and snacks. You could always email the person on the contact form on the confirmation email.

I would also just ask as you have here in both PA and NY rooms to see if there are smaller groups driving down that haven't formally made it an event. https://events.democrats.org/?q=carpool    https://events.democrats.org/?q=bus

We could use some help posting campaign-related news to those. We find all of the posts for you -- you don't have to do any work besides posting a few articles here and there (depends on when there's a rally or other event).

Content: I'm going to look into this more. I've seen this question a lot (online and in person) and I would love to help coordinate things. I'll let you know if I find anything concrete. I will say, I know a few groups that need drivers for a few people bussing in from NYC to canvass in Montgomery County AND that we could be driving people for early voting already.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

(Additionally, there really ought to be an 'Independents for Harris' field ü´† - chose 'Republicans')

Content: Well <@1291523703137632302> we all find the things that work for each us.  Thanks for making efforts.   General population phone/text banking might be great for you or canvassing.   And within that maybe certain types work best for you (GOTV for known supporters‚Ä¶ or what not).   Keep it up, when we fight ‚Ä¶.

I read further and see the feeling sick points you make‚Ä¶ the reach app has tons of materials and I found it can be useful to read those to help refine my understanding of campaign messaging on a broader set of topics.   I also used it to find folks that were (potentially) not registered that I knew‚Ä¶. Thus not hard sells on influencing their vote.  In the few detailed conversations phonebanking being able to search the reach app sure helped me speak better to specific concerns.

IOW Can use the sick time to prepare to succeed.  And try out tools/group-zoom-training  to hit the ground running when voice recovers.

Content: <@1288296844346261621> Thank you ever so much for the very detailed response üíô üïäÔ∏è  -- is there a Democrat-centered tutorial for Reach I can peruse ? Or just in general ?  Need to understand it better.   I have been ill all day -- it is almost certainly a transfer from someone staying at my sister's house last week (current loc)  I will have to see how I feel in the morning. 

The texting training session seemed to flop unfortunately.  I received an email later on the evening asking for an indication on how I felt it went -- but there never was any visible way to join the session in the first place; doubtlessly I have missed a critical step and will need to try again.

I hope to be able to phone bank soon -- at the moment though my poor throat is very upset with the world. ü´†  Is why I was attempting to find the texting session. 

If I could find accommodations in PA
I think that I could do well at canvassing, since I spent several years there, trying to talk to various locals.  But the sickness , which could well be a covid variant (another sister told me that a wave has hit üëÄ ) complicates there.  I must find some testing kits.

Content: I feel sure that given an opportunity to hold a conversation with a Trump supporter for enough time, I would be able to insert some decent amount of doubt. I have a good grasp of many of the relevant issues (esp. inflation and economy; perennial favourites)  

Being an Independent, and also devout, I know how to connect on these cultural issues too. The problem is *time*, which everyone is rapidly running out of...

Content: I debated another extreme Republican (rural PA) four years ago, and gradually forced his conversation into the defense. Am quite proud of that one.  He eventually reverted to the default though, and by last year was supporting Trump again... (many do this for whatever reason. Honestly , though they hate when it's said -- this *is* a cult and must be treated as such)

Content: Hey folks! Thank you for joining us. **Together, we will write the next chapter in the greatest story ever told.**

Phonebanking is our **number one priority** so close to the election, and it‚Äôs a phenomenal way to get started. We often set goals for specific numbers, like how we set a goal for 5 million calls this past weekend. We made 4.6 million, reaching immense numbers of people!

We‚Äôre 300,000 calls behind our goal for the day, and we urgently need to call Wisconsin voters. Early voting starts today in Wisconsin, and people need voting plans! We‚Äôre only **14 days away** from the election!

[Can we count on you to help us? Please, click here to get started and call directly into Wisconsin!](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=32641249-daa7-4253-b97b-df11f362bdb3&ref=go_kh_calls_wi&utm_source=hfp_w_go_calls_20241022&utm_campaign=hfp_w_go_mb_do_vol_vrec_calls_20241022&utm_medium=go_kh_calls_20241022&utm_term=go_kh_calls_20241022)

We know it‚Äôs scary for many of you. I have the same anxiety as well. But a second trump administration is much scarier. We can do this!

Content: That‚Äôs great <@511551672829476864>   The PA laws on electionineering(campaigning) shocked me when I first experienced them being pushed.

Electioneering is allowed 10 feet from the polling place.  The polling place‚Äôs outer boundary; rarely is that the door to the building facing outside from what I have seen but could be.   But usually there is a second door in places like a government center.  So that leads to really close activities.

The electioneering activities can‚Äôt be seen or heard from within the voting area of the polling place as well.   And folks can‚Äôt obstruct passage in/out of building.

But state election laws wise it‚Äôs pretty permissive compared to the norms I‚Äôd accumulated from other areas.

Still useful to contact and discuss with local Dem or elections teams whenever you see something suspect though.     

A tent on sidewalk that is needed/intended for public walkway probably is an issue if not permitted/accepted ‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôd not be an election-specific issue unless it hindered passage to polling place.

Content: Since this is PA channel.  And I do handle this stuff.  Yes iwillvote is a great short hand resource. 

But for what it‚Äôs worth‚Ä¶. VBM voters if voting at polling place on Election Day should bring as much of the ballot materials as they can with them to polling place.  If they didn‚Äôt receive them still go.  There is a bit of paperwork but it‚Äôs less signatures&forms and a non-provisional ballot if you bring in all VBM materials to surrender.

Content: FWIW That direct flight on Alaska airlines from seatac is nice for this travel.  


I do not have great pointers to folks organizing for that specifically and hope you find some, folks asking similar questions for other parts of PA in weeks past have gotten things in order; you can search earlier messages on this channel.   But be sure to check mobilize and consider rideshare2vote.   Within mobilize the 2024pavictory group and Hadley ( https://www.mobilize.us/hadleyhaas2024/ ) are good ones to check.  There have been events in-advance for out of state volunteers held online‚Ä¶ have been helpful for folks.  

The 6024 broad st Pittsburgh, pa office is very active and I believe would take all helping hands.

As well there are county senior citizen housing towers around the region which I‚Äôve dropped food off to share in the past and suspect those locations would be great places to pick folks up and take to the polls.  For food at least the message gets out fast through informal grape vine by talking to a few folks in lobby.

I‚Äôd strongly recommend doing phonebanking or texting in advance of travel to an area so you‚Äôre refining your voice and hearing more from a given state.

Good luck, hope those ideas help in the mean time‚Ä¶ and that you get more-specific info from someone else.

Content: Hello <@&1245910841832902766> ! I'm SO excited about the incredible grassroots organizing happening in this state channel. ü§©  Our other campaign priority - which, yes, includes communicating with all kinds of voters about how awful this Trump/Vance stuff - is phone banking. To Matt's point, if we take the White House AND the senate, we can think about things like adding Puerto Rico as a state. But in order to do that, we've gotta work hard to get Kamala and senators like Bob Casey elected. If any of y'all have some free time today or can make a commitment to calling in this last, final, critical week, please come join us in <#1242256751445934262> or hit up the dialer [right here](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=9ccd3f9e-fa00-4de0-8919-eef3896d1a0d&ref=natl_dis_host_discordveveryoneelse) . We are in awe of all the work you are doing already, but we can only do this thing with more of your help!  As Coach has said, it's time to leave it all on the field.

Content: Hey, if anyone's looking for another way to help out, there's a Congressional race in PA's 1st district that could use your help. Ashley Ehasz is running as a Democrat in PA-01 against the incumbent Brian Fitzpatrick. Now I live in PA-01 and I can tell you that Fitzpatrick is a bit arrogant and claims to be an independent Republican but he really does side with MAGA on a lot of stuff. Anyway, the campagin has phone banks that are on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday. There's also phone banks all day on Election Day. I've been facilitating the Saturday ones and also I'll be facilitating them on Election Day. We use Scale to Win just like the Harris campaign and training is ALWAYS provided. Please sign up...she was so close to winning in 2022 and I feel we could get her elected in '24! https://www.mobilize.us/ehaszforcongress/event/709910/

We still need all the help we can get in our final weekend (and during the week), so feel free to send me a DM if you are considering helping or have questions
