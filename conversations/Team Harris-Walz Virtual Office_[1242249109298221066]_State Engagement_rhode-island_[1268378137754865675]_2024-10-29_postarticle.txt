Content: I have lots of family and friends who are very excited about Harris for President. But, I know they wouldn’t want to canvass or phone bank. So I thought I could have a postcard writing party. But I can’t find any information on how to get addresses for voters in the swing states or even if there are Harris Walz postcards available.  Who should I contact for this info?

Content: The DNC should be paying for materials and distributing them. I’d be happy to fill out cards, but I cannot afford the postage. This is what donations go to. Isn’t there a training on this?

Content: Carolyn, there are no events of any kind listed in RI. Maybe the Harris campaign doesn’t have a presence here yet?  I checked the Progressive Turnout Project as people in the general chat suggested, but their search for people to write postcards is complete. I’m assuming it’s just early and that RI will start mobilizing soon… hopefully.

Content: Sandrine, I scrolled through the momsrising Facebook page and they shared lots of posts about the Democratic ticket and convention. They also support many of the policies of the democrats. I think it’s ok to participate in their postcard program to get out the vote. But I also want to send postcards to swing states for Kamala Harris. I’ll check out turnoutpac.org. Thanks!

Content: I know that in the past and currently there have been letter writing campaigns in/out of South and Newport County. I’ve been meaning to try to reach out to folks I know who’d been involved with organizing those efforts. ADHD has not been my friend there. But I do intend to do so and then I can let you know. If I don’t, feel free to poke me!

Content: Same issues here. I'm so disappointed in RI. I even wrote a letter to RI's  Democratic Committee. I'm calling Reed, Whitehouse, and Magaziner tomorrow to complain. We need a fun rally that we can have ourselves.

Content: Absolutely Joanne! Maybe if another of us call, they'll do something. They pulled Tim Walz into Newport by invitation only for donors. How about constituents? I have a Dr's. Appt. Thurs. in the same building that the Election Division is in. I'm going to stop in and talk to them too.

Content: I haven’t received a reply from the RI Democratic Party either (maybe they are busy with the primary on Tuesday?). I did see Magaziner’s phone bank listed on mobilize, as well as the debate watch party being held by the LGBTQ caucus. I have 100 GOTV postcards coming this week and another 100 at the end of September. So, I’ll be able to gather family and friends together to write some postcards.

Content: I talked to Magaziner's office too. I heard there's a national women's march on Nov. 2nd. Hopefully, RI will be part of it. I'm doing so many videos on social media and calls. I'm working at the polls, but I'm watching the debate with family and friends immediately after.

Content: On this day 4 years ago, a record 3.3 million Americans cast their ballot early.  And as expected, only 1.7 million early votes have been cast (a 45% decrease).  Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!
