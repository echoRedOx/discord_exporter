Content: Hi - I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, CA. I've done phone banking once and happy to help in whatever way I can.    I am wondering if somebody can direct me to the right contact.  I have a lot of IT/Software Engineering background.   I run a small company and am very skilled at Data Analytics/ and general process automation.   I'm not looking for a fulltime job but happy to volunteer to help streamline operations, data management/analytics and help with anything data/software related, where I can probably help create more impact..   Most of the listings in the main Kamala Harris website seem to be fulltime roles,  which don't work for me.   I'm looking for part-time, volunteer type projects to help with...

Content: Hi <@1280765333002518591> sounds like you have some valuable experience. The volunteer activities here are all about connecting with voters in phonebanks, text banks, hosting parties, etc. The phonebanks have data captains who are part of each session, if you are interested in that role you can ask in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1242256751445934262 . More advanced data analytics would be a full time job at campaign HQ https://kamalaharris.com/work-with-us/
