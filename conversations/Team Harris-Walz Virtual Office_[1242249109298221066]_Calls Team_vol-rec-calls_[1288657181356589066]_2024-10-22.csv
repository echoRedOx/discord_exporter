Welcome to our new channel for making friendly phone calls! We'll use this space to coordinate getting lists for:

** Volunteer Recruitment Calls **- asking supporters to volunteer for Kamala 
** Confirm Calls** - making sure that people who are signed up for events & volunteering shifts have all the information they need 
** Rally Invite Calls** - inviting people to see Kamala or Tim (or other special guests) at campaign events 

We will have volunteer calls open all day starting tomorrow, though there may be times where most of our volunteers are calling voters in battleground states, and therefore these calls will run slower. 

In the meantime, we'd love for folks to get familiar with our dialer tool! You can sign up for a phonebank training here: https://events.democrats.org/event/664004/

And then check out some of our resources here: 
* **How to Use the Dialer:** https://go.kamalaharris.com/resources/dialer/
* **Phonebank Volunteer FAQ: **https://go.kamalaharris.com/resources/pbvolunteerfaq/
* **Dialer Training Video: **https://go.kamalaharris.com/resources/dialervideo/

Thank you for being on this team!"

The issue is that this is such an important election, NV is an important state, and there are multiple organizations making calls.  The person can ask to be removed from the list, but that is just OUR list.  Others will still call.  I have had some success explaining all of this to people, and those that support Kamala Harris generally will be nice, at least.  All we can do is stay positive, polite, and sympathetic.  (on a side note...I now answer almost every call I receive, even the ones marked 'spam', because it might be a volunteer looking for that positive reinforcement to keep making calls. üòç )"

Usually campaigns get updates on who has already voted and remove those people from their call lists.
