Thank you so much for fighting so hard against misinformation. Autumn provided some awesome resources. 

Don't be dismayed if no resources or data will sway many folks. Sometimes our effectiveness is best served by knowing who is open and who is not and focusing on those who are open to discussing issues and partial to facts and not conspiracy theories. And remember self-care! 

Spending time with fence-sitters who are trying to make a decisions, rather those who already have made a decision, is the most effective way to find more votes for Kamala. 

Thanks for the good, hard work you're doing!"

I have sparred with this neighbor before and heâ€™s drunk the Koolaid. No reasoning. I want to be accurately informed about this, for my own benefit as well as being prepared to respond down the road.  <@936622618293968958> thanks for the excellent links. I was just about to try to find an answer to the question of states such as CA, not requiring voter identification. How will they prevent fraud?"
