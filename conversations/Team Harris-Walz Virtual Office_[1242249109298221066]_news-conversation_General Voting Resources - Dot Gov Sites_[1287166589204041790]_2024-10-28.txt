Content: I am not finding anything to support the print your own ballot issue. Also, we have to be careful about sources we post, speaking as a mod, X is not one.

Content: I removed the X thread, because anything regarding voting issues or details, we have to be careful of sources. Verified news, dot gov sites and a few orgs although those we have to vet closely.

Content: Thanks, I got side tracked a bit. Here's an example of an allowed source as it is a state run site. https://www.mo.gov/government/elections-and-voting.  You can do the same for MT or any other state.

Content: My opinion at this point is that we cannot verify the source on X, and I have not found any news sites that report problems of this type in MO or anywhere else, so I am dubious.  Therefore, just share the official sources and treat the rest as noise.  Of course, if there is an issue, we have legal groups and voter protection groups to address whatever really exists.

Content: Here's an example of an allowable site, as an official site of the US Govt  Share America dot gov.  It talks about ballots in other languages, but at no point does it say those can be printed by the voter. Of course, that would be a great risk. https://share.america.gov/ballot-in-your-own-language/

Content: Yes, that too. I found Share America more universal though for general news, because language inclusivity is important. One of the many things we do not want to lose in our democracy.

Content: That is FVAP dot gov - official US govt site (so it is permitted - mod side note). They help anyone vote who is living overseas, including dual citizens, even those who have never resided in the US but still retain their citizenship. The never resided in the US only applies to some states apparently, Regardless, we need every vote.  https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter
