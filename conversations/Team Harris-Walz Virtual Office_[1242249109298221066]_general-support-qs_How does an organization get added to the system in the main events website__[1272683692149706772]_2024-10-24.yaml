  content: <@1272583070087643180> The approval process using Mobilize's template for
    [Community Events](https://events.democrats.org/c/host-a-relational-event/event/create/)
    would be faster, because the DNC would need to manually verify events submitted
    using Google Forms (data-entry into Mobilize).

  content: You're welcome!  The Google Form is intended for events that don't fit
    the Mobilize templates, but its approval process is slow.
