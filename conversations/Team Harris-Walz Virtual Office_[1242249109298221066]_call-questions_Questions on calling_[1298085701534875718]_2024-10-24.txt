Content: On many calls I get the same recorded voice asking me to push any button to continue. Is that an answering machine or should I push a button somewhere?
If a person has already voted, how do I code that?
If someone answers and says the person I'm asking for is not home,what do I code that?

Content: For the first it is either google voice or an answering machine so just end call and choose "answering machine" in the survey.  If they already voted and the script doesn't have that option(some do) select strong Harris (or whatever appropriate), how they plan to vote and skip to the end or end survey early after you've answered those calls.  For the last question the survey response is call back.
