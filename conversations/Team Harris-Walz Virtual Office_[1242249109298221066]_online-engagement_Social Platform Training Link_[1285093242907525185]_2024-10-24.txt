Content: <@1268161496441946215> - Found it. This social platform training is focused on creating your own unofficial groups, so that allows you more latitude in what you share within reason. Of course, all is still bound by community agreements and the spirit of the campaign, but you can share unofficial stuff from affinity groups more freely for example. https://events.democrats.org/event/683653/
