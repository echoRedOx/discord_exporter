  content: "Hi everyone! Welcome to our new channel for making friendly phone calls!\
    \ We'll use this space to coordinate getting lists for:\n\n** Volunteer Recruitment\
    \ Calls **- asking supporters to volunteer for Kamala \n** Confirm Calls** - making\
    \ sure that people who are signed up for events & volunteering shifts have all\
    \ the information they need \n** Rally Invite Calls** - inviting people to see\
    \ Kamala or Tim (or other special guests) at campaign events \n\nWe will have\
    \ volunteer calls open all day starting tomorrow, though there may be times where\
    \ most of our volunteers are calling voters in battleground states, and therefore\
    \ these calls will run slower. \n\nIn the meantime, we'd love for folks to get\
    \ familiar with our dialer tool! You can sign up for a phonebank training here:\
    \ https://events.democrats.org/event/664004/\n\nAnd then check out some of our\
    \ resources here: \n* **How to Use the Dialer:** https://go.kamalaharris.com/resources/dialer/\n\
    * **Phonebank Volunteer FAQ: **https://go.kamalaharris.com/resources/pbvolunteerfaq/\n\
    * **Dialer Training Video: **https://go.kamalaharris.com/resources/dialervideo/\n\
    \nThank you for being on this team!"

  content: "Matt, I understand the frustration.  The issue is that this is such an\
    \ important election, NV is an important state, and there are multiple organizations\
    \ making calls.  The person can ask to be removed from the list, but that is just\
    \ OUR list.  Others will still call.  I have had some success explaining all of\
    \ this to people, and those that support Kamala Harris generally will be nice,\
    \ at least.  All we can do is stay positive, polite, and sympathetic.  (on a side\
    \ note...I now answer almost every call I receive, even the ones marked 'spam',\
    \ because it might be a volunteer looking for that positive reinforcement to keep\
    \ making calls. \U0001F60D )"

    updates on who has already voted and remove those people from their call lists.
