  content: Very interested to see how to go about this. I live in SC and only recently
    became aware of how many Democrats we have. I think many may be like me and just
    assumed we were outnumbered. I voted Republican for 5 decades almost exclusively.
    But after Trump, I will never vote for another Republican or anyone I know of
    Republican elected officials who have enabled him. I would love to find more voters
    like me and encourage them not only to vote for Harris -Walz, but to volunteer
    if they would like to. I  know I'm not the only one. Recently, some of us new
    and old Dems met up for breakfast at a local restaurant, wearing Harris tees,
    etc. Unheard of previously!! Thank you for this tip.

  content: <@1267752019188514826>  for sure! I also finally got in touch with the
    person who is curating/ maintaining this list. So if your networks have other
    opportunities that aren't present here, I can connect them to get those events
    listed as well. The only ask is that ppl ensure the event isn't already here (which
    seems incredibly reasonable)
