Content: On this day 4 years ago, a record 3.3 million Americans cast their ballot early.  And as expected, only 1.7 million early votes have been cast (a 45% decrease).  Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: <@&1245910301916921929> Early voting has started in many of the swing states, so this weekend is CRITICAL to our GOTV efforts. It's also incredibly important that we make sure that people with mail in ballots have gotten their ballots and understand how to return them. This is such important work, and we have to close strong. But we can't make our 10 million call goal without your help. If you're experienced, you can go straight to our dialer [here ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=933f666e-c699-46e3-ac92-12d9cf6f3992) - if you're new, please join us over in <#1242256751445934262> to get connected to some training! (If you don't have that, go to  <id:customize>  and choose "talk to voters in key states.") Even making a few calls helps. Many hands make light work. Will you please come over and join us?
