Content: Hi...I did all of my training/shadowing for chat captain, data captain, and facilitator.  I went ahead and signed up for my first few shifts. I thought that there was another discord channel that I was supposed to see now.  Is there still something I need to do to get that? Or am I just too excited and should just chill out and wait for it? ðŸ™‚
