  content: "Hello \u2014 I, along with a few friends, are interested in canvassing\
    \ or helping out in some way in a swing state.  We are willing to manage our own\
    \ transportation and housing.  We previously volunteered doing canvassing for\
    \ the Obama campaign in swing states.  My memory is that we coordinated doing\
    \ this via a coordinated campaign office and/or direct campaign office. I live\
    \ in CA so decided to focus on AZ.  Called both AZ party and Maricopa County party\
    \ and did a sign up but not heard anything back.  Same with Gallego office.  It\
    \ is very difficult to find a contact person to ask these questions to.  It is\
    \ also difficult to find a phone number or key contact person for a coordinated\
    \ campaign office.  Are there enough local volunteers in AZ that perhaps they\
    \ don\u2019t need or think it best not to use out of state volunteers??  I also\n\
    did a DNC or Harris virtual call on ways Californians could help in swing states\
    \ where they gave us a link to indicate what state we might like to help in. \
    \ I\u2019ve not heard anything back.  Anyone on here in the know on how or who\
    \ is managing out of state volunteer help in swing states?  Thank you."
