Content: **IT IS PRIMARY DAY!**

**All ballots are due by 8 PM tonight!** 

If you know of ANYONE having issues with their ballot, get them to one of these resources ASAP:

- Local library
- County elections center
- sos.wa.gov - WA Secretary of State website
- votewa.gov - WA Secretary of State voting database
- wa-democrats.org - WA State Democrats (our state level party)

Again, **all ballots are due by 8 PM**. Anything not postmarked or in a drop box by then will not be counted. So let's get out the vote and make sure Democrats are elected up and down the ballot!

Content: Hello to my fellow WA folks! I'm Adrienne (or Addie - I use both equally) from Seattle. I'm looking to drum up some motivation in my swing state friends (mostly PA, GA, and FL). I also want to use some social media messaging to encourage my traditionally red friends in ID to vote blue this time around - quite a few of them depend on IVF to build their families, so I'm focusing on that.

Content: WA is the place where the state Republican party actually, officially made a MOA or something about being explicitly anti-democracy. It was in Spokane, in the Spring, IIRC.
I want to see Harris and Walz come here and speak the truth about why democracy is normal and is the healthy way to handle our differences.
I think Walz can knock that one out of the park.

If you buy them directly from here, then you can make sure your money is going to the campaign instead of elsewhere! These signs are also American-made and union printed 🇺🇸

Content: Hi! I'm Suzi from Seattle. Glad to see other WA folks here! I'm hoping to help out with content creation. (Yes, my applicaiton is pending). But the online engagement trainings also gave me ideas on how I could leverage engagement even though my networks are already almost entirely Harris supporters.

Content: I can't put up a sign in my complex, either. We have size restrictions to signs and the one's to purchase are too large. But there are a lot of signs outside my complex and there are no Harris Walz signs.

Content: For transit to this event: Sound Transit Buses from Seattle to Bellevue Transit Center.  Or park at the Redmond Technology Station and take the light rail to Downtown Bellevue and walk. Or the King County metro bus 271 from the U-district. Or if you're coming by car, drive to a light rail stop that has a parking lot and then take the light rail into downtown Bellevue. It is very difficult to park a car in downtown Bellevue. There are buses from Issaquah to Bellevue.

Content: Does anyone know if  there is any organization l can connect with about volunteering in a swing state?  l am planning a trip to Michigan in October and l would love to spend a few days knocking on doors in the St Joe/Benton Harbor area.  l canvased door to door for Kim Schrier in the 8th in 2018 and l think it was the most effective thing l have ever done.  We flipped that seat and l know l got some people to vote for her.  Anyone know who l could ask about this?

Content: Driving a car into downtown Bellevue is difficult because of the traffic and the lack of parking. From Redmond, take the light rail to Downtown Bellevue Station or take the B bus directly to downtown Bellevue Station. I think the 250 might stop over there too.

Content: Hello, I'm really anxious to do something irl, rather than online. 
Was thinking about, in the past, I've seen people holding signs on a bridge over I-5 during commute hours. 236th has sidewalk on the North side for AM and 220th is on the South side for PM. Don't get me started on why there isn't sidewalk on both sides. Wouldn't be built like that today, thanks to Biden. Anyway, if people are interested I would like to do that. Maybe in October when ballots go out? 
I'm open to everyone else's ideas too.

I'm interested in local efforts, but focusing on swing states. 
The post card idea is interesting. Old-school, but back in the day mailers & door hangers were considered vital tools.
I've done calling & texting. Both have flaws but if done right can work.
There was a "vote-trading" app back in 2016 called #NeverTrump. Very cool idea.
Then there's various social media platforms...
What is the best bang for the buck?
UPDATE: I found this site for postcards: https://postcardstovoters.org/

Content: According to many organizers I've worked with, the greatest bang for your buck is talking face to face with people you know. Followed by, in order, 2) talking face to face with others (e.g. door knocking) 3) postcards 4) phonebanking.

Content: <@823637152595836939> this site might be the place to recruit volunteers to postcard for an event you organize and then you can either get a list from one of the other websites you mentioned or reach out to your local dems to see if they have local races and lists they would like you to use.

Content: Reason being Kelso's district is home to Rep Jim Walsh, the current Republican state party chairperson. He's also kind of a butthole as a person imo. So wouldn't it be funny if he lost an election?

Content: How did it go? I’m in AZ this week and was going to watch the gov debate online, but our president debate watch group here had a lot to talk about and I didn’t get to it - I’ll find a replay of it when I get home. I went to a Ferguson fundraiser a few days ago and am trying to do my part there.

Content: 👋 I'm in Seattle.   Are all calls only virtual? In past cycles phone banks were also in person at campaign offices. Heck... Obama even had a field office for phone banking in Salt Lake City in 2008.   Or is everything 100% virtual now?

Content: Congress woman @pramilajayapal made this video in Detroit, MI yesterday where she is canvassing! DJT said in a rally this past weekend that he will take away citizenship and the right to #VOTE from naturalized citizens. This is important in so many critical ways to many of us here who have spent our best years in the US building and serving the communities around us! Share widely https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBHJX7BSbbD/

<@1126738859493949504> IS THERE ANY VIDEO CLIPPINGS OF TRUMP SAYING THIS THAT THE CAMPAIGN TEAM CAN SHARE? Would be powerful to pair this with her statement

Content: Hi <@820178098280595488> - Thank you for your work. I will make sure to share that within Online Engagement too.  Regarding your flyer posted two days ago for the Oct 16 event, we had to remove it since it was directly related to fundraising. I sent you a DM, which I will also include here since it impacts all events.

Content: The email I sent to everyone on my contact list:

To those people I know, whom I have known for a long time and whose children grew up with my children: when you tell me that you're voting for Trump/Vance, ... are you really telling me, knowing who I am and what I stand for, that you are going to vote for these men because they will make the trains run on time?
 
If so, we're done. 
 
I do regret losing some people with whom I have a long history, but I cannot, in good conscience, maintain even a cordial pretense of civility with people who support white supremacy and the destruction of our representative republic and the repudiation of our Constitution and the rule of law.
 
Most respectfully,

Content: Thank you both for sharing your views. It's clear that these kinds of decisions—whether to continue relationships across political divides or set firm boundaries—are deeply personal. Quenyar, you're expressing a sense of ethical duty, while Steven, you're emphasizing the importance of engagement. I think both perspectives have merit, and it’s helpful for us as a community to respect that different people have different limits on what they can handle emotionally and ethically.

Let’s try to focus on where we can find common ground in how we engage with others, whether it's setting respectful boundaries or choosing to have difficult conversations, but still ensuring we treat each other with respect here in the server.

Content: Remember that many Republicans across the country are likely plotting similar stuff, but being a lot less vocal about it.

Content: Where is the “NO” campaign for some of these ballot initiatives? I see “YES” signs all over, and they are clearly lies! 99% of people living in our state won’t “pay less” if I2109 is passed. Public schools will suffer… 

“To protect critical funding for schools, early learning, and child care, the Olympia City Council passed a resolution yesterday opposing Initiative 2109, a state ballot measure that would repeal Washington State's capital gains tax.  

Enacted in 2021, the capital gains tax applies a 7% rate on the sale or exchange of certain long-term assets, such as stocks and bonds, for individuals with annual capital gains over $250,000.”

Content: I’ve seen a few No signs but the yes signs are definitely more plentiful. I don’t know why there aren’t more no signs. I keep telling everyone I know to vote no! I’ve texted friends and posted on social media.

Content: It's an effective pitch to affluent Washingtonians (which includes many Democrats!) to lower their taxes and to Republican Washingtonians to "cut taxes for any reason [even if the shortfall ends up negatively affecting you]". Hopefully it gets rejected but I think that's why there's not much visual "No" support.

Content: I think it’s misleading. How many people do you know selling capital gains over $250k? Anyone able to do that should be willing to give a portion to public schools. It’s literally making money on money for doing NOTHING. Any democrat voting “yes” on that is not a democrat…

Content: Fair. I never thought of a home sale, but I don’t think the initiative includes it. From what I’ve read, it was about 400 people that paid this tax last year. So I’m thinking it doesn’t.

Content: My 2 cents: although I firmly oppose I2117, _both_ the YES and NO campaigns are engaged in some super sketchy financial and ethical stuff. It feels like the GMO labeling initiative from a decade ago (the one where both sides got fined a ton).

Content: Also, this is the first year major initiatives have ran during a major election in several years. They usually get ran during odd numbered years for better voter targeting. Having 4 initiatives show up next to a make-or-break Presidential run overwhelms people and usually causes even less voting for the initiatives period (even considering odd numbered years have lower voter turnout overall).

Content: Myself, I make zero decisions on advertising. I actually read the Voters' Pamphlets. I decide on my candidates based not just on what they write, but how they communicate. And regarding initiatives: it does depend on who backs these issues, and what "skin is in the game." I read the arguments for and against. If there's financial tables included, I will try to understand them.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: <@&1245910985492008980> Early voting has started in many of the swing states, so this weekend is CRITICAL to our GOTV efforts. It's also incredibly important that we make sure that people with mail in ballots have gotten their ballots and understand how to return them. This is such important work, and we have to close strong. But we can't make our 10 million call goal without your help. If you're experienced, you can go straight to our dialer [here ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=933f666e-c699-46e3-ac92-12d9cf6f3992) - if you're new, please join us over in <#1242256751445934262> to get connected to some training! (If you don't have that, go to  <id:customize>  and choose "talk to voters in key states.") Even making a few calls helps. Many hands make light work. Will you please come over and join us?

Content: Does everyone know to tell voters who may have been affected by the vandalized (burned) ballot drop boxes that they can go to the Washington State Voter's Portal, check their ballot status, and download, complete, and submit their ballot (per instructions) - thereby cancelling their paper ballot and replacing it with the electronically submitted ballot?
