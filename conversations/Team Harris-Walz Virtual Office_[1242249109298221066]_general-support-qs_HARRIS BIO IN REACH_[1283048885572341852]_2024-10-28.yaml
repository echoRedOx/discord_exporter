  content: "My online strategy going forward - I want to reintroduce the VP with her\
    \ background.  The print type and then the video.  I want to encourage folk online\
    \ to volunteer with REACH graphics and \u201Cin the field\u201D photos.  I\u2019\
    ll be out canvassing.  I can mix that with campaign graphics and video.  This\
    \ should take me to October 1st.  Use the same strategy for Gov Walz.  NC starts\
    \ early voting around Oct 17 and \u201CSouls to the Polls\u201D is Oct. 20th when\
    \ we shift into high gear.  I love REACH content because it\u2019s \u201Cprofessional.\u201D\
    \  I have a Facebook buddy that has a graphic that I can \u201Csnatch.\u201D \
    \ Just wanted to see if the campaign had anything better\u2026. Looking forward\
    \ to obtaining stuff from tonight\u2019s debate!  I\u2019m \u201Call in!\u201D\
    \  Will be canvassing and \u201Cbanking!\u201D  Thanks for your help!"
