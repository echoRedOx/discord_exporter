Content: I didn't want to lose him either. I think Daddy Andy could take McConnell's seat if he wanted. Might be the place he can do the most good for decades to come.

Content: Hi everyone, I was curious if there are any comprehensive master-docs hyperlinked with reputable  sources/stats outlining failures and flawed logic of Trump/republican policies? Particularly economically? Many Americans in socioeconomic groups that republican policy historically harms are convinced Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúeconomic superiority‚Äù justifies everything else. 

I‚Äôm hoping to find a database of resources similar to this document created by an activist in 2020, but haven‚Äôt found anything similar that‚Äôs more relevant to the 2024 election: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/e/2PACX-1vQu3FFQnKObUTmABEnw-s1TKYH9-9tpKXQoQYHAS-QjNiGcTE3vow42a99FXNi_ZoC0Q6gM9LfxasCe/pub?pli=1

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Content: I wanna say it was $25; my local party did help the homeowner get a replacement put up, but they‚Äôd also accept any donations to make up for that cost! But don‚Äôt feel like you have to at all! If anything I‚Äôd ask you to make the donation directly to Jeffery Humble, my district‚Äôs Democratic candidate for the KY House! üíô
