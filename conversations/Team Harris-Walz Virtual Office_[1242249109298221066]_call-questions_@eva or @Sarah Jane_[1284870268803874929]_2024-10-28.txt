Content: This is Amy Berk. I saw a blank for today for a co-facilitator, 9/15, 4-6p. I completed my shadow shift yesterday. I will sign up for the shift so I can get the link. Will someone let  me in when I arrive early?

Content: I cannot find where to sign in for the shift. Can someone send me the Zoom link? This is my first time co-facilitating. Thanks.  I'll also look in the facilitator channel. (I am new to Discord, too!)

Content: Amy, the link for the shift is at the top of the spreadsheet.  Change your name to facilitator and use the facilitator background.  Log in 20 minutes early.  At 15 minutes early, the host will log on and admit you.  Move yourself to the VOTE team room (sometimes called the debrief room or preparation room…not practice room).

Content: Changed my name to Facilitator. Where do I find the facilitator background? Found the link for the shift in the red type at the upper left of the spreadsheet. I will be there at 20 minutes to the hour (4 ET/3CT). Very excited! Thanks!

Content: Success! uploaded and reads properly - but I'm kind of backwards, which is disorienting. I will just hide my image from view. LOL

Content: I thought the screen mirroring is what made it read right. I'm loath to play with it - since it looks fine to me. And I don't want to see my image while I'm facilitating anyway. Thanks as always!

Content: Thanks, Tom! I am excited and looking forward to it. I'm reviewing the training slide deck. It says the updated deck for the day/session will be sent by email. I'll be fine without the newest deck, since the training deck doesn't change. But would love to see it if available, Thanks

Content: sorry to jump in, I'm reading things here as I prepare to also jump into being a MOD soon. I also have mirroring on so because it's disconcerting to have it off. So my background looks backwards to me but forward to everyone else who sees me not mirrored! I just checked with the other Captains to make sure the first time I used it.
