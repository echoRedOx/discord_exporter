Content: I clicked the option showing my pronouns, clicked every emoji representing my pronouns, and moused over the rest of that sceen in "Personalize-your-profile', but nothing seems to happen.  I can't tell if my pronouns have been set (or what else to do to set them), and I don't see a way to move to the next profile personalization questions.

Content: Thanks!  But how do I move past that step to make my "other personalizations"

Content: You can continue to personalize your profile by clicking on the "user settings "gear next to your name in the lower-left, then click Profile, then you can choose either "user profile" or "server profile" and change your name and your picture.
