Content: I was getting dozens of solicitations from campaigns and PACs across the country and texted back STOP to many of them. I think I may have accidentally done so for the Harris campaign, because I haven't been getting any texts for a couple of weeks now. I tried texting JOIN to 30330, but I'm not sure if that will fix the problem. Can anyone check on this for me?

Content: Hi <@1268674602931064902> I appreciate your wanting to never miss a text from the campaign. If you texted 30330 that signed you up again and you should be receiving texts going forward. Let me know in a few days if you are still waiting to receive texts.

Content: You might also try going to the 30330 text message thread on your phone and texting JOIN or START to see if that helps. I think JOIN got me back in when I opted out at some point.
