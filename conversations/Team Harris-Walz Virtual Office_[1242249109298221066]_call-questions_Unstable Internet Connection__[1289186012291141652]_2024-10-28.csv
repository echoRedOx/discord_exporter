I used to have no problems, but have now been forced to move the router in my home so my PC occasionally disconnects from WiFi. I don't think I can do any more phonebanking using my computer's audio, but it is possible to still use my phone for audio while my PC is connected to the dialer? Or will a drop in WiFi still cause my calls to disconnect? I'm so sorry about all this."

I'll try another phonebank soon and see how it goes. It stinks because I like phonebanking and feel like I'm doing something good, but now I'm worried I'd do more harm than good if I disconnect in the middle of calls."
