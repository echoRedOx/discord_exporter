Content: If I add survey information about people I’ve connected with in Reach after I search/find them by name and zip code, should I disclose to them that I’m doing so (in case they will be contacted by the DNC in the future based on the information I provide)? Also, if I upload my contacts to Reach to try and find more people I know to connect with, what does the campaign do with that information? I asked these questions in the Q&A during the Reach training tonight but my phone died before my questions were answered.

Content: Yes, I recommend that you do tell them that you are collecting their info, but the DNC will protect their info. Since I have not yet attended a Reach training for in person contact or relational organizing, I recommend that you email your questions to reach@dnc.org for a more detailed answer.
