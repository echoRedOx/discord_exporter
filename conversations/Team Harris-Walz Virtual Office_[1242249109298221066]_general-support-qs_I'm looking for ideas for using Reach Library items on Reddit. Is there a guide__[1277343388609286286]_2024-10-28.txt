Content: r/politics forum isn't media friendly but has a large audience so I need more text type suggestions. In another forum that takes media, I have to save to my photos library from Reach, then export file to move to Reddit - more work than I would like.  

Suggestions, anyone? Am I even asking in the right place?

Content: Hi <@1276944228483600492> when you tap on your user icon (top-right) on the Reach screen, the menu has options for support. I suggest getting in a live chat with someone there.
