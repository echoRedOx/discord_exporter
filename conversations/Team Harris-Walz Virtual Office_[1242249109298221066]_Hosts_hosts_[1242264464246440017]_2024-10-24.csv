1 ½ oz St. George[1] Botanivore gin
¾ oz crème de violette or liqueur de violette
½ oz Ferrand dry Curaçao
1 oz Meyer lemon[2] juice, freshly squeezed (about the juice of 1 lemon)
(optional: a splash of elderflower liqueur)

Shake with ice. Strain into a chilled coupe.

Garnish with a thin slice of lotus root tossed in baker’s sugar. (The sugar keeps the lotus root from oxidation.)

[1] St. George Spirits is an artisanal distillery in Alameda county, California (the county where Kamala Harris was born & raised).

[2] Meyer lemons (which grow better than many other citrus trees in the fog-prone San Francisco Bay Area) tend to be sweeter and less acidic than regular lemons. If using a regular lemon, consider reducing the amount of juice."

I subscribe to Native news online because I am half Native American. The disrespect shown the Native community by Tim Sheehy in Montana hasn't even been addressed by the Harris/Walz campaign. And that senate seat is crucial to keeping the democratic senate. Harris and Walz need to (even briefly) appear on that reservation and the campaign needs to see that the Native vote is not being taken for granted or we'll lose the senate and be hamstrung by republicans. Again. How do I get the attention of someone who can get this message to the Campaign managers?

Alternatively (bc printing gets expensive!) I've seen groups print only a few color flyers, which they put in reusable holders and swap out if/when needed.

Thank you so much for being a host! Swag kits are sent out of the host signs up early enough to receive the kit before the event. Since the debate was tonight there wouldn’t have been enough time and the sign up link info was probably changed. Our next host event will be for Kamala’s birthday later this month! I don’t know if there will be swag kits, but sign up early and you should get one if so. (You get an email after signing up to host and that has info on how to sign up for swag)"

Thank you so much for hosting an event! If you'd like to do postcards at your event, you will need to connect with an outside source as the campaign does not do them. Would you consider hosting your phone bank instead of postcards? Phone banking is the single most impactful thing you can do outside of a battleground state! We have lots of help and training available for phone bank hosts, too! Here's some more info:

I'm hosting a phne bank and I have a caller that was in touch with a woman in Nebraska who hasn't yet received her mail in ballot. She was voting for Kamala and getting nervous. The caller got her name and number. Anything we can do to help her out? She's elderly.

Your caller should always direct voters to iwillvote.com and send them the voter support hotline number. We don't have a mechanism for calling people back individually
