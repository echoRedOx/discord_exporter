  content: "Hi <@1279476516945662074>  we don't have any permissions to affect anyone's\
    \ Discord accounts. \nIt sounds like this person has already tried recovering\
    \ lost passwords. The only real option I can think of to recommend is to have\
    \ them create a new Discord account with a different email address. Once that\
    \ is done, they can rejoin the Virtual Office and then would have to reach out\
    \ to the staffers for whichever teams they're on to get permissions for those\
    \ teams with this new account."
