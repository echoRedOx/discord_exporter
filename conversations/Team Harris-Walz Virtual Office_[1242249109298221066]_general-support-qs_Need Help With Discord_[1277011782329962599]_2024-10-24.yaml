  content: My wife has been through the texting training and has completed the forms
    and is ready to start texting but is having problems getting on the Team Harris-Walz
    channel. When she signs into Discord it looks like an old account. Can someone
    help us with this? Her name is "Melissa Black [Colorado]". Thanks.

  content: 'Hi Michael! As promised, tagging <@568257600228032512> here for when she''s
    on later. In the meantime, I''ve been casually told by another off-duty mod who
    is more fluent in discord the following, could try it:


    That usually happens when multiple people share 1 computer to log into things,
    OR if the user has tried to log into discord from more than 1 device and accidentally
    created 2 accounts'

  content: But when she logs out of that account and tries to log in to her new account
    it says the password is wrong. However - she is using the same email so if she
    says "Forgot Password" or whatever and she goes through all that to change it
    and then logs in again it just takes her to original account. I mean - she is
    IN Discord just not where she was the other night and with a different user name
    and an old profile photo.

  content: Discord in the browser. She completed the training earlier this week -
    did the little reports/exams/whatever - and received the DM on Discord the other
    night but then could not use the message field to respond. I forget what it said
    exactly but it had something to do with registering I think? Her username was
    consistent with Scale to Win and everything looked good to go but she couldn't
    respond to her DM for some reason. And then today she logged into Discord and
    went back to what appeared to be an old account with an old profile photo and
    old channels. Can she be looked up somehow? "Melissa Black [Colorado]".

  content: So that is because it's an announcements only channel but she should have
    access now to what she needs. We highly recommend she go to <#1268398483841220649>
    and <#1268398608097476750> which really help orient to our server and workflow,
    now that she's in.
