  content: "Thanks, this is a great resource. I am still confused though -- the document\
    \ states that \"**[Harris's] proposal builds on the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019\
    s work** to reduce barriers to homeownership based on medical debt and limited\
    \ credit history. The Administration sought to recognize renters who regularly\
    \ pay their rent on time, by incorporating a borrower\u2019s positive rental payment\
    \ history into the analysis **for first-time homebuyers to qualify for Federal\
    \ Housing Administration (FHA) loans that are underwritten by the federal government**.\
    \ \"\n\nSo when we're saying that the Harris proposal builds on the previous work,\
    \ we're saying that the new proposal is now involving a grant and not a loan like\
    \ the previous work? Or is this saying that the proposal is expanding the Biden-Harris\
    \ loan program to broaden the criteria for getting these loans or increasing the\
    \ amount?"

  content: Hi <@231995843731914752> - All good questions that I'm not sure we are
    equipped to answer. We only have the document itself. The intent and interpretation
    is not something we are comfortable weighing in on.

  content: 'I see there is a reference to the Detroit Down Payment Assistance Program,
    which according to their website (Ref: <https://detroitmi.gov/departments/housing-and-revitalization-department/homebuyers/detroit-down-payment-assistance-program/how-does-it-work>),
    is in fact a grant not a loan, so this would lead me to believe it is probably
    a grant* program being proposed.


    Just something to be mindful of the difference. In my conservative/Republican
    circles there is opposition to this policy because they are concerned that giving
    away assistance in the form of grants will push home prices up. Although, the
    most common objection I hear is that "it would raise the cost of all homes by
    $25k", but I don''t believe this is even close to accurate because the impact
    on the market depends on how many buyers qualify for the highest level of assistance
    or qualify at all, depending on the details. Convincing my conservative friends
    on this issue is probably going to be a tall order, but from my perspective, even
    if it does impact home prices to some degree, it is worth it for us as a society
    if the end result is a higher rate of home ownership'

  content: As a CA resident, I have to agree. It's also interesting that pushing up
    home prices is a bad thing here but when talking about crime or immigration, the
    rhetoric is that it will lower home prices. Good talking points for people in
    phone banks and out canvassing or in OE. Have you been seeing this come up in
    voter engagement on any of those teams?

  content: that's fair. I will say that our Republicans who phone bank tend to gain
    a lot of traction when we're calling swing states because they can speak to why
    they support Harris and ppl are more inclined to listen
