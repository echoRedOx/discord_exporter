Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!
