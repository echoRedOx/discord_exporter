Content: I thought I remembered seeing a post asking for people to help out on Discord. I can't seem to find it now. Could someone reach out to let me know what kind of help you need and what the time commitment is?

I have experience organizing volunteers, phone banking and text banking. After making the switch from Slack over to Discord I feel like I can navigate it well now.

Content: H Laura, I really appreciate you reaching out and sharing more about your background and engagement. As the server gets bigger and bigger we will be brining more moderators onto the team. One of the best ways to "apply" is to share helpful suggestions that are supportive of new volunteers in the https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1242249109298221069 and other channels.
