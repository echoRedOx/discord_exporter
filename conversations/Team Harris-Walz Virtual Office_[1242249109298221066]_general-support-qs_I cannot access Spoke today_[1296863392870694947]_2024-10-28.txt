Content: I cannot access Spoke/Scale to Win from my ipad. I’ve tried Chrome & Safari.
I use a Norton VPN. I did not change any settings etc. I’ve been texting from Costa Rica for years without trouble.
This issue started yesterday. 
I’ve been texting regularly and suddenly all the text campaign links lead to a  screen that’s blank except for the text: Message: Forbidden”
Anyone suddenly encountering this issue? Any ideas to fix or get around it?
