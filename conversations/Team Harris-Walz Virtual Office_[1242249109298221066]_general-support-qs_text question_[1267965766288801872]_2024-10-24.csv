Currently the text training events are the only time text campaigns are running so you're not missing anything yet. Staff is still working toward getting regular text campaigns up and running.

I attended the text training on 8/7 but haven’t been added to channels. I suspect it’s because my screen name was not my full name until yesterday when I realized the issue. Is it possible to get added?

My wife and I both attended, filled out the forms, joined the discord, and texted that night. However, since the initial night - she has continued to receive requests to text and been included in onboarding, but mine has fallen off with no requests or access to the proper Discord channels. 

From reading through the posts, it seems like this is an issue for others and I understand the delay - but wanted to put my name out there as well to help if needed and to please add me to the channels so I can assist. Thank you for all you do!"

A few days of waiting,  I ended up signing onto newsom’s pac to text.   Recognize a lot of names from FL and National 2020 over there.   Yesterday a mod posted here that text team was full through Nov - should I check back here?  Tons of campaigns over there, but I’m not sure if texting Arkansas for vol candidates is most effective"
