  content: Hi Sonja- Thanks for checking in. Some of the campaigns are replies only,
    FYI. If you are having difficulties with STW, please post in general-support-qs.
    Watch the texting campaigns channel for links and try to get into one as soon
    as it's posted. Thanks for being here!

  content: They started with some campaigns that are now reply only on September 16
    also. Maybe that's what happened? They just posted replies in texting campaigns.
    What happens if you click on one of those?
