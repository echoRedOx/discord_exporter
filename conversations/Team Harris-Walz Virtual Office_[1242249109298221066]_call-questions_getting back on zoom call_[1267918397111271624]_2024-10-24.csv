Can someone let me into the call?"

Iâ€™ve tried to park in Atlanta and itâ€™s a mess, I didnâ€™t want to tell people there was or wasnâ€™t parking available so I asked on here.
No one answered until 3 minutes before the phone bank ended (while I was trying to get on the zoom) so I didnâ€™t make any more calls.

I canâ€™t remember what the script said exactly, but a lot of it was very wordy so I trimmed some down because I could tell people didnâ€™t want to be on the phone too long.
Additionally, the dialer was kind of slow, typically took 30 seconds to a minute to connect to a call."

As to the script, it often can be super clunky so you did the right thing in cutting it down, which you are 100% welcome to do! And yeah, the dialer is a lot slower when there's not a ton of people making calls."
