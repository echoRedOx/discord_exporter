  content: "I went through all of my emails. None were signed up. I tried logging\
    \ in with my # and hit forgot password - my boyfriend created an account in his\
    \ name with my only number I\u2019ve had for years. I tried getting a free number\
    \ through text now, but that also won\u2019t work because is a voip. I deleted\
    \ the boyfriend\u2019s account, and I\u2019ve included the screenshot of that.\
    \ It was suggested that I ask here and possibly get a family member\u2019s number\
    \ in the meantime. Any idea when that will actually delete? I have been loving\
    \ text banking and I do not want to lose my account! Is there another account\
    \ if this isn\u2019t the one that\u2019s blocking me from verification?"

  content: Hi <@734999912013496321> it takes 2 weeks for a Discord account to delete.
    You can use a family member's phone number on your account for two weeks and then
    change it to your own phone after the other account is deleted.
