Content: I just use "Queen" when it comes to Kamala. Either that or boss lady...because she is the ultimate boss lady. God, I have to stop watching RuPaul's Drag Race.

Content: I think we WANT to use her name though, don't we? It gets her up in the algorithm? or are platforms supressing posts with her name

Content: I have a question and maybe someone can answer this for me. Some people tell me that the coconut emoji can be considered slightly racist since some say it's you're one race on the outside but another on the inside. Does anyone know about this? I never heard of this but I also don't use a lot of emojis because I just never did.

Content: Someone- who is French and not on social media a lot said that to me but when I explained the CONTEXT (remember- we all exist in the context , etc) and where it originated- from her speech- they totally understood. I suggest using the coconut and the palm tree together to avoid confusion...

Content: Thanks for the clarification, everyone. I'm mixed race just like Kamala (in my case it's I'm white and Native American) so I also try not to be disrespectful of other's cultures so I was wondering about this but you all helped me greatly understand it.
