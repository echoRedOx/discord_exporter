There's an option on there to register to vote, and it says ""This will take 2 minutes."" But after putting in your info,  they give you the option to either print and fill out your own form or have them mail you a completed form to then mail in to actually register.

THERE IS NO ONLINE VOTER REGISTRATION IN TEXAS

It is best to direct people to https://www.votetexas.gov/ where the site actually explains the voter registration process. Much less likely to result in folks thinking they've registered to vote online."

In general, the campaign is encouraging us to practice active listening, and really trying to connect with the person you're talking to on a personal level. Ask them questions, and like Chris says in the comment I linked to, leave them breadcrumbs to follow and reach their own conclusions. Sometimes just gently showing support for a point of view your neighbors may not have considered can move the needle a bit and sometimes it's not necessarily the person you're talking to who's being convinced, but someone else in the room who's listening.

I will also add, that our energy is best focused on reaching folks more likely to support and making sure they are registered to vote and that they show up! It's entirely possible for us to make big strides in Texas simply by increasing turnout. Get those who don't usually vote to do so and we can really turn the tide in Texas!"

I read Chris’s comments and in many ways they reminded me of when I was interviewed by Newsweek for an article on the Chinese telco giant, Huawei. I found responding to negative report based questions with a simple “Why not?” and then turning to facts that, for instance, showed in a Kinsey Report actually commissioned by Newsweek that American companies led by CEOs with military service outperformed others. Opening the door to thought with some very edible breadcrumbs. The problem was Newsweek’s mind was already made up. The article had already been written. The interview was merely to cite a conversation with me as a C-level member of Wireless Marketing. You are right. With minds closed or resistant to any discussion, maybe the best thing to do is simply encourage voter turnout. I’ll keep trying!"

...it would be a good way to court Anti-Trump republicans. This convention is not all about celebrating everyone who speaks. It's about winning folks to the cause.

I loathe Trump and republicans. I thought Walz was a perfect VP pick and wanted Biden to step down so Trump would lose. However the idea of the DNC giving Republicans multiple slots to speak and not a single Palestinian-American then to top it all off have someone like Bush speak would be too much for me. I still think Kamala will win because democrats have finally stopped trying the “when we go low, we go high” nonsense and have rightly called republicans weirdos. Also Trump is incapable of shifting his campaign strategy to adapt to Kamala and seems to miss Biden which is funny."

I'm in Dallas county and I'm planning to get reciprocal certification for VDR in Collin county! (I need to call and make that appointment today--thank you for the reminder 😊) 
For ways to get involved locally, I hear good things about:

• Collin County Democrats (You might consider [becoming a precinct chair or working with your precinct chair](https://www.collindemocrats.org/what-is-it-like-to-be-a-precinct-chair-democrats-collin-county/) to turn out voters in your neighborhood)
• Richardson Area Democrats
• Powered by People is doing some great work, too. (As I can attest from personal experience!)

You also might consider reaching out to the campaigns for local candidates as I'm sure they could point you in the right direction! I hear that the race for Ted Cruz's senate seat is actually within the realm of possibility this election 👀 so that might be a good one to collaborate with. I think we all remember Cruz running off for a little vacation while the rest of us froze in our homes 🥶 Sure would feel good to give him the boot! 😉"

It owns the Tampa Bay Times and operates the International Fact-Checking Network and PolitiFact. Their methodology for fact-checking is detailed here: https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/.

The Institute maintains web pages for political figures and social media outlets, which track PolitiFact fact-checks. These checks typically begin with statements that gain media attention or appear in online postings. I accessed candidate pages (here is Joe's https://www.politifact.com/personalities/joe-biden/) and lists of mainstream social media pages, then recorded the fact-check results in a spreadsheet, then graphed it.

This specific graph exclusively represents data from presidential candidates, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, Donald Trump, and J.D. Vance, so the party affiliations are factual and not based on opinion. The media data is aggregated from various sources with combined fact-check scoring from platforms and figures such as X Posts, Facebook Posts, Instagram, Viral Images, Bloggers, TikTok, Threads, PunditFact, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Rachel Maddow. Each source has its respective PolitiFact page, ensuring the scoring is accurate as of last weekend. All this data has been categorized under the umbrella term ""Media"" and is neither scored as Democrat or Republican."

We just spent the last 3 days figuring out independent in-person/virtual phonebanks, (thus playing catch up lol) so I have plenty of resources & best practices for anyone who wants to set up their own pb or jump in with us - we're in locations across the state and will be joining the Harris campaign, doing weekly calls on Mondays. (Which means we're not necessarily calling Texans.)

As for Colin Allred & other TX-wide campaigns, I'm still in the process of getting connected and hope to find out what they need - but there are really great GOTV campaigns like Beto's PXP and I'm often working out of the NE Bexar Co Dems office, so if anyone wants *info that can't be shared on this Discord per campaign finance laws* ..... 👀 ..... shoot me a PM and we can talk offline.

(US Senate) Voting for Colin Allred could be a HUGE win for holding the US Senate! Plus send a huge sign to Ted Cruz, who officially has the most vulnerable seat in the GOP. 
* Events/Volunteer Opportunities: https://www.mobilize.us/texasoffense/

(US House) Michelle Vallejo is our ONLY US House candidate (for TX-15) this district stretches narrowly from Seguin down through Floresville, Alice, to McAllen. This is a SIGNIFICANT race for Republicans hoping to keep the House majority.
* 😭  I need to find a contact in her campaign, there is a donate button on every page so we can't link to ""michellefortx15"" at all

(TX Supreme Court) There are also 3 TX Supreme Court candidates who could have huge impacts on things like abortion; lgbtq+ rights, protections; etc.: 
- DaSean Jones
- Christine Weems
- Bonnie Lee Goldstein

(Progressive GOTV) Beto's Powered By People campaign is going full-speed until the 10/7 voter registration deadline! If you're local, check out their TONS of volunteer opportunities getting likely Dems registered/motivated:
- https://www.mobilize.us/poweredxpeople/

As for other races - there's a really cool (org) website *I can't link to* called Common Cause where you can find a personalized list of your districts to get involved with your local candidates! 😉"

I subscribe to Native news online because I am half Native American. The disrespect shown the Native community by Tim Sheehy in Montana hasn't even been addressed by the Harris/Walz campaign. And that senate seat is crucial to keeping the democratic senate. Harris and Walz need to (even briefly) appear on that reservation and the campaign needs to see that the Native vote is not being taken for granted or we'll lose the senate and be hamstrung by republicans. Again. How do I get the attention of someone who can get this message to the Campaign managers?

I volunteered to organize the Women’s March here in Dallas on November 2nd and it got approved by Women’s March Inc on Monday. They are marching on D.C. same day and time.  

I’m working on the permit to host it in Dallas. City Hall Plaza and the Ronald Kirk Bridge are booked. My team is checking with Klyde Warren Park. 

I could use some help. Please DM me if: 
1) you know of locations that could be suitable in the city for a special event / March like this? 

2) you are able to help or have connections to others that might be able to help. 

I’ve added the event page, do sign up and share with friends. Once the location is solid we will start pushing media content for voting and marching!

""Ahead of its May convention, the Texas GOP had just five employees — compared to 50 at the same point in 2020, the last presidential cycle. Last month, the party reported that its 2024 convention ran roughly $600,000 over budget and resulted in a staggering, $382,000 loss. From mid-May until early September, the Texas GOP’s most important fundraising position was vacant. And in its last financial disclosure, from June, the Texas GOP reported having $2.3 million on-hand — $1 million less than at the same time in 2020.""

""[Texas GOP Chair Abraham George] spent last weekend in South Texas, which he and other Republicans see as critical because of a handful of competitive races. There, former Republican U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores is running a well-funded campaign against Democrat Rep. Vicente Gonzalez — one of a few races that could decide control of the U.S. House. And in state Senate District 27, Adam Hinojosa is challenging Democratic Sen. Morgan LaMantia in a rematch of a 2022 race that was decided by roughly 700 votes.""

[Travis County GOP Chair Matt Mackowiak, who ran against George for party chair this year and organized last week’s open letter by county Republican leaders, said:] “The state party appears completely unprepared for this immensely consequential election and we all need the Texas GOP to raise its performance,” he said. “Immediately.”"

*🎻 SA mariachis playing us all in - they played el rey and rinconcito!! So cool to hear such puro Latinx vibes and the whole crowd singing - at an event with a national delegate!

*Ran into LOTS of volunteers from different local groups!

*Cristela Alonzo - del valle - (first Latina to have her own show on national tv) was ON FIRE!! 🔥  and Gen Z activist Olivia Julianna was so hyped - she's super active online, and only a first-time voter!

*The Castro brothers Joaquin & Julian (with son!) along with Greg Casar spoke about fighting voter suppression and electing those who will fight for access to healthcare!
""We won't stand by while they try to rig the system!""

*(SA) Mayor Ron came out to talk about why local elections are so important... and how Doug Emhoff & VP Harris came out and listened to our needs during the pandemic and made sure our food banks could provide for our communities... while Cruz & Abbot worked for themselves instead.

*Local TX-house candidates Kristian Carranza & Laurel Jordan Swift spoke about providing for our SA neighbors, our students, and the importance of making our voices heard at every level of government!

*And Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff ""let me brag about my wife"" spoke so passionately about his support of his wife Kamala!! He says: Keep the enthusiasm going for the next 43 day - YOU have the power!"

- Registrations rolls are outpacing Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia
- Registration is surpassing population growth, “a sign that more than just new Texans are signing up to vote”
- Texas added almost 2.6 million voters — the size of Connecticut’s entire voting rolls
- Republicans strategists say Texas is “at risk” of following other Southwestern states like Arizona and Nevada
- In 6 years Dems flipped: 12 Texas House seats, 2 Texas Senate seats, and 2 seats in Congress 
- Causing R’s to redraw congressional and legislative districts in the latest redistricting cycle 
- As Harris County gets bluer, statewide margins get tighter
- R’s still have rural West and East Texas, but aren’t adding new voters at the rate of Harris County and the blue spine"

It’s also important to note how conservative DFW and Houston suburbs are. Tarrant county is rather conservative for how urban it is, barely voting for Biden in 2020. DFW’s Collin County was among the most populous counties to vote for Trump in 2020, even though Trump’s margin was only 4 points, almost 30 points lower than Romney’s in 2012. Therefore, there’s a good chance Collin flips blue this year. Montgomery County, which contains suburbs north of Houston, gave Trump 70% of the vote and a margin of almost 120,000, which I believe was his largest in the country (mostly due to the prominence of the oil and gas industry around Houston). However, this was also much lower than Romney’s 80% in 2012. Although the DFW and Houston metro areas have shifted significantly toward Democrats, there is still a lot of work to do.

Although the state Republican party’s increasing extremism should push away moderate voters, there are many Republicans that have moved in from states like California because of it (my parents know some and I’ve overheard some conversations). I have also read that their harmful policies have also pushed some marginalized Texans out of the state, especially trans Texans. Again, I’m not saying it won’t happen, but it’s important to understand the state of things. It can help us focus our efforts and set realistic expectations."

What’s happening in real time is more important than any theoretical numbers. Texas is a very expensive market as it’s pretty much one of the most vast states in the union (I know Alaska’s bigger, but I feel like you could visit fewer places and get Alaska compared to Texas where you’d have to visit a LOT of places.)

I do think if it ever breaks blue and can stay there, it could very well become a Dem stronghold like California and NY currently are, or a consistent swing state."

There are several options to submit a last-minute application by the deadline:

Visit the voter registrar office in your county (find yours here)
Register through a volunteer deputy voter registrar (organizations like local chapters of the League of Women Voters often hold voter registration events)
Mail the application to the voter registrar in your county
If you decide to mail an application, it must be postmarked by the Oct. 7 deadline for you to vote in the Nov. 5 election. You can request the postmark through employees at your local post office. Applications left in mailboxes or mail drop off boxes may not always be postmarked that same day.

You can find an application at county voter registrars’ offices and some post offices, government offices, or high schools. You can also print out the online application and mail it to the voter registrar in your county. This will require an envelope and postage like regular mail. Download your application here.

You are representing so that is the first step. Next steps would be to find out what your peers do care about.  Where do they see themselves next year? What do they want their life to be like when they turn 21- whoever we elect this year will still be president then. WHO do they care about? WHO do they see as worth caring for? They might not care about politics, but to (mis)quote Tim Walz, it sure cares about them.  You can ignore climate change, but it won’t ignore you. You can not care about health care for yourself when you’re young, but what if someone you love gets sick? What kind of air do they want to breathe, clean or polluted? What would they want to happen to their mom if she miscarried and couldn’t get health care? Politics is personal. So listen to their concerns, and explain why voting makes a difference on a personal, day to day level. Politics the word is based on policy - laws and budgets that affect everyone.

Texas Democrats are working to beat Ted Cruz & get downballot Dems elected! You can make a HUGE impact for TX GOTV outreach by joining our statewide virtual phonebanks on Zoom.

Sat: 9am, 12pm, 3pm 
Sun: 12pm, 3pm 

Sign up via links below - all you need is your Zoom login, a laptop or tablet, and your phone. THANK YOU!

The only time I can recall her coming here is to accept a union endorsement in Houston. She’s really busy and has a lot of other places to be, not only for the campaign but also for her duties as VP. I know Doug’s been here a few times and I wouldn’t be that surprised if another major surrogate like Bill Clinton (who had the best performances in the state since the last time a Democratic Presidential Candidate won it (Carter in 1976), losing by less than 5% in each of his 2 elections). He did better than any democratic candidate since then has in the rural south, though I’m not sure how much of that appeal he still holds since Hillary didn’t do too well.

Surrogates are an issue here though since the last democratic officeholders left office in 1999, so most are either very old or dead."

- Texas added nearly 200k voters in the two weeks before the deadline 
- Since 2016, when Donald Trump first won Texas, the state has added 3.5 million voters (equivalent of Wisconsin’s entire voting population!!) 
- Since 2020, state population growth is about 1.6%
- Texas is adding voters at a 10% increase and includes those turning 18, transplants from other states, aggressive registration efforts by partisan and non-partisan groups
- 2020 Biden vs Trump was the closest race in Texas in almost 30 years and the 9th closest in the country
- Fastest voter registration growth by county since 2020: Harris (over 200k) and Bexar (106k)"

Curbside Voting

If a voter is physically unable to enter the polling place, he or she may ask that an election officer bring a ballot to the entrance of the polling place or to a car parked at the curbside. After the voter marks the ballot, they will give it to the election officer, who will put it in the ballot box. Or, at the voter’s request, a companion may hand the voter a ballot and deposit it for him or her.

Remember, you CANNOT use your phone while voting! So to avoid last-minute confusion/forgetfulness (like me 😅), come prepared: https://www.vote411.org/ballot puts out a nonpartisan Voter's Guide where they ask candidates the same questions.

This is what it looks like via mobile - easier via laptop - you can get a personalized list of your ballot races with: office descriptions, campaign finances, what (if) candidates answer, and mark your choices to print / take with you.

(They've made scrolling on your phone easier but... I have 40 races on my ballot. Save yourself & scroll via laptop lol!)

Last thing: Most locations are open 7am-7pm, but hours vary. You can do Early Voting at any location in your county - hours & voting FAQs here: https://www.VoteTexas.gov"

In 2022, the library/courthouse in Melissa was a very fast process and short line for voting. 
Even if there are a bunch of people out for early voting, I can’t imagine a ton of people in Anna or Melissa being out since they’re smaller areas. 

Also, the Frisco Fire Station off of Rolater Rd was also pretty easy in 2020, although a bit busier."
