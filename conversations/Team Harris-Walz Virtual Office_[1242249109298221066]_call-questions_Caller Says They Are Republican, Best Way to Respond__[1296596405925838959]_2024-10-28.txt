Content: Did not say how they were voting, just that they were voting Republican and didn't have time to chat when I asked if they wanted to talk more in depth

Content: ok you can just mark that refused.  They won't get a call back but it won't record as a strong Trump.

Content: if they are just Republicans and are open to engagement/persuasion you can absolutely go down that road.  Its up to you to test if the conversation can be helpful but you can certainly try!
