Content: I had same question about flagging someone for follow up. I got someone yesterday who was leaning Trump who was very unsure and I didn’t feel like I convince him, but I felt like someone else might be able to. We had to end the conversation because he was going to Whole Foods and it just pulled up in his car. But he had his three-year-old daughter in the car and I felt like he’d be open to some persuasion. But I didn’t find any way to have him be followed up with

Content: Hi <@1296461685216772170> - thanks so much for the work you are doing! Unfortunately, we cannot take their personal info down from phonebanks and we cannot call them back or have anyone from the campaign call them back. It's just not allowed. With a week + to go I am sure he will end up getting called again...and maybe mind will be changed? It sounds like it was at least not a hostile conversation.

Content: No it was very friendly and he thanked me at the end so there is that! I tried to be nice and listen and be respectful- and encourage him to vote regardless
