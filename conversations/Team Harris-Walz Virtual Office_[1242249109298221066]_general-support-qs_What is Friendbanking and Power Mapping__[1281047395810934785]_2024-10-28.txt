Content: Generally it's talking to friends online.  Not sure what Power Mapping is.  I signed up for a training session on it.

Content: Hey - I went into the PA mobilize site and thereâ€™s plenty of canvassing opportunities and phone banking too. I in fact did do door knocking last Saturday in Newton PA. Itâ€™s a great way to interact and persuade voters of the choice ahead. Visit the PA site â€”> https://www.mobilize.us/padems/

Content: Oh yes absolutely - very great experience and honestly needed because if youâ€™re not doing it, someone on the other side is and they are taking your lunch! Every vote needs to be chased (and registered if not done so)
