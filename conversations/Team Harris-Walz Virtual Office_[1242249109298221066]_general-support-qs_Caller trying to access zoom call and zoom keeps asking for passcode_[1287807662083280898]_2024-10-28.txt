Content: Caller is trying to join a phone bank.  They did not receive a confirmation email, and when they try to access the zoom link I provided, zoom keeps asking for an access code even though they are logged in to their zoom account, which has worked in the past.  I asked them to log in and out of zoom and that did not help.  What should they do?  How can I help?

Content: Hi <@1277403351667048508> it's possible they are logged into zoom on a corporate account (with more security) try advising them to log out of zoom and stay logged out, then let the invite take care of starting zoom for them. or course there is always the restart the computer suggestion. ðŸ˜†

Content: Thanks!  The caller has been so helpful in troubleshooting.  Other mods say you have to be logged in to your zoom account -- is this something we prefer but is not required?

Content: It really depends on what kind of zoom account the user already has. If it's a personal zoom account then logging in is fine. If it's a work account it could be asking to verify a zoom request from outside of the work  community.
