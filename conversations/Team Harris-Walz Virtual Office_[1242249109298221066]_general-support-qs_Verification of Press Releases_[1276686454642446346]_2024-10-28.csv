Update: I found out belatedly the press release about RFK Jr from the campaign is a real press release. It just seemed odd to mention RFK Jr, although the message to voters is important. My question still stands that it would be great to have a press releases tab on the campaign site or a separate channel here.  Thanks again, Jay E  - PS: I did check and double check the campaign social channel, which I love as it is a great summary.  However, I did not find any post about the press release."

Having a web browser version and summaries within social media help sites like this one would be awesome.  Thanks again for reading this.

Of course not everything is going to be posted, but most relevant stuff will show up in one channel or another"

Yes, I thought of the news channel, but it is not so much discussion, but verification of what is official.  Anyway, thanks for taking the time to reply. Maybe mention it to communication staffers when you have time. Thanks again. ðŸ™‚"
