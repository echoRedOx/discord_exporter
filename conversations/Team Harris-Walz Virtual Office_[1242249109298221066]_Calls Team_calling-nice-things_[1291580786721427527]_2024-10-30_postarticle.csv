A Philadelphian who had to take care of his elderly father and was feeling alone but had found community through canvassing earlier and wanted to vote early and help out on election day.  ETA:  These were not volunteer recruitment calls...  but they turned into recruitment and solidarity too.

‚Ä¶as told by a facilitator

Monday 10-PM to midnight (eastern time)

* Volunteer who out of the chute got a Harris supporter (ie. His first call of the night)

* Woman voting for the first time‚Ä¶for Harris

* Elderly man who said he‚Äôs flying his 89-year-old sister home in time to vote for Harris.

* Several volunteers persuaded people who were considering Trump to reconsider and now they‚Äôre voting for Harris.

* An elderly lady who was for Harris convinced her son who is a registered independent & husband who is a Republican to follow her lead.

* One volunteer presented a a case for Harris like a lawyer‚Ä¶and the caller is now going from wanting to vote for Trump to voting for Harris! 
********
And some bonuses from the PA Dems phone bank I did earlier‚Ä¶

* A guy who was talking to someone who was leaning Trump got him to convert to our side

*A lady got someone to register to vote on the last day of voter registration in PA to vote‚Ä¶and they‚Äôre voting straight Dem!!!!

She sounded relieved that she could comfortably vote for Team Harris.  Felt wonderful on both ends.  I think this is why we do this.

(side note, does anyone know which ad this might be so I can be ready for it on more calls tomorrow?)"

The important thing is that you were able to persuade her AND provide her with the voting information she needed to cast her ballot, and that you both felt great after!

We came up with plan for him to dress in an outfit that feels tough, like armor.  He also was grateful for the info re looking up early voting locations and was going to see if he could go to place less intensely red.  So sad he couldn‚Äôt think of anyone to give him support around it."

Nice guy, pro-democracy/Harris, but when I asked him if he voted, his response was: ""Not yet. My vote really doesn't matter. I live in IL, we're a blue state, we've been a blue state for a long time."" I told him about my phone banking for a couple of nights last wknd & how I was so appreciative of the 90+ yr old men voting for Harris! And, how it's so important that they are supporting women. Not sure I got thru to him how IMPT men standing up for the women in their lives is critical. Not on their radar, tbh. So, I wrote him an encouraging DM to tell him how impt his vote is & that we need him to stand up for us & all the women he loves in his life: his mother, his wife, his sister. He will literally be saving our lives & I thanked him. Hope it got thru to him enough to pass on that message to any apathetic men who don't appreciate how endangered we, as women, are & will be in a TFG admin. Give that final PUSH for them to vote!"
