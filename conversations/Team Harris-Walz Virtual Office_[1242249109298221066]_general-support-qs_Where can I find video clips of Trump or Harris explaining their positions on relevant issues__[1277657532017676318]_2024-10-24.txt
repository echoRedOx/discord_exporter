Content: I was wondering if there was a video archive or playlist of Trump and Kamala videos that show their stance on important issues. For example, if I am speaking with a Trump supporter that is not aware of what Trump has said about the constitution, I could share a video of that. Is there something like that? I think it would be a really helpful resource to help get clarity and facts around important issues.
