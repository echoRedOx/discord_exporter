They seem to be all ending the same way, which is that they see him as a means to an end and believe all of the rhetoric around Harris being a communist and business unfriendly. Some straight, simple content/facts to counter this would be great."

Two nights ago I got a response ""unlike these others, you know exactly what you're doing don't you?""  And last night admins of a local board blocked two comments of mine where I posted quotes and links to FEMAs disinformation page.  These may not seem like much but others are watching and noticing.

Around here, those are victories.

And this morning on an unexpected side of town TWO LARGE sets of HARRIS/ALLRED DISPLAYS."

I do not use X. I am on threads. Is there a way that people can quote Kamala without X?

I‚Äôve had good response by finding out what matters to a person and then letting them know what‚Äôs happening in politics around the matter. One young woman was pregnant and she wasn‚Äôt registered to vote. She said she didn‚Äôt know who to vote for. I asked her what she cared about and she said she didn‚Äôt know. So, I started with well you are a woman. There are some important women‚Äôs issues on the ballot. I told her about the $6,000 for new parents that Kamala has in her economic plan and then mentioned the abortion issue and getting healthcare for pregnant women. She registered to vote while we were talking."
