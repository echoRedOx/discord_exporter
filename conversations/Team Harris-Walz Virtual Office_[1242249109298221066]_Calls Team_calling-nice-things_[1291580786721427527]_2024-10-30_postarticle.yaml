    PA Dems and we had a volunteer tonight who called a guy who is a fierce LGBTQ
    ally and he said he is voting for Harris because he doesn''t want someone in office
    that will take the rights of those he loves away.


    Also, we just got one just a couple seconds ago on the 9PM shift of our campaign''s
    banks where the person answered the call at a wedding and not only thanked the
    volunteer but also said while he can''t phone bank, he''s donating to the campaign!
    This is what I''m talking about, people! This is what we need in this world...we
    need to bring good back!'

    years old and with a walker, and although she''s pretty fed up with politicians
    who don''t keep their promises, and was disgusted by an ad that showed how Kamala
    Harris had paid money for kids to go have gender reassignment surgery, I let her
    know that was a lie and that she should go to kamalaharris.com and click issues
    at the top. We discussed for about 5 minutes what a dangerous, unqualified and
    untrustworthy candidate Donald Trump is, and finally she had made a plan to get
    out and vote. I only felt badly that I couldn''t give her a ride to the polling
    location myself!'

    most people are too polite (or conflict averse!) to cuss you out.  I did have
    one guy tell me I was very misguided but he did so in such a friendly tone it
    took a minute for me to understand what he meant!

  content: 'From recent phone banks: two strong Harris supporters who''d gotten disconnected
    from the movement and were only too happy to learn they could still volunteer:  A
    Nevadan who''d just retired to AZ and was happy to learn he and his wife could
    phonebank for us into NV...  A Philadelphian who had to take care of his elderly
    father and was feeling alone but had found community through canvassing earlier
    and wanted to vote early and help out on election day.  ETA:  These were not volunteer
    recruitment calls...  but they turned into recruitment and solidarity too.'

  content: I just had the most AMAZING call with a voter in PA. I have spoken to undecided
    voters before, but I can't usually convince them all the way during a phone call.
    However, this undecided voter is voting for Kamala Harris, and he also needed
    info about where/when/how which I sent him. This was after a long stream of hang-ups/refused.
    This made my day and I wanted to share!

    and his Wife) who along with their 10 adult children are all voting for Kamala.
    They are also going to knock on doors and volunteer. They were looking for talking
    points and how to make arguments against rhetoric coming from the right. It was
    an awesome call!!

    people where their polling places are - that seems to be the most helpful information

    does not seem to be part of these calls.   Do we not give that type of information
    in these calls?

    on the phone with him for 30 minutes but he hates Trump and is voting EARLY for

  content: I just talked with an undecided voter in Pennsylvania, a young guy who
    had filled out everything on his ballot but president. We talked about what was
    important to him, mostly affordability and housing. He knew about Kamala's $25k
    new home owner plan, and while he didn't think he'd be buying in time but we talked
    and agreed that Kamala probably cares more about his future than trump, who cares
    only about himself, in part because Trump will soon be sentenced for crimes and
    will likely only get away from justice if he wins. Pretty hard to care about the
    country when you're busy worrying about your own legal jeopardy, we agreed. He
    said I could mark him as a lean Harris after that.

  content: I got an undecided tonight too! In AZ. We had a long convo - he was being
    incredibly thoughtful with his ballot. He said he was considering voting independent
    but when I told him that was going to only help Trump, he started to agree more
    and more with why Harris was a better choice. I think I was able to win him over!

  content: First day volunteer. Called a few hours in MI and WI.  No undecideds..
    People who were willing to talk were mostly committed Democrats for Harris with
    a set vote plan. Many were frustrated with the calling volume but several were
    very appreciative of the call and thanked me for my efforts.  That was pretty
    rewarding but the best thing was helping a few people with their voting plans.
    People seemed to like when I offered to look up voting info for them right then
    and there.  That kind of thing kept me clicking the "continue calling" button.

    knocked me out of canvassing for a few days. To see this discord/chat even more
    organized, supportive, inspiring, and thoughtful as 2020 has me feeling some type
    of way about how incredible and sustained this volunteer movement is!! Grateful
    for each of you and all that you do behind the scenes and on the phones!!

    use this specifically to share bright stories from calls.  I'd also move your
    script question to call-questions or calls-team.  Delete both of these after you

  content: Had a call today with someone who was not enthusiastic to vote as they
    "didn't really like much government anything." They were also not thrilled about
    about crime nearby where they lived. I thought at first was going to cause the
    call to go sideways... but I kept listening and she was concerned about Trump.
    I managed to get them straight to harris/walz by the end of the call. Project
    2025 points helped with that a lot. It's my first time phone banking so it was
    great to have a call like this.

  content: I just talked with an older gentleman in Georgia. He said his biggest issues
    were the economy and the border. We had a good discussion and he said he was undecided.
    I think after our conversation, he is leaning towards Harris. This was the first
    call I have ever had that wasn't a hang up, so I was a little shaky, but I think
    we had a productive discussion. I was a little scared to do this before, but I
    feel better now and more ready to make calls until the election.

    as well using the information on the righthand side of the script page so you
    can have many more of these great calls!

    long pause... "You know, that was probably a Trump ad, wasn''t it?"   I told her
    I didn''t know, but it sounded like it was likely cleverly disguised.  Ended the
    convo giving her info on where she and her grandmother could do some early voting.  She
    sounded relieved that she could comfortably vote for Team Harris.  Felt wonderful
    on both ends.  I think this is why we do this.


    (side note, does anyone know which ad this might be so I can be ready for it on
    more calls tomorrow?)'

  content: I don't know which ad this is unfortunately but that's ok---no need or
    expectation for you to be an expert on the ads airing in local markets! The important
    thing is that you were able to persuade her AND provide her with the voting information
    she needed to cast her ballot, and that you both felt great after! This IS why
    we do this, so great job.

    at the end of the night... wasn''t sure if I should go ahead, but I speak it so,
    I did.  Needed information about where to drop off his ballot in person.  Gave
    him all of the information.


    Also asked him if there were any family members of his who needed a push to vote.  He
    said yes.  I asked him to promise me that he would encourage all of them he could.  He
    promised me he would and that he would share all of the information with friends
    and family.  "*Thank you Kelly.... You Spanish better My English!!!*"  Then he
    wished a blessing on my father for encouraging my Spanish, on my family and on
    me for doing the good work since it makes him proud of be an American citizen.  *Gracias,
    Lorenzo!!!*'

    real name is Lisa, btw) & he''s in his late 30s, married, has a 2 yr old son.
    Nice guy, pro-democracy/Harris, but when I asked him if he voted, his response
    was: "Not yet. My vote really doesn''t matter. I live in IL, we''re a blue state,
    we''ve been a blue state for a long time." I told him about my phone banking for
    a couple of nights last wknd & how I was so appreciative of the 90+ yr old men
    voting for Harris! And, how it''s so important that they are supporting women.
    Not sure I got thru to him how IMPT men standing up for the women in their lives
    is critical. Not on their radar, tbh. So, I wrote him an encouraging DM to tell
    him how impt his vote is & that we need him to stand up for us & all the women
    he loves in his life: his mother, his wife, his sister. He will literally be saving
    our lives & I thanked him. Hope it got thru to him enough to pass on that message
    to any apathetic men who don''t appreciate how endangered we, as women, are &
    will be in a TFG admin. Give that final PUSH for them to vote!'
