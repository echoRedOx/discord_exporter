  content: We have a chance on November 5th to make sure either a Democratic candidate
    wins the newly formed Congressional District 6 primary outright or continues into
    the general election in December.   Making sure Kamala gets a majority in Congress
    is vitally important and this is a golden opportunity to add another Democrat
    to the House but I don't see much, if any, mention of the race - at least not
    here in northwest Louisiana.  The district lines are so bizarre, I would imagine
    there are thousands of people who don't even know that they are now in the new
    one.  Does anyone know if there are any events/opportunities to help (Cleo Field's
    campaign in particular)?  <:thankyou:1252806147396735057>

    about using the Reach app... first of all, the campaign has trainings you can
    take - i''m signed up for one tomorrow: https://mobilize.us/s/TVZtNh. and second
    of all, i somehow stumbled across the Reach Knowledge Base online, and went through
    it all and it answered a lot of questions i had. plus there are some great videos
    showing what it looks like and how to use it. it''s not specific to the Harris
    Campaign/Democrats, but it explains the actual app. https://www.reach.vote/knowledge-base/.
    i used this app before in 2019-20 for Elizabeth Warren''s presidential campaign
    but it''s been updated with a lot more features now. it''s a great tool to have!'

    map is so crazy (Shreveport is now divided into two districts) I would wager there
    are thousands across the state who don't even know they're in the new one.  But
    I'm also concerned about the lack of publicity for the Democratic candidates -
    particularly Cleo Fields who the state Democratic party is apparently supporting
    for the seat.  Has anyone in northwest Louisiana seen or heard anything?  It's
    vital Kamala has a Demoratic-majority Congress!

  content: "Hey Paula, I\u2019m in New Orleans but my wife went to tech so love the\
    \ area up there. The Harris-Walz campaign is focused on a swing state strategy\
    \ so most official efforts and investment are geared towards GA, NC, AZ, PA, MI,\
    \ WI, NV. One thing I learned during Gov Edwards\u2019 reelection campaign is\
    \ that so much activity is driven at the grassroots/volunteer level which is why\
    \ the campaign set us up with this platform here. I\u2019ve connected with students\
    \ at Tulane and have been focused on encouraging voter registration via vote.org.\
    \ The great thing about vote.org is that by going to that single site, you can\
    \ get registered in any state. We can encourage students from the swing states\
    \ listed above (along with Florida which has a competitive Senate race) to register\
    \ in their home state. Ultimately, students have the choice to register where\
    \ they are residing for school or in their home state. I think that could be a\
    \ great first step for the college students."

  content: Thanks Nick. There is a voter registration effort at Grambling, and I don't
    think anything is going on at Tech, but trying to find out if it isn't too late
    to help. Right now we are going to work on connecting each other here, doing postcards,
    and encouraging people to do their own organizing through the campaign. I might
    still be able to do a public debate watch party, will know tonight, and then invite
    folks. Thanks for your reply.

  content: <@802573110221864981> - Sorry for the delayed reply. I suggest first starting
    with making signs from the digital downloads section of the Kamala Harris Web
    Store.  https://store.kamalaharris.com/digital-downloads/.  As far as connecting
    with others to display them, that would be via your local Democratic Party offices.
