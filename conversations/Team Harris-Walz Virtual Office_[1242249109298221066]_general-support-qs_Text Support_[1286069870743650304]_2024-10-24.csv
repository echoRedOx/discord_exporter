I'm already a texter in the Gavin Newsome virtual office and Scale to Win (Spoke).  I got a link from a moderator to log in or create an account for Scale To Win for Harris texting.  When I initiate the link and try to log in it says the password may be wrong.  I tried to change the password by asking for a link to be sent to my email address.  It says it sent it, but I'm not receiving it and it isn't in SPAM.  Please help!"

Welcome to the server, and to this lovely group of volunteers.  You should have access to <#1266829704204386334> .  A moderator there should be able to help you further, or you could continue the conversation with the moderator who sent you the original link."

So your best bet is to post your query in <#1266829704204386334> .  Patience is hard some times, but we're worth it, I promise! ðŸ™‚"

And you apparently need to select ""Text Voters in Key States"" in the customize section of <id:customize>  to get access to <#1266829704204386334> .  Sorry about that omission!"
