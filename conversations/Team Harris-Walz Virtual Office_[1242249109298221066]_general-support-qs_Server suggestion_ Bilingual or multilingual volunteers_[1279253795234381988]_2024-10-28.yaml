  content: "Hi, beautiful MODs! Thanks in advance for all you do, what you\u2019ve\
    \ built here is impressive!\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this has been brought up in\
    \ the past or if it\u2019s already in motion, but it occurred to me that it could\
    \ prove useful to add a channel dedicated to Spanish speakers or bilingual volunteers\
    \ in general. Similar to how members are assigned roles according to their State,\
    \ they could also choose to be assigned a language they are fluent in or comfortable\
    \ enough to use when reaching out to voters. Yay for diversity!\n\nAdditionally,\
    \ having select groups with assigned languages can be used as a resource for event\
    \ organizers looking to target a specific demographic, and in turn, make the pool\
    \ of volunteers easily accessible and ready to sign up! Put us in, Coach!\n\n\
    Just putting it out there, in case this speaks to anyone! Have a fantastic weekend!"

  content: Hi <@682653283252437001> I think this is a wonderful idea and I will move
    it forward with staff, I bet we can make space for this in our server channels.

  content: Hi <@682653283252437001> Staff is building a larger program inclusive of
    more languages. It will be a little while but when it's released it will be much
    more impactful than one channel.
