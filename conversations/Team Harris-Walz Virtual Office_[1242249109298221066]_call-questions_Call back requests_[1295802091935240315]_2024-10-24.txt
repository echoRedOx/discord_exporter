Content: I've been making calls to NC voters. Many people have asked me to call back after work hours. Is there a way to indicate the time that someone wants to be called? I've clicked on "call later" but that seemed a bit inadequate.

Content: Hi <@1295799376056418415>! Unfortunately there is no way to guarantee a call back at a specific time.

Content: I usually tell people who ask for a call back at a specific time that I can mark them to be called back, but we can't guarantee a specific time.  Hopefully we will catch them at a better time next time around! ðŸ™‚
