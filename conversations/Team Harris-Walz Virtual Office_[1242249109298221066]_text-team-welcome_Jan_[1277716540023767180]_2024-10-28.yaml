  content: Hi <@1277033337428508722> Thanks! Understood, and apologies it was a bit
    rushed! Did you have a chance to fill out the two forms during or after the training?

  content: No. I was unable to keep up with the training, so I bailed. Still interested
    in doing this work, but the zoom training doesn't work.

  content: Understood - and sorry about that! You can sign up for another training
    (we've taken some of the feedback we heard and have adjusted some things). Plus,
    I know that one training was extra rushed (not normal for our trainings). https://events.democrats.org/event/672393/
