  content: "Yes I also use it at work and it comes in most handy for route, repetitive\
    \ tasks and just generally being an assistant (with a human having the final review\
    \ and approval)\n\nI think there are a lot of uses, even in political campaigns,\
    \ for AI. It\u2019s just that AI imagery in particular is an area I think it would\
    \ be best to stay away from until the impacts of the technology are more clear.\n\
    \nThats not to say no AI at all can be used in the creation process- Photoshop\
    \ and Adobe products have a lot of great tools that use AI to empower the user\
    \ to work more efficiently. But it\u2019s still in the hands of an actual human\
    \ creator, not automatically generated."

  content: 'I know a professional artist who hAtEs AI, and had to uninstall a bunch
    of her adobe toolsets because her sales rep pushed the ai tools on her. I think
    we saw some push back re: ai the other day from someone who suspected an AI gen
    image came from one of our channels. I felt like we were all in the hotbox for
    a good second there.'

  content: "Yeah I saw that, too. Maybe that\u2019s why I am hyper-vigilant when I\
    \ see AI art shared around here, it is an amazing technology which currently occupies\
    \ an ethical grey area (at best). And how the campaign uses AI art will impact\
    \ how people understand the candidates\u2019 stances on AI art and all the issues\
    \ surrounding it.\n\nAt the end of the day, nobody is going to complain if there\
    \ isn\u2019t AI art, but people will be upset if there is."
