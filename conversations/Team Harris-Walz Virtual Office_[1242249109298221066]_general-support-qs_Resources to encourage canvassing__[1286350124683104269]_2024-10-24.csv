I searched the Reach app and found exactly one item for Canvassing, and it wasn't what I consider motivating. Basically, it was more like ""canvassing is something you can do.""

Can we get some resources like have been developed to motivate phone banking, but instead targeted to getting people out to knock on doors? I looked through some of the channels but didn't see anything like that available."

And I acknowledge that our efforts on the Harris-Walz discord server are mostly in  virtual spaces. I will pass this along to creators here and also encourage you to look at your local dems office/clubs who may have effective messaging for canvassing, I found some canvassing events for universities in VA, Training and materials are provide which should include how to promote canvassing to benefit the campaign https://www.mobilize.us/?country=US&q=canvass&state=VA"
