  content: I am currently volunteering for the 4pm phone bank. I have encountered
    several that are saying that they are not a democrat or will never vote for a
    democrat. But these individusals didn't specifically say they are a trump supporter.
    If I follow the script, I am just clicking 'other'? This seems like it is not
    the ideal way to share what happened on the phone call. Please advise.

  content: If all they offer is they won't vote democrat then "Other" is the correct
    choice.
