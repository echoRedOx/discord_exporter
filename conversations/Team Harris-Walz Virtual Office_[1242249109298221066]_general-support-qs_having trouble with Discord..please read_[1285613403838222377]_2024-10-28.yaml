  content: "Having trouble with Discord today.  I put my phone number in yesterday\
    \ prior to cutoff and today it is telling me I have to verify my phone number\
    \ but when I do that it sends me an error message that it\u2019s connected to\
    \ another account.  I followed the steps that were in <#1267941954243526756> in\
    \ Discord.  But when trying to log in with my phone number it says my account\
    \ has been disabled.  So, I tried to create a new account with a different email\
    \ address but now I\u2019m not authorized to do that due to getting a 401 error\
    \ when entering my birthday which is 11-29-1952.   If my account has been disabled\
    \ how can I get it back in use and why would it be disabled?   I have been using\
    \ both my laptop and the Discord App on phone.  What next"
