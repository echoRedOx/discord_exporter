Content: Many, many people on this list have said that they have gotten 3-4+ phone calls from us today already. One even put me on the phone with another volunteer who called someone in the same household as I was. I understand that we are trying to get out the vote to as many people as possible, but this feels a little excessive.

Content: Hi, Will. We are not the only organization calling these folks. You are able to relay that and mention that while we aren't able to prevent multiple calls from different groups, we are grateful for their understanding as we work to support voters.

Content: I have gotten several of those calls today too. I have told the voter that I will mark them as Do Not Call, but that that won't stop other organizations from calling. I tell them the best thing to do is cast their ballot and that will most likely help!
