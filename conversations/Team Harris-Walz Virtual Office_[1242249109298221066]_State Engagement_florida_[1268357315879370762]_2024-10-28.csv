This may seem like the usual talking points but I think more important is turnout.  Hence the efforts here.  And even though registered Republicans outpace Democrats by 1 million, <#1268357315879370762> has a large number independents, which tend to lean blue so we would need them to come through big too.  

In 2022, turnout among registered Republican voters outpaced Democrats in nearly every Florida county.  Higher GOP turnout in reliably blue counties like Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Pinellas helped turn the Florida map red in 2022.  This is also why Desantis' win was so big.

So save yourself and your yard decorations! We don‚Äôt wanna be part of the cleanup mess with our campaign stuff and as much as we love to donate more by buying more, let‚Äôs not be part of the pollution issue.

The main problem is I have to pay my current lease here until November 13 meaning I have nothing to save or contribute to finding another apartment. Once again I have done all of this if I stop paying here I get an eviction notice and once you get an eviction you practically can‚Äôt get into anything else.

Unfortunately we have to remove your post about the gofundme from our channels, because that is considered personal fundraising which is not aligned with campaign finance law. 

I also encourage you to join one of our phonebanks or friendbacks. You will have so much more impact in our of our events were you will inspire folks to get registered to vote so that they do vote for Kamala, instead of attempting to deprogram the trump ppl on the corner. Research shows that talking to non-voters or undecideds is much more successful than talking to trumpers."

The increase in abortions could be even greater if the amendment invalidates laws requiring parental consent before minors undergo abortions and those ensuring only licensed physicians perform abortions. There is also uncertainty about whether the amendment will require the state to subsidize abortions with public funds. Litigation to resolve those and other uncertainties will result in additional costs to the state government and state courts that will negatively impact the state budget. An increase in abortions may negatively affect the growth of state and local revenues over time. Because the fiscal impact of increased abortions on state and local revenues and costs cannot be estimated with precision, the total impact of the proposed amendment is indeterminate."""
