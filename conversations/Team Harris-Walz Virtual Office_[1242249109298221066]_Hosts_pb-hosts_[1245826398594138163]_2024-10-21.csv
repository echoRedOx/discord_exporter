Anyone know where to get Nillia from? I am hosting a huge watch party and I believe I have missed the watch party host kit materials. My County Dem's and State Dem's hq is completely dry. I really wanted to make an impression with such a large crowd but I don't have a single sign.

The only time we are authorized to collect personal information is if we are prompted by the Scale to Win platform to ask for a phone number to send a confirmation text. Even then, we only put that number into the dialer software and send the text. 

**We do not have a vehicle for calling back individual voters**

Collecting voter information creates a dynamic where we may have  promised something we can't deliver and make the campaign look bad, OR  2) taken on a liability for collecting personal information should something bad then happen with that information.

I thought that was a question and that’s what I was answering. You can have your people sign up by sharing your link and then you can export or do anything you want with the contacts however I’m not seeing a spot where you can upload your email list to populate your event. I hope that’s what you were asking. Thanks!

For today's event, the best way to handle this is to create a Zoom event link yourself and send it to the 3 people who are registered. Then, for future events, we can have one of our team members add that zoom link to your events from the back end so it will work for all future events. (You'll want to make the Zoom link a recurring one at this time essentially, so this will work)."
