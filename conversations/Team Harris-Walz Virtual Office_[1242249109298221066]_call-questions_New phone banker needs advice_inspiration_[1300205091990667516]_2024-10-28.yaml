  content: Please share your best advice for a new phone banker.  What do you wish
    you knew when you started?  I feel like others could do this so much better than
    I am doing it. Don't want to stop, but would love tips on scripts/engagement/etc.
    Are there any sample calls to look at anywhere?

  content: Unfortunately we don't have any sample calls. The best advice I can give
    is to make the script your own, don't try to read it verbatim. Ask questions,
    let the voters express themselves, and tell them why you're supporting Harris.  As
    you make more calls, the more comfortable you'll become.

    a way that feels more natural for me.

  content: When you get into the zoom meeting, go to the rehearsal room after the
    training to practice and familiarize yourself with the script. Success looks like
    helping people make a plan to vote, and giving people more information about Harris.
    You don't have to argue with Maga or rude people. Just tell them you have another
    call and say good night!

  content: 'In the end it''s just a conversation, and it doesn''t need to be perfect.
    In fact, it''s probably better if it''s *not* perfect. Our opponents have plenty
    of machines and bots at work for them: we have people, and it''s that human touch
    that really convinces people. Remember, a lot of people are feeling much more...
    *isolated* from actual connection to other citizens because of the current media
    environment. So many things are curated or summarized or depersonalized in one
    way or another.


    On top of all of this, this is a pure numbers game. The more calls we get out,
    the more people we reach, the more likely it is we reach some of the few undecided
    voters out there, or some of the disaffected, exhausted dems out there. Your calls
    are calls that wouldn''t have been made were it not for your effort! So tap into
    your courage and dive in!'
