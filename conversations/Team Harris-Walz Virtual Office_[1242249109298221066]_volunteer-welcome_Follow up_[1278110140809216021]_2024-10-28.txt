Content: Sure! I get that, totally <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>  If you want to help run our Zoom phonebanks, I think that VOTE Team Chat Captain might be a good fit. That job is essentially hyping folks up, posting the links and other information needed to run the phone bank, and answering general questions. Would you like me to grab you the link for that training?

Content: Oh! We have a sub-section of the Online Engagement team that works with the community notes on Twitter to counter the *abundance* of misinformation there. That might be a good fit and is something you can do more on your own time!

Content: If you're more of a creative type, we also have a "Content Brigade." I can tag in someone who knows more about that if it sounds like that might be more your speed.

Content: Of course! You can click as many of those emojis as you want to. Most of us volunteer in multiple areas and you're welcome to participate in whichever areas work best for you.
Since you signed up to connect with your online community, I would encourage you to take the training for that as soon as you can:
Part 1: https://events.democrats.org/event/615101/
Part 2: https://events.democrats.org/event/647793/

We also have a weekly online messaging briefing on Tuesdays, which you can sign up for here: https://events.democrats.org/event/616415/

As always, I and the rest of the mod team are here to help if you need anything! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>
