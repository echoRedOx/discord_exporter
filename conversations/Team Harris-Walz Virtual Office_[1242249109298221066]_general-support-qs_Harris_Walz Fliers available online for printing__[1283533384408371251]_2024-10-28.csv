We are opening an volunteer office in support of Kamala Harris in San Diego.   While our primary goals are phonebanking, postcard righting and caravaning to swing states, local volunteers also would like to print fliers/leafelets to distribute locally to their friends and family.  Are there any fliers/leafelets/etc online, that the Kamala Harris for president campaign has created, that can be downloaded and printed?"
