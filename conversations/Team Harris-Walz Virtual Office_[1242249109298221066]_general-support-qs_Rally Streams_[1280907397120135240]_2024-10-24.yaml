  content: I see there is a campaign event for the Harris speech on Facebook. Is the
    Walz rally in Lancaster and Pittsburg not being streamed? I have a small community
    that loves to watch all the stump events.

  content: I am confused, they don't announce Facebook streams early because of security?
    The Harris one is streamming and was anounced early. Why do they not stream Walz?

  content: Sorry for confusion <@330179392284262411> . Details of live events are
    often last minute. The Facebook crew may not know if, or from where, there will
    be streaming
