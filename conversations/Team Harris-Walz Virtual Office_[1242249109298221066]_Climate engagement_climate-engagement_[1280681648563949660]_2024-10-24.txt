Content: This new channel is great! I posted in the volunteer welcome section “Hi! I’m in New Jersey, and I’ve been volunteering for Democratic campaigns since Dukakis/Bentsen in 1988 because I was concerned about wetlands protection and the hole in the ozone layer. For a long time I voted in all presidential elections but didn’t pay much attention to state/local elections until my county started a cruel and dangerous deer hunt in our county parks. I threw myself into local politics. I now vote in every election and I’m the Democratic municipal vice chair for my town, and co-chair of our state Progressive Caucus. Looking forward to driving over state lines to knock on doors in Pennsylvania!” I’ve worked for Greenpeace, the U.S. EPA, and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. I’m vegan and I now work for Animal Protection League of NJ. Whenever a poll asks what my number one issue is, I say climate change.

Content: Hi, I'm from Massachusetts and have considered myself an environmentalist since high school. I've watched over the years as our Christmases in New England have gradually turned from snow and ice to rain and mud; our Octobers having more days that feel like July; and just last year needing to wear masks outside not due to covid, but to protect from inhaling wildfire smoke from the other side of the continent. Climate change is already impacting my own backyard as well as the rest of the world. Tackling this crisis is my number one priority for this election, one that we know Trump and his oil baron donors plan to do worse than nothing about. I believe there is no other choice for those of us who want a livable planet for ourselves and our loved ones: we must elect Kamala Harris in November to give ourselves a fighting chance for a sustainable future.

Content: Hi, I'm also in Massachusetts, and while I'm not a single-issue voter, environmentalism is near and dear to me. I've done tree-planting jobs and volunteering in New Zealand and Iceland, as well as work on organic farms, and this summer I've been volunteering at the local Audubon Society center. On a more personal level, I've been a vegetarian for about 6 years with veganism on my to-do list, and try to live as car-free as possible by walking, cycling, and using public transportation. I know it's not much, but I hope I can help out here!

Content: Hi I’m Gabby in Delco PA. Picked up my love of the environment from my mom and other family but I also love the environment. I’ve seen a noticeable change in my environment growing up and it makes me depressed, as well as numerous weather news stories (like Katrina. Sandy, wildfires). Also just all the plastic waste around. I work with a a lot of plastic at my job at the PA liquor store and wrote to suggest no plastic. There was supposed to be a ban but it never happened though some of the stores have. Biden has been amazing on the climate and there is no way I can support Trump. So I of course will support Kamala though I am disappointed she changed her view on fracking. Living in PA I understand well why she did so but it doesn’t mean I like it.

Content: My mom and I belong to a CSA farm and watch where we buy meat, eggs; etc. I even bring my own containers on the rare occasion I go out to dinner. I will always ask about where fish comes from and complain if there is styrofoam or plastic (though it seems not to make a difference).

Content: Hi! I spent many years working in renewable energy trade media and extensively covered government policy. I interviewed a ton of governors and other politicians, which furthered my commitment to pushing for solutions to the climate crisis. Huge supporter of the Green New Deal (even got the t-shirt lol) and was a part of an All We Can Save book club/activism circle in 2020/2021. Will happily nerd out about solar module technology, net metering policy, and tax credits in particular at any time. ☀️

Content: Same, I was also there for 2 years and miss it every day. One thing that's stuck with me is that is seems even conservative Kiwis have an appreciation for environmental issues, since the country's natural beauty is so renowned along with the noticable impact of human activity (glacier melt, deforestation, invasive species, etc).

Content: Hi, my name is Pedro Chavez.  My wife and I, are constituents within NY-14th District and are seeking to raise campaign funds and awareness by donating a T-Shirt Design to help  elect  Vice President Harris as President. What is the process to submit our designs and to produce them locally by an affiliated Union Print Shop? 
We have already emailed the official campaign website accordingly.  We have shared the design concept with key people who are ready to place orders and raise funds. 
Would like to set this up, so merchandise and proceeds go to the appropriate channels for distribution and allocation.  it would be amazing to include this design once approved to the official campaign merch online shop.  Please contact us accordingly.  Thank-you.

Content: Hi everyone: I'm a climate enthusiast with many years of writing/editing, project management, policy, and PR experience. Would love to help with drafting texts of any length, messaging, policy research, and/or keeping the team organized. Currently doing a climate-ed fellowship and have integrated many sustainability practices in my daily life. And I live in Germany, where recycling and using cloth bags at the shop are just what you do, bike lanes and trains are everywhere, and even the discount supermarket chains have their own plant-based product lines. I recently joined Zooms for Train Lovers for H/W and YIMBYs for H/W and was excited to learn about all the progress being made across the country. On those calls, many people asked: “how could [X or Y climate/mobility/regulation] work?” A lot of things they asked about, are already taken for granted by people in other countries. Why should the US be left behind? With H/W it won’t be. The IRA, for example, concerned many business leaders over here because it made the US more competitive. Just last night, in fact, I was reading a Reddit discussion about whether the IRA will prompt a large US company to move its EU-based facility back to the US—bringing the related jobs back to American shores.

Content: Hi everyone! Combatting climate change is especially meaningful to me as a hiker, birder, animal enthusiast, and general nature and outdoors lover. I am currently in Massachusetts, where I thought I would at least be safe from the wildfire smoke and heat that I was used to after living in California for 8 years. Not so. This summer, we had at least 3 or 4 full weeks where it was impossible to do any activities outside due to extreme heat or bad air quality from Canadian wildfires. Additionally, worsening hurricane seasons mean more and more heavy surf and beach erosion at my favorite beaches, and fewer resting areas for migrating shorebirds. And of course now, we have a worsening influx of mosquito-bourne viruses in the state including EEE and West Nile---and as someone with preexisting health conditions, I am now still hesitant to spend much time outdoors even as we enter the fall. I look forward to engaging with all of you so we can get Kamala and Tim elected and protect our environment!

Content: Hello! I'm a sixth generation Kansas farmer (claiming the title even if I don't spend much time on a tractor). My dad noted climate change decades before he passed in 2008. Last year was horrid. August monthly average temps were 4.47 degrees above normal. Our crops depleted the soil moisture to eke out a tiny crop. My cousins (guys in their 40s who actually drive the tractors) are probably the last of our family to farm. We have a wealth of wisdom in our family farm operators when it comes to conserving natural resources, but family farms are dying thanks to federal policies that favor corporate farms. We can and must do better.  P.S. My family's farmers are all Dems. I didn't know there was such a thing as a Republican farmer until I first ran for office in 2006.

Content: Feel all this deeply here in CT, Holly! This summer was particularly terrifying with the deadly flooding (and an evening when I got 54 bug bites and have been nervous since about spending time outdoors). Our beloved New England winters have been so abnormally snow-less, too. All hands on deck for electing leaders who will continue to invest in fighting climate change! 💪

Content: Yall, I've been studying and working in climate / sustainability for about 20 years now and the momentum that Biden-Harris have brought to this issue through IRA, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and other efforts are out of the park exciting and what practitioners - and the planet - have been waiting for. Especially given the tough political climate in which they had to act.

I am so excited and hopeful for more federal leadership on incentives for renewable energy, rail, environmental justice, climate adaptation and more. States and municipalities can do ok, but some will and others won't - and they lack the scale that's really needed for these complicated, interconnected, massive challenges.

Content: A big question is what she *can* do in the wake of SCOTUS's overturning of Chevron deference (and various federal regulations) in the past couple of years. It's why we also need a Dem House, so they can pass legislation to fill in major gaps and try to buy back progress that was made but then shut down by one federal court or another. If he wants to preserve the environment, he needs to support candidates who's going to address current issues in the judiciary. I'm not elated with her position on fracking but I also understand it from a political POV—she needs to win PA to be able to win the election and my guess is she'll strive to work with industry on some kind of incremental shift away from it if she wins. PA is registering more new Rep voters right now than Dem voters. It's tricky.

Content: Just keeping the IRA alone is why everybody who cares about the environment should vote for Harris. If Trump wins he will most likely have a GOP Congress that is promising to repeal it. Even with Democrat control of both chambers Trump can still stop most of it

Content: It’s the first major thing they’ll do if they get both chambers. They’ll get rid of all the money and use it to fund even more tax cuts for the rich and make his tax cuts permanent. Mike Johnson, Steve Scalise, and all of GOP leadership promise it

Content: Hi! Stephanie here. I'm based between US and Italy and have long been engaged in US and international climate & renewables work, including running the Greenpeace global climate & energy program. I've worked on policy for several presidential (and other) campaigns, in case I can help on that front. Happy to do whatever is needed (training, comms, research), particularly if it can be done virtually.

Content: The campaign posted a new issues page: https://kamalaharris.com/issues/. Kudos for placing environmental issues under the "opportunity economy and lower costs" and "Keep America Safe, Secure, and Prosperous" sections. Even some GOP folks want to keep the IRA because it's produced jobs in their districts.

Pete Buttigieg, Deb Haaland, and others spent more time on it at the DNC. For now I'll assume there were/are strategic reasons for the choice. 🤷‍♀️

Content: Hi, I’m from Michigan and currently living in Florida, two states that LOVE their outdoor areas.   (As do I).  Recently our *insert curseword of choice* governor tried to sneak through a proposal to plow under nine state parks to make golf courses and pickleball courts.  When the docs were leaked, there was HUGE and INSTANT bipartisan outrage.  I think emphasizing Project 2025’s elimination of the NOAA, which we all count on to keep us safe from hurricanes, would incur similar bipartisan outrage here, if more people knew.   Would love to do my part to turn Florida blue…it’s already greener than you might think!

Content: United States enjoys 24 hour energy usage in terms of electricity and water. It is one of the few countries with this advantage. if we wish to continue to enjoy such a privelege we need to take action to reduce our energy costs in each home  by promoting reduction in use such as turning off lights when not in use, storing water on site such as rain water for irrigation needs at home, adding green energy support items such as solar panels etc. By reducing energy consumption, we can each help with reduction in energy needed. this will help us to look more into options of generating more energy through wind turbines as our energy consumption reduction, may be used to start the wind turbines, and capture more clean energy.

Content: Yes, it says in right in the text of Prjct 2025 that they think hurricane warnings and similar promote climate change “propaganda.”  It might even say “hysteria,” I’d have to go back and check the wording.

Content: BITD: I interned with the Airspace Systems Project at NASA and some of things the program was researching had to do with weather, air traffic, and fuel efficiency.

Think: Near real-time updates so pilots could find the fastest and safest way through storms and efficiently routing flights from gate to gate.

Not sure how much of that got into any current systems, but from air traffic control to farmer's reports, eliminating and/or privatizing weather data is a terrible idea.

Content: THANK YOU all for coming out to the Climate Voters virtual watch party! (And for putting up with my brat fall fashion jokes!) So grateful to this team for turning out for our future President Harris, and making sure climate voters everywhere know what is on the line in this election. The choice couldn't be clearer. I'm proud to be on #TeamKamala and in movement strength with all of you. 

Great night for Swifties + cat lovers + team planet / sane and responsible leadership!

Content: Since you invited "real talk" about what's keeping us up at night -- I know many of us would LOVE future Pres. Harris to bring some of the prosecutor energy to the fossil barons accountability question and the JOY to speak openly about a visionary post-fossil, post-pollution future. How recovery and regeneration can be BETTER for everyone (with attendant jobs + economy numbers) rather than doubling down on how the US is such a fabulous oil producer. That's what young people & climate folks need to hear to put in ALL the hours.  To be clear, VP did an amazing job - great prep, memorable talking points, presidential presence. AND as a climate voter and a pragmatist, I believe there is space to say more of what needs to be said. 🌎

Content: As someone who'd love to see the US overcome the "red/blue state thing," this article struck me as nicely framed—featuring both CA and TX as leaders in US battery grid rollouts: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-texas-lead-way-us-153320719.html. Other states mentioned are AZ, NV, and FL. "Currently, 19 states do not have any plans to integrate battery power technologies into their electricity system" for fossil fuel usage-related reasons. I wonder if some campaign messaging addressing situations like this would make any sense. The framing I'd use would emphasize KH's "opportunity economy," inviting states that are behind on climate to work together to catch up.

Content: Honestly from an energy diversity perspective it makes us extremely vulnerable to price fluctuations if we just have one or two sources of energy. Adding Solar and wind just makes us that more resilient.

Content: Solar-powered + mobile WiFi/Wi-Max w/battery packs were in use to create mobile wireless mesh networks to conduct scientific studies in Elkhorn Slough.

That was ~20 years ago.

Imagine what we could do with 1) the solar & battery technology we have now to 2) coordinate disaster relief now.

Content: A little about me... I grew up in the suburbs of NYC and went to college at the University of South Carolina (go Gamecocks)! I’m now living in Washington, D.C. and working on climate communications as federal contractor. I am so inspired and energized by the Harris-Waltz campaign and everyone’s new excitement for the future of our country. Looking forward to contributing however I can 🙂

Content: "'Like it or not: Germany's energy system is fully operational, with more than 50% renewables. And we are shutting down – not building – coal & nuclear plants. Coal will be off the grid by 2038 at the latest,' the German Foreign Office wrote on [Twitter]. The ministry ended its message with a swipe at Trump: 'PS: We also don't eat cats and dogs.'" Germany's Foreign Minister is from the Green Party...I wish they were this sassy more often: https://www.dw.com/en/germany-rejects-trumps-energy-claim-mocks-him-over-pets/a-70190020

Content: Project 2025 Climate Policy (note over 140 former Trump admin officials and his former Chief of Staff were involved in creation of it):     

□ Elimination of Climate Change References: Advises eradicating climate change references in government.

□ Environmental Agencies: Proposes downsizing the EPA and abolishing NOAA.

□ Emissions Regulations: Suggests relaxing greenhouse gas emissions regulations and preventing states from implementing stricter vehicular emissions standards.
□ Fossil Fuels: Encourages increased fossil fuel production and opposes renewable energy expansion.
□ Repeals: Plans to repeal climate-related legislations like the Inflation Reduction Act.

Reduction or Elimination of Renewable Energy Subsidies: Project 2025 promotes a shift away from government incentives for renewable energy development.

Government Overhaul: Proposes significant restructuring of federal agencies, advocating for direct presidential control over the federal bureaucracy, including job protections removal for thousands of government employees.

The initiative includes firing over 50,000 federal employees and replacing them with individuals loyal to Trump’s vision, effectively transforming civil service positions into political appointments through the reinstatement of the "Schedule F" executive order.

This plan aims to eliminate civil service protections, allowing for the reclassification of federal workers as political appointees. The proposal also involves dismantling or downsizing various federal agencies, such as the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, and reallocating their functions to other departments or eliminating them entirely.

The overarching goal of Project 2025 is to reshape the federal government to be more responsive to the president's directives, potentially eroding checks and balances and altering the nonpartisan nature of the civil service.

Content: The major scientific groups: Copernicus, NOAA, NASA have said we surpassed 1.64C above pre-industrial levels over the past 12 months . We are now projected to reach the “30-year average” of 1.5C between 2032-2034, 16-18 years ahead of 2050 (Paris Agreement).

Under the Paris Agreement, we must reduce carbon emissions by over 45% by 2030. 

According to the Guardian - Almost 80% of the IPCC scientist respondents foresee at least 2.5C of global heating, while almost half anticipate at least 3C (5.4F).- https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/08/world-scientists-climate-failure-survey-global-temperature

At 1.5C - We have 70-90% loss of coral reefs, 1 million tonnes of fish die, we have a 100% increase in flood risk, 1 billion people are exposed to severe heat waves every 5 years.

At 2.0C - We have one ice-free arctic summer every 10 years, 3 million tonnes of fish die, almost 100% of the coral reefs decline, 2.7 Billion people are exposed to severe heat waves every 5 years and we have a 170% increase in flood risk.

Content: In a recent white paper - Economic damage from climate change six times worse than thought.

A new report released by Adrien Bilal, an economist at Harvard and Diego Känzig, an economist at Northwestern University says:

A 1C increase in global temperature leads to a 12% decline in world gross domestic product (GDP), the researchers found, a far higher estimate than that of previous analyses.

The paper places a much higher estimate on economic losses than previous research, calculating a social cost of carbon, which is the cost in dollars of damage done per each additional ton of carbon emissions, to be $1,056 per ton

A 3C temperature increase will cause “precipitous declines in output, capital and consumption that exceed 50% by 2100” the paper states. This economic loss is so severe that it is “comparable to the economic damage caused by fighting a war domestically and permanently”, it adds.

Content: <@892919921347010591> - One thing I noticed in trying to find the link - 9 pm EST is a little late to be calling in that time zone, but of course, you can call the West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii until 9 pm local time.  Perhaps it's just a typo.  Either way, I found this related to an affiliated climate action org. Since it is on DNC Mobilize, it is okay to post it. https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/653873/

Content: At age 15, I worked at Audubon Canyon ranch helping to educate underprivileged youth about the environment and how our actions have the ability to alter it. I have overseen construction and development of sustainable real estate, worked on the internal corporate sustainability company of one of the largest companies in the world and attended COP28 in Dubai. I regularly read white papers and articles discussing climate change and its impact on the environment and the national and global economy. I study what regulations we can implement to limit warming and help drive sustainable finance to the most effective decarbonization levers.

Content: I have been sending postcards with Environmental Voter Project for the past three cycles. Their postcards campaign is probably complete for this year, but they also do some really deep research into low propensity voters for whom the environment is their top concern. Here's a link to a recent brief on Pennsylvania: https://youtu.be/uMenQPSYpU4?si=PCfsimpbqlWd0hzC

Content: Curious if anyone saw the environmental voter polling re Gen Z climate voters: 40% of Young Voters say they will only support candidates who prioritize climate change — it’s a “deal breaker.” 40% of young voters say that a candidate must prioritize “addressing climate change” or else it is a “deal breaker.” An additional 40% of young voters say they would “prefer” candidates who prioritize addressing climate change.

Content: Young people, such as myself, see a future that we live in with pollution of all kinds. We want it fixed now so we don't have to worry about it when it's worse in 2035_2040

I absolutely think climate should be huge on senate and president this year, the numbers give us close to 6-10 years before we can't turn back, we act now or we get stuck forever.

Content: Mother Jones (can't post link due to a donation button) has a great article underscoring why Harris/Walz are the right ticket for the economy and jobs, including in small towns. The steel plant in Middletown, OH is set to receive $500 mill in IRA funding to produce green steel, but JD Vance is against it. Quote from a local, a political independent: "Democrats have not done well in patting themselves on the back, they need to be out there screaming from the rooftops, ‘This is what we’ve done.’" Phone banking helps with that! 💪

Content: Like how Cruz tried to take credit for working on interstate funding with Warnock as “proof” that he can be bipartisan even though he voted against the final bill. If you have to use an amendment to show you’ve done bipartisan work, you haven’t really been doing bipartisan work.

Content: Not sure if this belongs in <#1268690577960992878> or here, but I just saw that Scientific American endorsed Harris: "for only the second time in our magazine’s 179-year history, the editors of Scientific American are endorsing a candidate for president. That person is Kamala Harris."

Content: Yes Sarah. Per your comment, that stat comes from the Environmental Voter Project’s 2024 Youth Battleground polling. Linking it directly here gets the comment blocked but you can find it on their website. For anyone who hasn’t read it, the report has a lot more than climate info.

Content: Can't link to it because Mother Jones has a donate button (see exchange directly above 😂 ) but they've posted an article titled: "Kamala Harris Framed Climate Action as a Patriotic Duty. New Research Shows Why That’s Effective." Subhed: "Psychologists found that appealing to American values could boost support for environmental measures." It might give folks here some ideas as you phone bank.

Content: I just wanted to share this research I did here too, in hopes that it might help all of you.

Climate Change as known government National Security Threat:
·   "By the late 1980s, official National Security Strategy documents, prepared by the White House to guide the national defense priorities and military strategy, acknowledged the threat to U.S. national security from a broad range of demographic and environmental factors.” -Gleick, 2019
·   Climate change and energy are two key issues that will play a significant role in shaping the future security environment," noting that "climate change, energy security, and economic stability are inextricably linked." -DoD, 2017
·  “We recognize that climate change is a threat to U.S. national security and the well-being of the American people,” Farnan said during a press event Wednesday.” – US Army
· “Climate change has serious implications for national security .. Climate change is dramatically increasing the demand for military operations and, at the same time, impacting our readiness and our ability to meet those demands while imposing unsustainable costs on the department,"- DOD, 2022
o   Climate Change has been recognized as a National Security Threat in several U.S. Military Field Manuals and strategic documents.
· Department of Defense (DoD) Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap (2014)
· National Security Strategy (NSS)
· National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
· Army Field Manual (FM) 3-0, Operations
· Marine Corps Operating Concept (2016)

I went to COP28 in Dubai, and read the Institute for Economics and Peace predicted 1.2B (1/8th of current world pop) people would be permanently or temporarily displaced from Climate Change in 2050. This came from their 2020 Ecological Threat report which was based on the IPCC AR5 report (2014), old data. We already see climate migrants flooding into the UK and EU. Building infrastructure + Buildings to old standards (using old climate data) causes more displacement faster!

Content: I’ve started a campaign aimed at assisting the United Nations Association groups to help them:
1. Drive voter turn out.
2. Educate people within their membership and community about the positions of the candidates in their jurisdiction relative to the UN SDG’s and Local 2030 initiative. 
3. Convey Harris vs. Trump’s position on climate change.
4. Establish targeted campaigns to help increase voter turn out between ages 18-24 (college campuses, social media, etc).

If you are passionate about the UN SDG’s, hitting the Paris Agreement goals and would like to help these groups establish their own program to drive the above, please DM me. 

It would be great if anyone wants to follow suit and target the “climate change” and “sustainability” groups within college campuses and wants to help get them on group calls, so they can leverage one another’s skills to drive voter turn out and awareness. 

Sometimes students need help from “older” people. I am scheduling my first call with them next week. Let me know if you want to join.

Content: Pro Publica (can't link there due to campaign finance laws) has a new article: "EPA Scientists Said They Were Pressured to Downplay Harms From Chemicals. A Watchdog Found They Were Retaliated Against." This happened during the Trump years, and the current Inspector Gen says they were retaliated against. "A second Trump presidency could see more far reaching interference with the agency’s scientific work. Project 2025, the radical conservative policy plan to overhaul the government, would make it much easier to fire scientists who raised concerns about industry influence."

Content: Wanted to throw this in here: I found myself on the phone with an independent voter for nearly 20mins...so special. Essentially, I was really enjoying the conversation, but I wished that I had a few more persuasive/strategic techniques to draw from. I'm wondering if it might be generative to organize an in-depth workshop on persuasive/strategic communication while phonebanking? Happy to offer my time to organize and facilitate. Hoping to follow-up with <@892919921347010591> !

Content: <@1274293080794595339> - Good news. We (mods) got word today that news only sites are allowed even if they have donate buttons or links, but still no political non profits or candidate sites.  So, Pro-Publica, PBS, NPR, Substack etc are allowed in news etc. https://www.propublica.org/.  Environmental non profits are okay here when cited as a source, at least until /unless we get told differently.  Thanks for your patience and understanding.

Content: Most definitely a news-worthy item.  Since climate is a science issue of course, it also belongs here.  Such a good endorsement. 🙂

Content: Heya Jay, that's so cool that you remembered me. <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> 😀 Thank you for the note, and I'm glad to hear about this change. I'll probably just stick to the nonprofit media vs. nonprofit orgs to stay on the safe side.

Content: I work in climate action professionally - see the link to my web page below. I’m currently trying to decide how to communicate with colleagues who are attending Climate Week in New York this week. The basic message would be something like “You’ve been to Climate Week - the single most effective, immediate climate action you can take for the next five weeks is to volunteer with the Harris/Walz campaign. Nothing you discussed during Climate Week will matter if Trump goes back to the White House.” I’m focusing on LinkedIn posts; I have nearly 5,000 followers there. If you think this is a promising strategy, please share your thoughts as to both messaging content and messaging outlets. I’d like to start this up on Thursday, Sept. 26. Https://www.westurb.com

Content: Hi <@353287477601107988> this is a lovely scorecard. and I support you to share a screenshot of it, if you can crop off the donate button, or just describe how other volunteers can find it. Unfortunately that donate button means we need to apply our "no fundraising" rule and remove it.

Content: I think that messaging is great. It's timeboxed, succinct, and pragmatic. I'd include the link to this Discord (https://democrats.org/discord/) at the end so people can join here directly. Are you in the ClimateAction.tech Slack? I just checked and there are 263 members in the "local-new-york channel—you might post there. And maybe if you know any speakers or participating groups with huge followings, they'd also send out?

Content: <@1274293080794595339> I started responding to posts by friends and contacts on Facebook and LinkedIn today, where they mention ClimateWeek. I’m monitoring responsive likes and comments to get a sense of how this is going over. I will do an original post on LinkedIn either Wednesday or Thursday. I’ve been including a link to the general portal for Harris/Walz volunteers. I have not been using Slack but I just pulled it up and found that I could log in and was already registered there on COVolunteerTeam2020, so I will get the app and start checking in there as well. Thanks for these tips. I see you are working in Germany. I have previously served on the General Executive Committee of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability (with offices in Bonn) and have collaborated with the Ecologic Institute Berlin. Thanks for volunteering while overseas!

Content: Yeah but he did some good reforms compared to modern republicans in the 2006 energy bill. Killing Kyoto is unforgivable though. Al Gore could’ve done so much. Our emissions would have peaked way earlier than 2008. McCain did have a climate platform. But anyways that’s the past and we’re against the biggest climate denier ever now

Content: <@820155524598726688> For what it’s worth, I’m still telling people just to text JOIN to 30330, rather than CLIMATE. I am targeting my fellow climate action professionals and mention climate action in my posts and comments, so they know I am targeting them specifically because of their client action work. JOIN should work fine for them.

Content: With Climate Week over I’m hoping to message next week around COP 29. Although it will be held in November after the election, many of those who attend feel so (justifiably) guilty about flying around the world to a climate conference in an oil producer (Azerbaijan) that they feel compelled to buy carbon offsets. But offsets are increasingly unreliable. My concept is to suggest that the best “offset” COP attendees can do is a donation to Harris/Walz. “How will you feel at COP29 if Trump has won and you didn’t donate when you could have? And how nice would it be to brag about donating to Harris/Walz if they have won?” Any thoughts? And would anyone else like to join me in coordinated messaging on this?

Content: The Inflation Reduction Act was passed through a compromise that allowed some incentives for fossil fuel projects. The incentives for clean energy are larger and out-weigh the dirty energy. Putting bans on things is political suicide. So if there can be a phase out through investment and innovation, that would be great. We will have to stop drilling and burning though but getting Harris into office and then having that conversation will be better than the alternative.

Content: That does not address the climate crisis. This is more of a systemic problem however. Further that is the backward looking strategy this is about what she does once she is in office. This is not about undermining Harris but more focused on saying if they answer those questions they would be able to slam dunk the election. For example you have today Harris: We need to do something about the climate crisis vs Trump: How do you do it without raising taxes drill baby drill. In contrast it could be Harris: If we can use Green energy to fund UBI, eliminate income taxes for middle and lower incomes, and fix healthcare but you can only do it through green energy. Trump: They're eating their CAAAAATS!!!

But rather than cut them off at the knees this time you advocated for talking about it next cycle. Sure dont BAN fracking but the fossil fuel industry is run on government subsidies.

Content: I’m sorry but I need to state that we need to lift up the IRA and BIP because they are historic climate achievements that are helping. I know cuz I work with these grants and projects. Please don’t assume I know nothing of policy. People think nothing gets done in DC and we need to push back by saying Harris has already got things done and will do more. I would also like a more detailed plan on climate. But I’m not gonna say she is the same old thing or won’t do anything different.

Content: People assume nothing gets done in DC because they have heard the same future faking for decades. I did not say Harris is the same old thing my being here says otherwise. I am saying your response is the same old thing. If you do voter outreach responses of "Actually" followed by the willful dismissal of observable fact is more of the same. I am not saying you dont know any policy I am saying you dont know enough policy or its history to understand how "We can discuss that after the election" is just more of the Clintonian "Its the economy stupid" that gave cover for nakedly neoliberal trickledown eonomic policies that make the Democratic party the party of the condenscending elite in the eyes of rural voters. If we want to move rural areas from red to blue we need to be able to answer their concerns BEFORE the election not after. After all as we are constantly reminded every day "Democracy is at stake" so if there was ever a time to speak to rural and older generations problems the arguement you use with young will not play with the old.

Content: <@539238883280551966> the scripts are shared in the training, I encourage you to attend training, if the script doesn't align with your beliefs you can leave the training. 
I suggest another way to volunteer which may align with your ideals would be through Reach, where you can choose from a library of content. I will send you the info for Reach now.

Content: Hi <@771560612186161172> - The issues page emphasizes lower energy costs, but you can take any issue in the list on the issues page and extrapolate a tie in to the environment or climate change.  https://kamalaharris.com/issues/.  Thanks for your good question.

Content: Agreed - so green construction, green energy, green jobs.  Obviously, issues page is general by design, but as an engager.  You can construct posts that elaborate on the policies listed from a climate point of view.

Content: Powerful remarks from President Biden today:
> “In a moment like this, we put politics aside. At least, we should put it all aside — we have here. There are no Democrats or Republicans, there are only Americans. And our job is to help as may people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can.”
> 
> “No one can deny the impact of climate crisis anymore. At least I hope they don’t, they must be brain dead if they do. Scientists report that with warming oceans powering more intense rains, storms like Helene are getting stronger and stronger. They’re not going to get less, they’re going to get stronger.”

Content: Where I am in Tennessee, many people are realizing that the climate crisis will not spare us simply for being 500+ miles inland. Yesterday, I was running deliveries of water and groceries down the road, to towns where every bridge over the Nolichucky is gone, entire livelihoods gone, and even lives lost. This is a key opportunity for us to focus on what Harris and Walz will do to course-correct and protect our communities and our ecosystems, and to reverse the effects of climate change. Ideally, we would have a one-page infographic that addresses the devastation down here, the basics of climate change, and what the Harris-Walz administration will do to address these issues. This would allow us to connect with our community over this crisis and use it to create real, lasting change.

Content: Fully agreed. Our governor, Bill Lee, did not declare a state of emergency until after the damage was done. There are towns down the road from here that are virtually wiped off the map. There is a lot of criticism of the government response here, and a clear message from the Harris-Walz campaign would be influential.

Content: I need help understanding how everything is going to work as the disasters get worse and happen more frequently, yet we have states and cities that refuse to acknowledge that climate change is real. They refuse to invest the money to make their cities resilient and to use the latest climate risk maps. Should we give everyone our federal and state tax dollars equally despite the fact that some refused to invest to make their cities resilient and to save their citizens?

Trump wants to delete the words climate change from all government documents. The appointed GOP people will likely try to do the same in the states they govern and are the Senator or House of Representatives for. 

When we discuss the cost of Trump’s plans, we need to factor in all the extra money we will need to give to FEMA and the U.S. military to save people after these major events get worse and more intense.

Content: I agree we have to give money right now but that’s not sustainable. 

If Trump were to take office and delete climate change from gov’t docs, perform significant cuts to FEMA and allow for cities and roads to be built using old code, the cost to fix it after combined with the damage from the intensifying storms would be significant. This is all the more reason why he can never take office and we have to win the Senate and the House, in addition to Presidency in as many states as possible. We cannot continue to build and rebuild these cities using old climate risk maps and old code just to save money while doing so. People’s lives are at stake. When people are displaced after the major disaster’s it has a significant impact on the economy. 

The GOP states haven’t had any problem taking funding from the IRA.

Content: We need our roads and bridges built to the latest code and using the latest climate risk maps. That’s what NOAA and the IRA helped do over the past 4 years. 

Everyone impacted by the storms needs to realize that if they want to be saved, the roads and bridges need to be built using the latest flood maps, otherwise what happened here will continue to happen. They can’t lobby their politicians to use old code (just because it’s more profitable for the developers), which leads to more death, destruction and economic destruction.

Content: I mean some Republicans will take money for climate resilience projects but there will definitely be some that reject it. Obviously they’re more likely to accept the construction of a new bridge or factory than a climate resilience project. It’ll probably be closer to Medicaid expansion where many republicans accept the help but some will reject it anyways, even if it’s popular

Content: Here’s an excellent post from Zurich insurance discussing the threat called out by the Institute for Economics and Peace’s projection that 1.2B people (1/8th of the current world pop) being displaced by 2050 (26 years from now) poses: https://www.zurich.com/media/magazine/2022/there-could-be-1-2-billion-climate-refugees-by-2050-here-s-what-you-need-to-know

Note, the amount of people displaced from climate change grows from its current number to 1.2B. It grows faster if emissions continue to rise. That’s why it’s essential we do everything we can to vote in a President, Senators and House of Rep’s that not only care but are doing something to actively reduce emissions! 

Our national security is at stake!

Content: Yes but it would cost votes in Pennsylvania since fracking is heavy there. My home state isn’t one of the crucial 7 states but it could be vital for the senate, and there’s also a lot of fracking here. It’s lead to minor earthquakes in DFW

Content: I also personally support a ban on fracking but Kamala’s been trying to position herself as moderate. Helps because she can easily be painted as very progressive due to being from the Bay Area (Being in Texas, I’m pretty used to hearing California-bashing) and being a woman of color (women and POC are implicitly perceived as being further to the left)

Content: <@853062002871369759> It's possible. Am not expert in these bot matters. But the Harris campaign really ought to continue trying to engage on this. All the young adults I know are upset by the perceived relative lack of attention -- doesn't mean necessarily that they won't vote (most are aware of the importance) , but it's difficult to connect with them on the issue.

Content: OK, I’m going to make a personal plea here.  ☀️ 🌴 

I participate with several Florida groups:  FL Victory 2024, Orange County Dems, Florida Women for Harris, and more.   And blue Florida has been working its a$$ off to get our state, and the country, the electoral votes and the blue wave that the Harris/Walz team needs.  🌊 In some cases, people are putting themselves at personal risk to do this, because you know how it can be putting yourself out there publicly in deep red territory.  (Or you can imagine).  And these folks are doing it ALL!  Canvassing, sign waving, postcarding, house parties, information tables, post-its on restroom doors, and more.  We’re out there for education and equality and the climate and reproductive rights every single day.   And you want to talk phone banking?  Florida has had its own equivalent of Dawn to Dusk Dialing for MONTHS, and I get sent new dialer links almost daily because of all the good folks hammering through those lists like nobody’s business.  

But Florida is still recovering from Helene and now Milton is on its way.  I’m typing this now from an area predicted to be in the direct path (but not under evacuation orders, because we obey those and we listen to facts, not nonsense).  People are doing their best but they are scared.  We don’t know what’s coming.  And in addition to whatever we face, we may lose power for days or weeks in the tropical heat, and that’s no joke.

That means the campaign work in Florida has to be put on hold while we deal with survival.  

So, please, if you’re grateful to have a roof over your head and chilled food in the refrigerator and a grocery store that’s stocked and power for your devices, take a few extra minutes in the next few days and make some extra calls.  Make up the slack for what Florida wants to do and can’t.  

And we’ll be right back in there to help as soon as we’re on our feet again.  Because that’s what we do for each other in a world that cares.  Thank you!

Content: Yes the infrastructure of campaign work - the relationships, the training, the tools, for phone banking and canvassing and rallies and GOTV - is the same infrastructure needed for disaster recovery. Let's keep everyone safe and connected and show each other why we care so much about the future of this nation. That counts as campaign work too

Let’s please get all of the Nat’l Security advisors and former Trump gov’t officials who endorsed Kamala to take a stand on Climate Change and the Nat’l Security threat that it poses!

Content: Yikes! I knew Trump wanted to exit the Paris Agreement, delete climate change from all U.S. gov’t docs, repeal the IRA, decrease funding to the DOE and EPA but pulling out of the World Bank and IMF too? 

https://greencentralbanking.com/2024/10/04/trump-paris-agreement-global-green-transition-efforts/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=news
 
 “Meanwhile a conservative guide called Project 2025 with ties to Trump has outlined its wish for the US to pull out of global financial institutions, including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund “and terminate its financial contribution to both institutions”.

Withdrawing from the development banks could have large implications for low-income countries as the US is the largest shareholder of the World Bank. While the green transition isn’t just the only issue that multilateral development banks contribute financing to, it is an issue that many American conservative politicians have pushed against.”

Content: I was just saying that’s why I believe she changed her stance. Not banning fracking could also cost votes, although it would probably affect less votes in the crucial states, and also each change would have half the effect of someone switching their vote to Trump. I don’t like how many of my personal stances would be unpopular, but we have to work with the electorate we’ve got

Content: IIRC most people in PA don't support fracking. She is probably betting that if someone doesn't support fracking then she will have that person's vote regardless of whether or not she supports fracking.

She probably thinks that she can get more voters by changing her position on this

Content: Nice, also, the one good thing I can say that Ron DeSantis state was approving the increase of Florida’s reliance on nuclear energy, even if he didn’t do it for the correct reasons he still did it, and credit where it’s due, even if the rest of his governorship has been a trainwreck

Content: I wanted to share this latest article from The NY Times talking about how Trump rolled back climate resiliency across the U.S. states, so everyone understands what is on the line: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/climate/trump-flood-protection-rules-infrastructure.html

Also remember, he wants to get rid of FEMA, delete any reference to “climate change” in all gov’t docs, exit the Paris Agreement, UNFCC, World Bank, IMF, immediately repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and substantially increase Int’l tariffs, potentially setting off trade wars with others, including China. 

If you want to understand how bad our country currently is in protecting us against climate change because of all the lobbying and what cities face the biggest risk, check out FEMA’s building resilience tracker: https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/building-science/bcat.

We cannot afford to roll back climate resilience regulations/standards in the various U.S. cities or states. It’s proven GOP led states and cities use older codes. We need as many of them using the latest 2024 building code, energy code and green construction code possible. We need the cities engineered to withstand the latest risk called out in the most up to date climate risk maps from NOAA, NASA, Berkeley Earth. 

Allowing us to build cities to outdated codes and outdated climate risk maps (flooding, fire, drought/heat, intensifying storms and sea level rise) will compromise our ability to save lives and limit the destruction. 

There are three justices in their 70’s with two likely to retire in the next election. We cannot have the GOP have more control of the Supreme Court as we argue about who is to blame, who needs to pay, and what happens with water rights. 

The extreme heat will bring droughts and cause water/food shortages and cripple our electricity grids (A/C demand). We need control of the House, Senate and Presidency!

We also need to ensure the voters also focus on the judges in their areas!

Content: “This is a huge investment. We are really seeing its impacts,” said Jackie Wong, a senior advisor to the NRDC Action Fund, an environmental political advocacy group that has endorsed Kamala Harris. “This isn’t just about climate. This is also about public health and about jobs and about revitalizing American manufacturing.”

Trump and his advisers and spokespeople have said he would seek to roll back the law’s spending, a step Wong said “would be devastating for climate and economic health.”

Thank you for having me. Today I'd like to discuss a topic so terrifying, grown men turn away in fear. They speak of it only vaguely, if at all, tiptoeing around anything that sounds too gloomy or doomy or alarming.

Look, it’s no secret why Donald maintains an outdated dirty energy policy, and it’s not because he actually believes that pouring gas on a planet on fire is going to do any good. No, Donald made a deal with the devil. The man is so soaked in oil money his climate plan is drill baby drill. You hear it at every rally - "drill baby drill." Where is he drilling? Graveyards.

You know, things rarely work out well for graverobbers. The carcasses they call “fossil fuels” serve a purpose: they keep carbon out of the air so the planet remains stable. That's our carbon vault. Eons in the making, this natural wonder brought us the world we know and love, that farmers know and love, because agriculture requires a stable climate with predictable weather patterns. Farmers need to know when to plant their crops, when to harvest, when to expect rain and sunshine and tolerable temperatures. Given what we stand to lose, perhaps we ought to keep it as the lord intended.

It’s easy to take a stable climate, and the agriculture it enables, for granted. It’s the kind of thing you don’t notice till it’s gone. Look, I’ll level with you - fossil fuels are bad for farmers, and what’s bad for farmers is bad for everyone who needs to eat to stay alive.

Content: The Fossil Fuel Ghoul - I mean, industry - has certainly been busy. A hundred years of setting fire to the planet’s carbon vault has left an enormous cloud of corpses hanging in the sky. It’s disgusting. I mean, come on, fossil fuels are bodies we burn and breathe. I don't know about you, but I’d rather not fill my lungs with ancient corpse soup coughed up from hell.

Fortunately we no longer have to. With clean energy on the table, Donald's dirty energy policy is an odd choice. I've got news for you buddy: we don't need to do that anymore. We have the technology to bottle sunshine, a gust of wind, a wave in motion. What use do we have for the barbaric practice of burning bodies for energy?

Energy systems have their youth and their age. Sure, fossil fuels brought us the advances of the past century, but they can carry us no further. I mean, an infant is well served by diapers - that doesn’t mean the child ought to stay in them forever. Old technology is replaced by the new. It’s the way of the world.

Still, old Donald knows his keeper, he knows his role: a geriatric candidate peddling a geriatric fuel. His climate plan is clear: let it burn. He goes even further, insulting America, telling her she is too weak to lead the world in this energy crisis, too weak to use clean energy technology she already has - technology she invented, tools she built. When will she be stronger? Will it be next week or in the next decade? Opportunity is here now, clear and shining. Powerful and offensive actions can and must be taken. The policy we offer is simple and straightforward: we’ve got the tools - we’re going to use them.

We're not going back. We're not going back to archaic fuels and we're not going back to a time before stability, a time before agriculture. Because when the world is under attack, we fight back. That’s who we are as Americans - we fight back. And when we fight? “We win!”

Content: 👋 Hey Climate engagement team! 👋 

Thank you for everything you do! I was sent here by our lead mods for a very special ask, and I hope you’ve got the time to listen.

In addition to your work protecting our environment and reaching out to voters, we’d like you to help us by making **calls** ☎️!

As all of you know, calling voters in swing states is a **top priority** so close to the election, and its the best way to make a difference unless you live in / can commute to a swing state; this applies to overall **and** to protecting our environment!

We set a goal for phone calls today. We’re 300,000 calls behind that goal, and today is a particularly vital day to our efforts. Why? 

# Early voting starts today in Wisconsin!

Wisconsin has also been heavily affected by pollution and environmental factors in the Great Lakes, which is an excellent talking point to mention in your talks with voters.

We’re only 14 days away from the election, and we need to try and shatter turnout records for <:KamalaTanSuit:1275479319640150146> + <:WalzSmile:1270424129853456445> !!

🎉 🎉  Join the party in <#1242256751445934262> now!!🎉 🎉 

Thank you all for listening to Michele Obama’s call to **do something!** Let’s save our country **and** our environment! Thank you!

Content: We need YOU **to make calls tonight** into Arizona! If you need any motivation as to how urgent this is--when JD Vance was in AZ earlier, he refused to confirm whether he would commit to accepting the election results. To make sure that this doesn't happen--help us call AZ voters and make sure they have a plan to vote now! Hop on here: https://events.democrats.org/event/704955/
