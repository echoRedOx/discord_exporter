  content: 'I''m not trained as a KC, but I was helping out with a reshifting list,
    which after it finished pointed me at: "H4H Recruitment_101224_ Type: Recruitment".
    I''m delighted to work on that, but I''m not sure I''ve been approriately trained
    to answer possible questions from hosts. Where should I ask about this?'
