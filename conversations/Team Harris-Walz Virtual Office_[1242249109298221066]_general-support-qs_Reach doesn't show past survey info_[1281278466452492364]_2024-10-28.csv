Is there any way to allow me to see what I submitted? Without the ability to see the details of what I submitted, I have no reason to submit Reach surveys. I have at least 10 Facebook Groups and about 10 other online platforms (X, Threads, TikTok, LinkedIn, Reddit, Nextdoor, Instagram, Substack, Truth Social, YouTube etc) to engage, which takes a lot of time just to keep track of my engagements. So now I have to create my own spreadsheet to keep track and avoid duplicate efforts. Wouldn't it be easier for Reach to allow me to see my own survey report submissions? Thank you."

My understanding of the survey reports in Reach are that they use those internally to notice trends and such. I'm not sure if any staff here could ask the team who manages the Reach app about this, but someone should see it and hopefully let you know here if there's anything else we might be able to do. Thank you for your online engagement for the campaign! You're doing a great job!"

I will create my Google Sheet and share it with somebody on the team in the future instead of submitting Reach reports each time. Thx!
