I tried filling out a form for the Harris campaign but it is not letting me submit - says it looks like spam.  

PLEASE - this would be a serious MISSED OPPORTUNITY to communicate with voters.    i know people who use these tools as their source of info (esp local races) and they say it influences their vote if the candidate didn't answer the questions.   (thankfully Trump didn't answer either.  in PA senate race - Casey answered, McCormick didn't..... 

Can someone get a message to the campaign to look into it?   I've reached out to Vote411 as well."
