  content: I recently completed text training for the Kamala Harris virtual office.  I'm
    already a texter in the Gavin Newsome virtual office and Scale to Win (Spoke).  I
    got a link from a moderator to log in or create an account for Scale To Win for
    Harris texting.  When I initiate the link and try to log in it says the password
    may be wrong.  I tried to change the password by asking for a link to be sent
    to my email address.  It says it sent it, but I'm not receiving it and it isn't
    in SPAM.  Please help!

  content: Hi Debby!  Welcome to the server, and to this lovely group of volunteers.  You
    should have access to <#1266829704204386334> .  A moderator there should be able
    to help you further, or you could continue the conversation with the moderator
    who sent you the original link.

    if I have a problem with sending DM's.

  content: Oh!  And you apparently need to select "Text Voters in Key States" in the
    customize section of <id:customize>  to get access to <#1266829704204386334> .  Sorry
    about that omission!
