Content: If a call recipient has a question for which I don't have an answer, or if they need additional help that I can't provide, is there a way to communicate that to someone who can provide what they need?   I haven't seen anything like that in the scripts or the S2W user interface.

Content: Sorry if this duplicates, but "flag followup" didn't find anything relevant.

Content: Hi <@610587368654766090> if possible, it would be best to ask the question in the Zoom chat when you are on the dialer, I know that is a bit complicated with the tech of Zoom + dialer, but it's one way to get an answer in the moment when you are talking to the person on the phone, it will also help our team know what to add to the script for future callers.

Content: Oh, boy.   I was assuming I didn't need to be in the Zoom, having been to one training.   Tabbing between the apps isn't too bad, but if I try to wait for responses on Zoom, it is going to make the call recipient's  experience VERY disjointed. I was hoping for a way to get them a followup call with more detailed assistance.  There's no way to do that, then?

Content: My mistake, I assumed you were in zoom, some folks do ask mid-call questions there and we try to get them answers asap, but i agree it can be disjoined. You can certainly do this on your own and the best path to get support would be https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1263529508300914809

Content: <@568257600228032512> Thanks, Carolyn!   One other thing ... is there a way I can unlock the "followup" textbox that sends voting info, so that I can customize the text in response to questions?   Example: I just had a fervent supporter ask where to find genuine (not bootlegged) T-shirts, and it would have been great to be able to C+P the URL into the text in the app.

Content: Thanks, <@568257600228032512>;  the meta-question is, is there any way I can customize the followup text I send to the voter in the ScaleToWin web app?

Content: Similarly, is there any way I can add a brief free text to the  survey feedback.   EXAMPLE:  I spoke to a gentleman who's not voting because he's not a citizen.  Some way to pass info like that to the folks who maintain the lists would be good.

Content: You cannot edit the text to be sent on the dialer. There is a section on the debrief form where you can note specific issues. These are reviewed by staff.

Content: I didn't realize this was sent in a follow up pre-scripted text. However, you can answer these questions when you are speaking to them on the phone.

Content: I had same question about flagging someone for follow up. I got someone yesterday who was leaning Trump who was very unsure and I didn’t feel like I convince him, but I felt like someone else might be able to. We had to end the conversation because he was going to Whole Foods and it just pulled up in his car. But he had his three-year-old daughter in the car and I felt like he’d be open to some persuasion. But I didn’t find any way to have him be followed up with
