I am currently living in Massachusetts after many years in California. In 2004 and 2008, my family used to take me up to New Hampshire to see the candidates speak and to volunteer. I’m mostly doing online stuff with this distributed organizing team this year from home, but depending on how things go I may come up to NH to help (or at least tell my parents to). I’ve also signed up to work on the NH voter protection hotline from home. Anyway, just here to say hi for now! I’ve already been to the Manchester and Nashua offices once and done a couple NH virtual discussion events so have met some people, but not many yet."

I was wondering if there are any initiatives happening in NH with college students- specifically with registering students to vote (most should be eligible to vote in NH by November I think) and/or targeting NH students attending college out of state with how to request absentee ballots? That’s where I’d really like to volunteer my time!

Sununo has a bill on his desk that will make an original birth cert or passport required for same-day registration and eliminates affidavits to waive the requitlrement. It's unclear if he'll sign it in time for it to be in place for Nov, but it's something to watch. When We All Vote is a nationwide group founded by Michelle Obama (I think) that targets young voters. I'm not sure which state level organizations are specifically working this. Maybe 603Forward?"

- We are still in voter identity time. This means we are looking for people have been voters in the past and who were unaffiliated, or who have voted Democrat in the past, but may not be diehard Dems. This is very common in NH. 
- There were a lot of voters who were undecided. Speaking to voters is very important. Marile was great at talking about Project 2025, I pushed that VP Harris was in New Hampshire last week speaking about her Economic Plan and the local news have done a great deal of coverage of the event. (Thankfully, NH has a lot of very active local newspapers). 
- Yes, there were some Tr-mp supporters (mostly men) who answered the door and wouldn't give the wives space to speak. There were also men who just didn't answer the door, despite us seeing them inside. Yes, I would rather speak to the obnoxious Tr-mp voter who literally shouted at us. At least he told me who he was. He didn't intimidate me, and frankly, he looked very small next to his big truck. 
- Favorite homes? The small family farmer whose 4 people in the household would be supporting Kamala Harris ... I picked up some local honey from her farm stand. And the woman who had just come home from a vacation in the Poconos and was thrilled to see me with my Kamala Harris and NH Democrats literature. ""Thank goodness you are here!"" 
- It felt great to walk and knock. We need more door knockers. We are going to be finishing Voter ID time and moving into persuasion time soon. And we need YOU to knock knock knock."
