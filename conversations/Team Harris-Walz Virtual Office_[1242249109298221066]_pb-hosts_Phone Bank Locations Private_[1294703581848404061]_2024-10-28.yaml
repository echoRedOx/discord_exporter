  content: <@1290146855417675778>  - It looks like you named the event as a cafe,
    but it seems like a private, small space.  Either way, we usually send the address
    only to people who RSVP.  Thanks again.

  content: Also, <@1290146855417675778> are you saying all of your events are not
    phone banks? If so, you will need to delete them. We don't officially host postcard
    parties through the campaign but you can set up your own event

  content: No, only the the events listed Thurs-Sunday from 12-4 are NOT phonebanks.  The
    Sunday events from 2-4 pm ARE phonebanks.  And I have logged onto Mobilize to
    edit the events and it won't let me change anything.  All it lets me do is email
    my registered guests.  I have emailed the organizers to ask how to make changes
    but  no one has responded to me

  content: <@782870341445353522>   I believe the events were created by Paula Robinson
    Deare and her email address is prdeare@eworkstyle.com.  I have recently made contact
    with her so I will see if she can make the changes and if not, I will get back
    to you.  Sorry for all the confusion.  I appreciate your patience.
