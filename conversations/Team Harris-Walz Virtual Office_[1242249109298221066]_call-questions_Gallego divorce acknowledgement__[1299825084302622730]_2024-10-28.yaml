  content: Strong Harris supporter and former Dem volunteer who said she **would not**
    vote for Gallego because she saw a commercial about him presenting divorce papers
    as his (now ex) wife was giving birth. I saw stories about the papers being unsealed
    and not containing anything notable. Other than noting how awful and dangerous
    Kari Lake is, any suggestions for gracefully addressing this? Only came up once
    thankfully, and reported via debrief.

  content: <@795140291241181195> Yes, this is a touchy one. I researched this a little
    to see what I could find. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news org
    sued to get the divorce papers released. Kate Gallego has said their divorce records
    formalized how the couple would raise their son apart from each other. Both expressed
    worry that public disclosure of the records could endanger the boy. There was
    nothing to hide in regards to the details. They did get divorced when she was
    pregnant, not while giving birth. I guess I would just say that the story was
    misleading about the timing, and he gave the reason for the divorce that PTSD
    from serving in Iraq put a strain on their marriage which is unfortunate, but
    it doesn't make him a bad guy.
