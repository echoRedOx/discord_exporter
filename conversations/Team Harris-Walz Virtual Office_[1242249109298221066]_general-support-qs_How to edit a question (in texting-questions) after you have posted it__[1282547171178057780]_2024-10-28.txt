Content: Sometimes the edit option is in the three dots drop down menu, and sometimes not. Sometimes, when I right click on the title of a message on the list on the left of the screen, I get a menu that includes an edit option, and sometimes a shorter menu without the edit option. I don't think I'm doing anything differently, but it could be that I am. Is there a more reliable way to get to an edit option? Thanks!

Content: Hey Laura! I *think* the difference (and best way to edit a question) is that you have to click into your post and do the three dots drop down menu to edit it. Versus right clicking on the title of the post (like the big box of your question in <#1259238714157305936>). Does that help?
