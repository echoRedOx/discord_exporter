Content: I am in the same boat, they can add you to the Pennsylvania channel.

There isn‚Äôt much organizing for in person events currently in that channel, though.

Let me know what you find, I am planning to go down to PA a few weekends and canvass or do whatever needs to be done!

Content: Does it seem to anyone else that it's more difficult to get any staff to pick up the phone at any of Schumer's or Gillebrand's offices since the pandemic? The republican house rep still has staff answering the phones usually). I remember it being easier in the past

Content: I do recall having an easy time getting to my then-house-rep to complain about the utter fail of messaging w.r.t. the no-excuse abstentee ballot bill failing, which was why trying and failing to even *leave a message* for Hochul's office frustrated me so much.

Content: Dr. Benay, I directly messaged you but wanted to say to the larger NY community - I am running a voter registration effort in Westchester that is putting up tables in under-served communities as well as organzing carpools of people to help register college students in Pennsylvania. Reach out to me at registervoters @ protonmail.com and I will tell you more.

Content: Hi, I'm Caroline Cao. I'm a freelance entertainment journalist based in Manhattan (and I'm looking for employment and gigs due to the industry lay-offs but that's another story). While I'm registered to vote in Galveston County, Texas, I do fight for Harris and downballots in my New York State area. I also was involved in the 2019 fight for ranked choice voting for NYC. If only Republicans weren't so determined and pouring money in misinformation, New York State would have voted for redistricting and same-day-voter-registration in 2021! 

In my spare time, I also design Canva about the New York State Equal Rights Amendment on the ballot since the NYS fights to codify abortion rights while expanding protections to age, disability, ethnicity, LGBTQ+, and national origins. #VoteYesOnProp1 #FlipYourBallot.

 I also know that NYC voters have 5 ballot proposals to vote on as well.

I am also a writer and member of the Vietnamese community. Do we have any Vietnamese Harris supporters here? Unfortunately, large populations of  Vietnamese Americans are ardent Republican-Trump supporters and are exposed to disinformation campaigns about Kamala Harris. So Vietnamese (and fellow  Asians) should connect with me.**

** I am looking for those to volunteer their translation support for Canva ads. And I want to talk WhatsApp engagement because so many Asian communities engage in politics (and misinformation) in WhatsApp.**

And I do think it's important for non-Asians to be aware of the disinformation amuck in our communities and ask how to fight it.

We also would need help to spread awareness of the New York State Prop 1: Equal Rights Amendment / Amendment to Protect Against Unequal Treatment, because there's so much terrible well-funded transphobic and anti-choice rhetoric against it.

Content: <#1268377860650045551> Dems in Queens County, there needs to be both messaging and action on migrant issues. Roosevelt Ave, and the surrounding areas with prostitution and illegal vendors , affects a number of districts ‚Äî Jackson Heights, Woodside, Elmhurst ‚Äî and while he was a joke, as a Dem in Bayside, Santos‚Äô win was no fluke, because the candidate who replaced him is a moderate Dem. 

TLDR: Staten Island is a known red borough, but the tailwinds right now don‚Äôt look good in Queens‚Äî especially with the investigations surrounding the Adams administration

Content: I hope it's okay to share here. There will be a Buffalo March for Harris on Oct 19 as part of "Show Up". It's a FB group of women that are for Harris and are organizing the event Oct 19. It's unofficial, but if you are in WNY you can join the FB page. We hope to have voter registration, a march in downtown buffalo, and other outreach opportunities. There might be one in Rochester and NYC too. We are organizing across several states.

Content: Received some info from Dems Abroad ("state chapter" of Dems overseas) today: "Ballots will be sent out starting this Saturday, Sept. 21!" So if you know NY folks voting abroad, maybe let them know they should get a ballot soon. Dems Abroad is also hosting a "NY voting info and action meeting" this Thursday, Sept. 19, at 11AM EST/5PM CEST.  "Find out what you need to know to ensure your vote is counted.  This year is different. Don't miss this chance to get answers to your questions." I'm not linking to the site due to campaign finance laws, but you can find the link via their "Events" tab.

Content: Hey all: I saw a post on LinkedIn about a Sept. 23 "Climate for Kamala" fundraiser in NYC featuring Tim Walz and Jay Inslee (Gov of WA), organized by the Harris Victory Fund. I think it's OK for me to post a link here, but will wait till a mod gives the OK (campaign finance laws).

Content: My NYC roommates are liberal voters. I did also have this earnest conversation about being aware of downballots this November, because voting for the right downballots builds the right infrastructure for a Harris presidency (even if the campaign itself hasn't endorsed to local races).

For example, I talked to them about the pro-abortion, pro-LGBTQ+, pro-disability Equal Rights Amendment / Amendment Against Unequal Treatment on the STATEWIDE Prop 1 ballot. One of them, a particular Harris voter, was surprised to learn that the right to reproductive health isn't really codified (unless voting in the State ERA might change that.)

And for New York CITY voters, there's even more talk about the "Charter Revision Commission Adopts Ballot Proposals" on the NYC ballot.

Content: I was in Harlem today canvassing for the pro-choice Prop 1: Equal Rights Amendment in New York State. My 3-person group wasn't so lucky finding people at home, or some potential voters moved out. There was some confusion over some addresses being stores instead of apartments too. Another group was a little more fortunate to find people.

We definitely talked about how we feel NY Democrats didn't put enough money and investment, as if they just assumed New Yorkers would just vote for it.

Content: Does anyone know if you can join a canvassing in PA if you don't take the organized bus and instead drive yourself there? I'm seeing options to canvass in PA but they all seem to involve taking a bus there with a group, but I'm able to drive and let someone else have the bus seat. Can I still join the canvassing with the bus group?

Content: Sorry to hear that. Maybe they invited people in the order they rsvped? I actually just got a call to confirm my attendance, so maybe they‚Äôll open more spots if anyone turns it down?

Content: <@804948269473333259> yeah, I'm worried about the same thing! Did you RSVP through the email or text? I kind of can't imagine they'd have sent the confirmation text if there weren't spots open so maybe they're just doing the emails in batches?

Content: Yeah, I never got the invite email but RSVPed to a text immediately yesterday at 4 pm and got an email confirmation. Then I got the text this morning and replied "YES" right away! So weird.

Content: We will maintain democratic leadership in NY.  Would like to see Adam's step down.  He's too close to center for my liking.  We need a more liberal democrat to grab the reigns and get this city on the right track.  However, let's get Harris elected and get an awesome blue wall set up across America and then we can get a fresh blue look here in nyc on local levels.

Content: On this day 4 years ago, a record 3.3 million Americans cast their ballot early.  And as expected, only 1.7 million early votes have been cast (a 45% decrease).  Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/\

Content: There will be an unofficial March for Democracy in support of Harris/Walz downtown Buffalo on Saturday October 19.  Starting at 1:30 p.m., we will be marching from Niagara Square through downtown. EVERYONE in WNY should come on out. We will also be doing voter registration. It's been a mess trying to get this organized, but it's a nationwide effort to get excitement for the Harris campaign. We are hoping to have at least 100 women show up from the region. If you are local, we are doing a poster night this Monday to get materials ready for the march.

Content: Hey everyone!  I had a great time today canvassing in PA. I‚Äôd like to go back next weekend. I will be driving to / from the Bucks county office. Since we will going via a private vehicle, they are hoping that from there we can go a little deeper into the county. The drawback to going deeper into the county is that we will encounter more undecided & trump supporters. Is anyone interested in joining me either Saturday or Sunday?

Edited to add please DM me if you are interested. TY

Content: Hello Everyone! Just posting a reminder/FYI:

It's time to get on the bus, and get out the vote!

Join New York for Harris as we partner with the official Harris/Walz campaign to launch free bus trips to get out the vote in Pennsylvania.

Buses will depart on Saturdays from:
Harlem
The Bronx
Brooklyn
Queens
Rochester
Buffalo
Binghamton
Westchester
AND some Sundays (see website) through Election Day.

Visit https://newyorkforharris.com/ to register and for information on how to organize a group trip for 20 or more.

IF YOU ARE IN QUEENS/LONG ISLAND: please direct message me with your email address.  I know someone that is coordinating a bus from that area on Saturday, October 19th @ 8am and can connect them to you.

Onward to a New Way Forward! üôåüèæüòä

You should be good to sign up to volunteer for Josh Riley and any other volunteer activity on mobilize now. Thank you so much for being here!

Content: I volunteer in the email channel too, we get that question from supporters a lot (if you can meet up with the bus at arrival)  and we direct them to ask the organizer. I'm not 100% sure of the outcome, but we are still directed do that so I believe it works out!

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

If you need any motivation as to how urgent this is--when JD Vance was in AZ earlier, he refused to confirm whether he would commit to accepting the election results. To make sure that this doesn't happen--help us call AZ voters and make sure they have a plan to vote now!

Content: I‚Äôm finding adding Prop 1 information (and Vote Yes!) very helpful with GOTV in NY 16/17/18. Especially with women voters. As soon as people  hear ‚Äúenshrining reproductive freedom into the NYS Constitution‚Äù they are ready to run to the polls. I think the coordinated campaign is really working well for us here. I‚Äôll be in 17 this weekend and we could definitely use the help. Cooks just switched their outcome opinion from lean D to to close to call. Thanks all! (Not campaign staff, just a volunteer, trying to do as much as I can! ‚ù§Ô∏è)

They usually have a good list of which organizations and people are supporting or opposing a measure, pllus some articles. For the confusing ones where I feel like it's a "You pressed you, referring to me, that is incorrect. The correct answer is you"  vibe

Content: And, while I'm in here... SO amazing with all the early voting records broken tomorrow. (I continue to be extremely jealous of the NY stickers!) But it's super critical we get that same turnout in swing states. We'd love for folks to join us in <#1242256751445934262> today (if you don't have this, go to <id:customize> and select 'talk to voters in key states') and help us meet our 10 million call goal and get us across the finish line to close strong. (If you can't make it today, we'd SO appreciate it if you could schedule time in the next week to make calls for us.) If you'd like to go straight to the dialer, head [here](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=9ccd3f9e-fa00-4de0-8919-eef3896d1a0d&ref=natl_dis_host_discordveveryoneelse) !

Content: Reposting here for my NYC friends: We had a blast canvassing in PA this weekend! Buses are leaving from NYC, Brooklyn and other places to talk to voters in key states. If you've never done it, I'd 10/10 recommend it. It's fun and it's needed more than ever!

Content: do we have any GOTV buses going to Philly instead of the burbs? If not, is there a contact in Philly if I decide to take a train out there? TIA. I've already done the suburb buses. That is not what I am asking here. TIA.

Content: Oh, my gosh!
I day or so ago I asked about Prop 1. 
I just watched a negative add against it. I don't swear but it made me want to.
It wasn't just stretching the truth, it was an out and out lie about what Prop 1 is. They are hoping people won't bother to find out what it really is and are trying to scare people by saying it has to do with illegal immigrants.  
...just wow. 
It has inspired my Mom and I to go in tomorrow and vote early... For Prop 1, for Kamala Haris and STRAIGHT down the ticket!
