Content: ✨ Welcome to day 2 of the Republican National Convention.✨ 

Hope everyone got to take a few minutes and watch President Biden’s interview with Lester Holt last night:https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/transcript-read-full-biden-interview-lester-holt-nbc-news-rcna162029

Today, our theme is **Trump’s America 2025: Repeal Health Care, Gut Retirement Security**

💠 Today, let your community know Trump wants to repeal health care and gut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid if reelected. 

💠 Key message: 
Under Joe Biden’s leadership, more Americans have health insurance than under any president. He strengthened the Affordable Care Act to lower premiums and expand access to affordable care. He took on Big Pharma and won – lowering prescription drug costs and capping the price of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare. Donald Trump was one vote away from repealing the ACA in his first term and said he will “terminate” the law if reelected. 

Joe Biden is also protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid from extreme MAGA attacks. Donald Trump is proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare while giving tax handouts to his super rich friends. He has also called for privatizing Social Security, which he called a “Ponzi scheme.”
