  content: The text team is doing a great job, I get upwards of 6 a day.  How do I

  content: So you're likely getting donation texts as well. We don't send out those
    donation texts. The only texts we send out is about like upcoming events or volunteer
    recruitment or like voting when it's time to vote. And some others.
