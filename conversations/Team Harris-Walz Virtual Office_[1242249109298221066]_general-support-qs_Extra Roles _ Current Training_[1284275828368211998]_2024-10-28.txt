Content: Is there a way to look into all the training you've completed/are registered for? I would love to get more involved with anything digital, social media, or MODâ€”anything besides phone banking because I have extreme anxiety when it comes to calls. I just completed Vote Team Data Captian training and signed up for a shadow shift but cannot find the shift I signed up for.

I'm getting so confused ðŸ˜‚ I love being here, though! #SecondFamily

Content: Hi <@1067615211432988684> you can see the trainging you signed up for if you have used the same email to sign up for each training. Go to https://events.democrats.org and click the 3-line menu in the upper-right, log in with the email you used when you signed up for trainings, the click the 3-line menu and select "my schedule".
Some teams provide a schedule sheet showing when their volunteers are doing shifts. I don't know if Vote Team does this. You can ask in https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1270925721895698482 if you have access to that channel. If you can't access that channel, you are probably not on-boarded yet and you will get a message with more info once you are on-boarded.
