Content: I am an FB Moderator for Texas. I will also post this same query to that Slack, but I also wanted to ask here.  Several folks have been asking about physical  office locations or names of state level staff for Texas. I am sure that is in the works, but is there a specific area online where that will be updated to democrats.org or texasdemocrats.org?   Thanks.  Jay E

Content: Cool. Almost had the right sub-page. One person did say their purpose was field work. I thought it might be an in kind donation, like where to send a huge amount of water bottles. Thanks again. ðŸ™‚

Content: Just an example, I was trying to think of why they might need an individual name and a physical address. The only thing I could think of was sending a delivery that one might need to sign for.  Hopefully, we will actually get some donations like that. ðŸ™‚
