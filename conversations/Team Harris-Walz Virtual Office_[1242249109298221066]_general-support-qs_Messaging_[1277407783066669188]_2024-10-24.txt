Content: Hi, I want to create what I call ‘101 messaging’ which would just be videos of 30-60 sec bullet points explaining policies .. just basic simple talk on kitchen table and social issues 1) does trickle down economics work? 2) why trump tariffs are inflation 2.0 - simple messaging which really is ‘101’ basic - and then have the short clips blasted throughout insta, messaging etc (after they are approved). Is there a way we can accomplish this please? I recall back in 2012 Obama had an interesting YouTube video explaining why trickle down doesn’t work which was really good and catchy
