  content: 'Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House
    with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from
    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
    MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks
    is crucial.
