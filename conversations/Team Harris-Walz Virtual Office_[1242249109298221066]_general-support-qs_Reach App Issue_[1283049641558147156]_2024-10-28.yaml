  content: Sometimes Reach doesn't work perfectly with every social network. For example,
    it will take me to BlueSky but the image won't populate. In cases like that I
    simply upload the image from my phone to the social network (do a workaround).
    That may be the case with Threads. Thanks for your help sharing this important
    content with your connections. We appreciate it!

  content: Hi Scott, that is the campaign code. Try to swipe away your Reach app,
    or power cycle your device. ANd copy paste the code instead of typing it.
