We cannot include the link though, so I removed that.)  Your original question is below. 

 Elon Musk's Super PAC, America PAC, is offering $47 ($100 in PA) to people each time a voter they refer signs his petition supporting the First and Second Amendment. This is part of an aggressive get-out-the-vote drive he is doing to elect Trump. He also recently started hosting town halls in PA where he spread widely debunked falsehoods about Dominion.

Context aside, I'm wondering how we can specifically counter his PAC given it offers a substantial incentive? One idea I had that I wanted to run by mods was getting folks in this Discord who live in the swing states to sign the petition and then encourage them to donate the money to Kamala's campaign. From my perspective, this is totally legitimate if the signees do support those amendments (which I assume will have broad, if not universal, support for most cases) .  I, for one, completely support the Constitution, and find it beyond puzzling that Elon has this petition to support the candidate who threatened to ""terminate"" it."

I recommend sending that feedback directly to the campaign. Thank you for your thoughtfulness on this issue. https://kamalaharris.com/contact-us/
