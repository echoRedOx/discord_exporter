BUT I never get the verification code e-mail in my comcast inbox (and its not in junk spam either). I am stuck with Discord on comcast e-mail and mobilize on gmail.. which means I will never get the e-mails with training slides"

(If you've enabled ""followup messages"" in Mobilize, then Mobilize would have sent the followup to the same email address that you registered for that event.)"
