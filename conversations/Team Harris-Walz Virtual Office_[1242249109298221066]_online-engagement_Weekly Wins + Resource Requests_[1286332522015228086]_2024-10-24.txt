Content: I shared a map that I received from League of Women Voters. It showed range percentages of women voters in all the states from the last election. High levels: MI, WI PA, GA.  Lowest levels of women voters were in southern states. Lots of boosts and interest.

Content: Hi Gabrielle, I am a Harris-Walz supporter located in Detroit, Michigan. And I belong to the MI Women for Harris-Walz FB group. Over the last month+ there has been a lot of posts by women in “red areas” of the state with fear about posting H-W signs in their yards. So a lot of creative alternatives have been discussed to show support. And women like me in “blue areas” show support, lean an ear and encourage confidence and resolve to support H-W. One of the very creative and brilliant idea that has come out of this group are post-its to encourage women in red areas to vote their heart. Now one innovation woman has had them printed. Ladies have been placing them on stall doors in women’s room.

Content: I work in advertising and I remember that beer advertisers would buy the ability to place signage into restrooms in bars, restaurants, etc. I would suggest if you can see if campaign could make a media buy to place this type of messaging in women’s rooms only in locations across the nation. IJS Thanks Susan “When we Fight WE Win!!” 👊🏽😎🙏🏽
