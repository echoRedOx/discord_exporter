Content: I just replied to the campaign email with the subject line "Please reply to this email" asking for feedback on the campaign, & got an undelivered bounceback that says "the domain contact.kamalaharris.org couldn't be found"  My reply to the email went to     info@contact.kamalaharris.org

Can someone inform the right team that this is happening?

Content: The email I received shows that it was from contact@e.kamalaharris.com. When I replied to it, it shows that it went to     info@contact.kamalaharris.org, which is different from the email address it came from. All I did was hit Reply, so I'm not sure why it defaulted to a different email address, but I imagine this is happening to everyone.

Content: Oh I see. It is likely that the contact@e.kamalaharris.com email can send out emails but the inbox can't receive replies, and the original senders changed the reply-to email so they could see the replies that came in from that feedback request. I hope that helps clear things up!

Content: It did, but the bounceback I got says: "Your message wasn't delivered to info@contact.kamalaharris.org because the domain contact.kamalaharris.org couldn't be found. Check for typos or unnecessary spaces and try again."

Content: something is buggy, because the domain, contact.kamalaharris.org should be recognized, and it's saying that it's not recognized.

Content: I had the same thing happen. Which means it is happening to everyone who was sent this email by the campaign. A correction email might need to be sent out with the correct response email as it effects all supporters, not just volunteers.

Content: (taking off mod hat) Yes, absolutely, they could send out and 'oops, let's try this again email' with the right reply-to address. I know other ways to contact the campaign, but a lot of people may have been annoyed by this.
