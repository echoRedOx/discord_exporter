You'll get added when spaces open. You can also use your text team knowledge with other text banking campaigns like https://events.democrats.org/event/433467/, you can ""text"" in the filter on the https://events.democrats.org/ page."

We have great support for new phone bankers, you will be embraced by wonderful group experience and even if you don't manage to talk to anyone on the phone, you being there will push the numbers up which makes the dialer move faster and others on your team will be able to connect with more folks."
