I'm making good progress pulling folks together with a semblance of a video content plan so can provide an update on Monday.  In the meantime, do you know if there is an existing library of all Harris, Walz, and ideally also Trump, Vance climate and energy related very short video clips that our team of editors/producers could access? If not, is that a project that could make sense for a climate volunteer to work with the broader campaign digital team to create? Seeing how fast they are cranking out other stitched video content (not climate related), I would think there's an existing workflow there that we may leverage... LMK if this is better for email. Thank you!"

“We Can Stand Together”
By Bruce & Michelle Marshall   ©2024
""When some turn a blind eye to justice, and bury their heads in the sand;
We could squander this opportunity don't let it slip through our hands.
Now I'm feeling a sea change upon us, I ask is it pre-ordained?
If we don't take action and face all the facts, we could be forever changed.
CHORUS
We can stand together, Give our future this chance,.
Will we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you stand.
We can stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.
Our Children will carry that mantle if given the chance.
Now some say it's part of a cycle, some say it's part of a scheme;
Some say it's fate now old mother nature is coming apart at the seams.
Now most of us want all the same things, a world without bias and strife.
The same opportunity once and for all is every American's right.
CHORUS
We can stand together, Give our future this chance,.
Will we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you stand.
We can stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.
Our children will carry that mantle if given the chance.
So go blame society, go say your piece and cherish your deep held beliefs.
And all that had mattered got all torn and tattered, history always repeats.
When some turn a blind eye to justice and then quote scripture and verse;
When hypocrisy rules we call out the fools and we all take a turn for the worse.
We can stand together, Give our future this chance; 
Would we welcome a new world just and fair, where do you stand?
We can stand for freedom, for everyone in the land.
Our children will carry that mantle if given the chance.
We can stand together we can strengthen the ties.
We can't let this new found common ground get tossed by the wayside.
We can stand for freedom. We can stand for freedom.""
