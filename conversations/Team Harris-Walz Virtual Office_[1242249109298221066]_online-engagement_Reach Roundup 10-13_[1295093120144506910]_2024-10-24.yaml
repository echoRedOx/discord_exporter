  content: "i've been really engaged with getting \"RepubliCON,\" which is my personal\
    \ word for the tRUMPsters, to get them to choose NOT to Vote for tRUMP, which\
    \ hasn't been easy, but i've been able to pick away at particular downballot candidates\
    \ in their area, as well as tRUMP, due, partly, in fact, to the way i spell his\
    \ name!  \U0001F609"

  content: "I don't know how to explain what I'm doing/have been doing. Maybe something\
    \ similar to Ghost Marketing Strategy?\n\nMy reach is miniscule (for long story\
    \ reasons), but I do have above-average pattern recognition and can combine this\
    \ with professional experience growing audiences. I watch. I do a vibe check.\
    \ Then drop in with an insight or add one with/to approved content to maximize\
    \ my impact.\n\nSorta kinda how I mod? \U0001F605 \n\nSo it isn't any one thing.\
    \ It is at the intersections of many where I quietly boost, amplify, and/or push\
    \ back against what I am noticing in the gaps."

  content: Many voters I spoke with did not want to tell me who they were voting for,
    mostly women, but there was no good option to enter that. I usally entered "other"
    but it then made the conversation disjointed, because I couln'dt really go on
    to a good script. I accepted their privacy without hestitation, and jumped to
    asking if they needed help with polling locations, etc. It would be useful to
    have an option to input, "unwilling to disclose." I suspect they were Kamala voters
    because they almost always stuck with the call.
