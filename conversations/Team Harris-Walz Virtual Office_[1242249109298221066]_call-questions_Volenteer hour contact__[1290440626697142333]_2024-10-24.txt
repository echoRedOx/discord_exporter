Content: Hi guys! Long time ~~listener~~ reader, first time caller (hehe get it), so im a current high school student that wants to help out calling/texting or really anyway possible. My school has a requirement to get a certain amount of hours to graduate and further awards if you go above and beyond for community service. I have clarified with school admin that political campaigns are fine to claim as I am working for a local canidate #cass4tx for a bunch of hours already and want to know if I can get hours from this? also in our portal we need to put in a contact person to make sure I actually did the work and that contact details are in the form of a phone number or email for verification. If I am allowed to claim hours whom should I put down and what details should I put in? Thanks Yall

Content: <@1263159708466811000> This high schooler wants to volunteer but would need a contact email who could confirm the number of hours he put in, is this possible?

Content: Hey <@669675021161070603> - we have done this for student volunteers. I would say to just keep track of your shifts (either phone banking or texting) and when you are ready, reach back out to us. We can identify someone who can sign off for you and set up for you to DM the form to them. Easy peasy! 

Do you know how to sign up for shifts?

Content: Once you've gone through a phone bank shift and feel comfortable, we have anytime calling, so you can jump in and just call when you have time. But I would suggest starting with a Zoom phone bank so you have support people there to answer questions and make sure you're comfortable with it.
