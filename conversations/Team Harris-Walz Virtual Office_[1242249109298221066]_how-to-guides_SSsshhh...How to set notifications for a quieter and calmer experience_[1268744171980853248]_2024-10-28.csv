To change notifications, right click (laptop) or tap and hold (mobile/tablet) the Category name. Click or tap ""Mute Category"" and select your preferred option. For maximum quiet, select ""Until I turn it back on"" or select your preferred option.

Next, click or tap ""Notification Settings"". You can turn all notifications OFF by clicking or tapping ""Nothing"".  If you select @ mentions you will still receive push notifications when you or your roles are mentioned/tagged. 

You now have your preferred notifications set for all channels in the category and you've muted the category. 

These settings can help manage overwhelm. 

You can also right click or press and hold a category, then select ""Mark as Read"" to dismiss bold channels that show up when new messages are present. If you're still seeing channels in bold, you can quiet them by muting the category or the specific channel. 

Let us know if you have questions on these features!"
