Content: I'm hosting an event in New Orleans on August 11. How do I get it listed on the dem event map? The area around NOLA is much in need of events, as the attached map attests. 

Here is our event on Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/1111philo/events/302421831/

And here is our Eventbrite link: https://www.eventbrite.com/o/1111-philosophers-group-88940917613

Content: Hi, I am one of the organizers of Dads for Kamala and we are planning both in person phone banks and virtual phone banks. Would love to fold into the campaign infrastructure if someone could help with this?

We also have a number of house parties that are meant to drive commitments and donations. We built a toolkit for this, but would be great to align with any tools the campaign already has. Thanks!

Content: I could use some help getting permission to use the Mobilize site to host more than phone banks and DNC watch parties.  I have two events on August 13 and 15 where I will invite around 200 folks to join into relational organizing events and would like to use the Mobilize system.  I would welcome help from anyone who may be able to assist in getting the Mobilize capability in place.

Content: I've filled out the host form, but it's limited to just phone bank and watch party. I also signed up for the Sept 12th Grassroots organization meeting, and I'll start working through the workbook.

I'm hoping to get some support for organizing materials for a local event that could be easily reproduced across the country. Is there a mentor or liaison?

Content: Hi all- I am looking for guidance on how to comply with FEC rules if we’re auctioning donated items as a Harris fundraiser. Do we need to report those donated items and if so how? Will this be in the upcoming toolkit?

Content: Sorry <@1269425103117090848>, I don't know the answer.  But I'd assume that approval should be faster, if you submitted a Mobilize event template (not Google Form).

Content: No, the Watch Party toolkit doesn't cover donations.  But you can ask info@kamalaharris.com for the appropriate contact.  (ActBlue processes the campaign's online donations, and ActBlue's email is info@actblue.com.)  Questions about donating to the party can be directed to https://democrats.org/contact-us/

Content: OK. Thanks guys.  It’s more complicated than make a $20 donation on actblue which is why I need to talk to a live person. I will email info@kamalaharris.com to see whether someone can help. My cell phone number is in my profile and if you want to call, please text me first.

Content: <@1242248892804763712>  Ok re-posting from another channel: I am hosting a DNC watch party and at least 1 attendee who is registered needs to be removed and blocked (offensive name and email). 

This is an official DNC event and the person registered through Mobilize.

Does anyone here know how I can remove, delete, and/or block attendees  or who I should contact to find out how to do so?

Content: not a mod, but the only thing i can see to do with it, would be to cancel them. That way they dont get invites or notification to the watch party. But i dont think theres a way to block. Ive been looking.

Content: The name was so egregiously offensive that I want to ban them too. I have my Zoom set so folks have to register to get the link AFTER they've registered thru Mobilize but I want to remove that person before they even get to my Zoom.

Content: I've been really liking streamin it on twitch because of how good their bots are for trolls and theres some requirements to chat in the chat. Like for me, I have a ten minute follow time before you can say anything. Which strongly discourages trolls. I can barely remember my thought two minutes ago let alone ten lolol. I dont know too much about zoom, are there any bots for it that might help with issues like that?

Content: Hello.  I am volunteering on the email inbox team.  I have a question from a supporter who is asking this question: "Can I make the event private for now and change setting to public later?"  I was thinking to respond with "Please attend a training session to ask this question."  But is there an official answer or FAQ?

Content: Hi - One of our recent volunteers is interested in the convention preview event on Sat Aug 17 on the Stage.  I thought I saw a function where I could invite someone to the virtual office, but don't see it anymore.  She is techy and already on Discord.  Can anyone give me directions?  Note that we will need to help our other chapter members to get access as soon as we talk them into it😀

Content: hey! sorry to bug yall, but i just noticed my watch party for the DNC was set to private, and its been public the entire time ive had it up. Is there a way to see a like "user log" or way to see when it might have been changed? I'm also trying to add another event for the 18th of september but its only letting me set one for the 22nd of August. ^-^ open to suggestions ❤️
also  i have over 2K now signed up for my watch parties, will i hear back from anyone regarding being ghosted by the DNC after reaching out to help? Like i was streaming this on my own for my job as a content creator, only went to the website to volunteer my time, effort, and audience to help. It's been nothing but stress since i reached out and frankly im so dishearted that i dont even want to host it anymore.

Content: gotcha, i was trying to add it all the the same event due to the number of emails the website sends out to everyone. I have the election date and the 9/10 debate on there. Is there like a limit to event days/times on a specific event? I was able to switch it back to public and when i exited the page and went back, it was private again. I was wondering why my sign ups slowed down lol.

Content: Hi there!! 

My first time posting in this group, I’m not sure if this is the appropriate place to post, please delete if not the appropriate location. 🙏🏾✨

I’m looking to host a fundraising event, in Los Angeles, and I was wondering if there are any future training sessions on what we should know, before launching said events in the community? 

Basically I’m hoping to throw an all day karaoke event, at a local restaurant that is new to the Mid-city area. 

If anyone is in the area and would like to help, please hit me up! 

Cheers!

Content: First time here, and looking for advice. In September, I’m hosting a private house party with postcard writing and live music. I have the invite set up in Evite and would like to include a URL where people can donate $50 per person to the Harris campaign as their ticket price. Would be ideal to track how much I raise through the ticket sales. Something similar to the pages people can create for Pan Mass challenge or Boston marathon etc fundraising. Does anyone know where and how to set up a personalized fundraising page?

Content: I dont know any, im not an expert, just think you have a great idea. I think if you set yourself an attendance goal say 10 people. You can say Im hosting a watch party and fundraiser. Join me in donating $50 to add link. Lets raise $500 for Kamala and celebrate by watching the debate together.

Content: The staff would be the best to answer this question. In the meantime I want to acknowledge that I agree with you. I want to host an event too but felt overwhelmed quickly by the process. The mods and staff come around and answer questions periodically. I have been doing getting in touch with some folks who i havent talked in a while, but I miss them. Just checking on them to see how they are doing/how they are feeling about it all so I know who is going to be all in with me and who we can convince to campaign with us. When I was campaigning for Bernie I really didnt know what to do after I hosted the event, mostly because everyone that came was not sure what they wanted to do. So think about what it is that makes you miss these folks and open your conversations honestly. I have not felt this alive in a while. I'm saying that to my friends and my family. Also knowing that not everyone is goign to be able to campaign, but maybe they can donate or should come to your watch party is you share the link to your event on your social media or text it to your friends. In my initial reach out to folks I added an invitation to this group. To some I said in case you want to get involved or I see what you are doing and we need you here too.

Content: are you asking about this in the context of wanting to run your own phone banks or about our phone bank events specifically? if its the latter, you do not need your own zoom phone bank link because you will be joining our link--you will need to sign into a zoom account to access our meeting though

Content: I was asking about hosting our own event like a phone bank do we create our own zoom links or will we be sent one to use. Because if we create our own link it has a 40 minute time limit or upgrade and pay and usually the phone banks last longer than that

Content: Yes! You can use ActBlue to set up a personalized fundraising link.  You create a fundraising form (under Fundraising you click "create a form") and it allows you to create a personalized URL and QR code for your fundraiser. If you'd like any other help, please just let us know and thank you for hosting an event! Let's win this!

Content: Hi <@1279971486316105738> There are lots of groups that have scripts and addresses but most of those just send you the info and the individuals provide the post cards, stamps, and people power. I have done this with Activate America but it doesn't look like they have any campaigns focused on TX races right now. 
I would recommend looking in <#1268426751164551199> and <#1268378299428634727>  to see what opportunities are posted there and possibly contacting the organizers.

Content: I have someone who has signed up to both my watch parties with an egregiously offensive name. How do I remove them? Last time I just manually cancelled their registration and the slots all filled up. And they're using different email addresses - probably fake too.

Content: Hey <@1250880260338094331> Sarah Jane - thanks for checking. I'll send a screenshot tomorrow morning when I'm on my PC. The first name is a racial slur. I did set their status to Cancelled like I did for my first watch party.

Content: People stayed muted and as host (and the co-hosts too) we can mute them if need be. That said, folks wanted to watch the DNC and only chatted during breaks or interludes. They were incredibly courteous and thoughtful. We as hosts hardly had to do a thing. (I know from experience that is not always the case) There were indeed times when folks wanted to chat but they kept it to a minimum.

Content: I'm also doing a virtual watch party, and my plan was to mute everyone during the debate but keep the chat going, with time before and after for discussion and a presentation I'm going to give. If anyone wants a livestream link that is live now, I'm planning to use this one which will include closed captions and real-time ASL interpretation: https://dpan.tv/videos/presidential-debates/

Content: Hi folks, I am hosting an in-person phone bank right now. We spent the last hour and half on the NC undecided voters list. There were a lot of hangups and the people we did engage with were all strong Trump leaning. Are we sure the target cohort was undecided voters? 

Also the volunteers are a bit down after their experience so far. Any tips on keeping them motivated so they will be willing to do this again?

Content: <@923456786504253470> that is the way of it with some of these swing state lists. I always remind callers that every contact helps the campaign because they are either helping us cull the list to remove MAGA voters so we can focus our final push efforts on mobilizing undecided and Harris voters or they are helping us to bring more Harris supporters into our volunteer ranks.

Content: I did not find any affiliated local letter writing orgs with listed events on Mobilize, but I think the teens who are working or will be looking for work soon would benefit from a labor rights awareness. Thus, we have a local candidate for State Labor Board who has listed an event. You can coordinate with them locally. https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/694575/ and Labor Neighbor WA AFL CIO https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/697644/.

Content: How can I get a Harris/Walz-likely voter list of names/addresses for a postcard party? I already have the "Vote" postcards from the Civics Center, but the list they sent me is non-partisan.  The postcard text is aimed at encouraging the youth vote and a reminder that new voters must register early.

Content: Hi there (not on duty, just popped in) - if you're logged into your Mobilize acct, you should be able to access your Dashboard to see the event registrants. I typically will export to Excel so I can then easily copy emails and paste into my [to] or [bcc] box to send them info.

Content: Hi <@1268699351551705222> (not on duty, just popped in for the moment): In my experience, this was not easy to accomplish. My local independent team had to reach out to personal contacts in battleground states to get Harris-supporter targeted lists, which took time and buy-in from those state contacts. You might try asking in your state channel. (EG- I'm in TX so it'd be [# Texas] (without the space in between).

Content: Thank you! This one says "phone bank" on the image, however. Is there one that has just a generic image without an event name in it?

Content: Maybe "GOTV for KAMALA" or something generic for a GOTV party if we're unable to use something custom for our event. I just would really like to get everything connected to the campaign vs using Eventbrite or something for RSVPs.

Content: I hear you. If someone from staff can help who might have the ability to make these changes, that could work. This may also just be something out of our reach right now. You can consider what you'd like the title or description to be that could help align things better for you

Content: I completely understand. My working title is "OC for Pete GOTV Party" and the description will include the purpose to reunite Team Pete volunteers from Orange County to help GOTV for Kamala and the local down ballot Dems. We have several tight races here who can use all the support they can get.

Content: <@1250880260338094331>: Do you still want us to host birthday parties for the Vice President? Mine is still awaiting an approval in Mobilize so I haven't invited anyone yet. Also, I have a new event in there tied to the Out for Harris Walz push that I emailed you about the other day. That one is is called:  Marylanders for Harris-Walz Pasadena Parade Entry. Thanks for all that you do to make this campaign a success!

Content: The most reliable way to get audio is to use computer for dialer and phone for audio. Sorry I did not see this earlier, but that's the first line solution for when you do another.

Content: Hello! Quick question - I'm doing a virtual House Party on Saturday that is public. Someone signed up with a fake name that is a slur word, so I moved their status to "Cancelled" - is that sufficient to remove them from the party? I saw a couple of other people talking about managing this kind of thing a while back but I couldn't seem to find the thread. Thanks so much!

Content: Am hosting a phonebank live at my home on Sunday.  Qs:  Do you have an FAQ for in-person phonebanks?  WIll people be using their portable devices + phone at in-person events also?  And, because it's at a home, should people bring headphones (and for device?  or their phone) since the space is not huge?

Content: We just have the one FAQ geared to virtual PBs mostly (on the Host Guide PDF). Yes, they'll be using their laptop/tablet + phone for audio at in person events so yes, headphones/earbuds are ideal and highly recommended in this setting. 🙂

Content: Hi there KBR! We are working on custom dialer links that will allow some level of specific phonebank calls made and will have that out soon! I don't think it will be retroactive, but if you use the custom dialer link, it will track the calls made by your actual event in future phonebanks! We will send that out when it's ready. 🙂

Content: oh sweet!  Thx.  not sure what the "custom dialer link" is, however.  If you can drop me a link or screenshot of what that looks like, that would be helpful.

Content: It will be just like the current dialer link but your own custom link to it so that the dialer ties the calls being made directly to your event only and we can track those. Very cool! Looks just like the regular dialer link but with some extra characters with name of your event that tie it to your event.

Content: It works immediately! Once you type your event name on that 2nd tab, just copy the link it it makes to the right and use that as your custom dialer link at all your events from now on. Then check back later on tab 3 for the results!
