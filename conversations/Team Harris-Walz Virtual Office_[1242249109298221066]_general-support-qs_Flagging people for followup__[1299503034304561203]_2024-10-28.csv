I was assuming I didn't need to be in the Zoom, having been to one training.   Tabbing between the apps isn't too bad, but if I try to wait for responses on Zoom, it is going to make the call recipient's  experience VERY disjointed. I was hoping for a way to get them a followup call with more detailed assistance.  There's no way to do that, then?"

You can certainly do this on your own and the best path to get support would be https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1263529508300914809"

One other thing ... is there a way I can unlock the ""followup"" textbox that sends voting info, so that I can customize the text in response to questions?   Example: I just had a fervent supporter ask where to find genuine (not bootlegged) T-shirts, and it would have been great to be able to C+P the URL into the text in the app."

There is a section on the debrief form where you can note specific issues. These are reviewed by staff.

I got someone yesterday who was leaning Trump who was very unsure and I didn’t feel like I convince him, but I felt like someone else might be able to. We had to end the conversation because he was going to Whole Foods and it just pulled up in his car. But he had his three-year-old daughter in the car and I felt like he’d be open to some persuasion.
