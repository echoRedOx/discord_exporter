  content: Hi, I lost wifi briefly with one caller who was interested in volunteering
    in a future week. I only remember their first name and when I reopened the dialer,
    they were no longer there. Is it possible for one of the calls teams organizers
    to give them a call or text back?

    the survey, hopefully it will put her back into the queue

  content: Thank you so much Jen! I actually just exited the dialer a minute ago and
    submitted the form, but thank you for your kind words. I had a really positive
    experience tonight with a lot of people saying they'd vote for her if they couldn't
    volunteer, and I will definitely join more sessions in the upcoming days!
