  content: Just signed up with Harris Walz discord today. I want to do text banking.
    How do I get trained in the texting platform? How do I join the Harris Walz national
    texting team and start texting? Thanks.

  content: So the only channel would be <#1266829704204386334> as all the other text
    channels are private. And you have to go through training before we text. And
    we don't send out notices.

  content: "OK. I will check the DNC site link you sent periodically. Can you please\
    \ pass on a message to whoever is in charge of scheduling the text trainings and\
    \ the texting program in general? I am aware that this greatly compressed timeframe\
    \ for the Harris Walz campaign is like building an airplane while you\u2019re\
    \ flying it, but the digital campaign has GOT to schedule more and frequent text\
    \ platform trainings ASAP so we can get more people texting now. Me, for example,\
    \ I\u2019m ready to start texting now but I\u2019ll have to wait. I LOVED doing\
    \ national texting with the Biden Harris 2020 campaign. I want to do the same\
    \ for Harris Walz 2024. I\u2019m sure there are many others in my position, too.\
    \ Got to find a way to turn all this potential campaign volunteer energy into\
    \ work. We\u2019ve got less than 3 months to win this thing. Thanks."

  content: "Jeannine and/or Jack: thanks for responding. I will check these out. Based\
    \ on past volunteer work, I\u2019ve found that texting is better than phone banking.\
    \ (For starters, many people just don\u2019t pick up calls from unknown numbers.\
    \ I don\u2019t.) For the text banking, am I correct that my next steps are to\
    \ watch the DNC site for future trainings, do the training, then I will get an\
    \ invitation from the text team moderators and given access to the daily batches\
    \ of text assignments to sign up for? This was more or less the process with Slack\
    \ and Through Text in 2020. Thanks and have a good day."

  content: Came here with the same question (even though I've already texted here
    in past year elections, including the Kansas abortion amendment). Oh well. David,
    the Gavin Newsome PAC has been texting nationally to swing states since before
    Harris became the new nominee and they're very well-organized and the training
    is easy and on You Tube. Maybe try that for now? https://campaignfordemocracy.com/text/?source=em240709-1
