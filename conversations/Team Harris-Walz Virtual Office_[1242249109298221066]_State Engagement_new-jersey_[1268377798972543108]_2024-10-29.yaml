    State Building) and seeing lots of good ads for Kamala Harris: putting her face
    on during the Olympics, introducing her and the issues.  What amazes me is that
    the ads are being broadcast to NY/NJ/CT, which are surely ''blue'' states.  Are
    there TV ads going out to swing states too?  If so, great.  I think it shows the
    resources the campaign has, and seeing them during the Olympics is perfect timing.'

    Kim joining Bob Casey in the Senate (also Fetterman since I worked on his campagin
    in 2022), and I want to see the district I live in now go blue!

  content: hey! atlantic county here. I had a MASSIVE issue last night with the LGBTQIA+
    liaison for atlantic county. I reached out to them to volunteer and use my platform
    to get canadites infront of the online space (twitch streamer) and the first conversation
    with everyone went great. Then the liaison jumped in and was just absolutely unresponsive
    to the suggestions and explaintions I was giving about attracting more members.
    It ended with her telling me I was making fun of her and her "boomer" (her wods
    not mine) friends and that I dont care about the same things she does and I need
    to stop judging her. When the last email i sent was about how much i care about
    getting regulations into nursing homes and end of life care facilies. How much
    I talk about Alzhiemers and the funding for it. So i just feel really insulted
    and Bob was in the convo (chair down here) and he hasnt said anything and neither
    has anyone else so im kinda just assming that the DNC wants nothing to do with
    me

  content: hey so i currently have over 1K for my watch party monday night, and more
    as the day goes on, and I've been trying to get ahold of my local democratic party
    but after talking with the lgbtqia+ causcus liaison to south jersey, i was belittled
    and demeaned in a way that i no longer wanted to be part of the lgbtqia+ causcus.
    No one else from the party has contacted me, regardless of emails, phone calls,
    text, or comments in the NJ channel. I really feel like im being ghosted by my
    party and I'm just trying to get nj canidates infront of my audience. any suggestions?

    talk to my audience about how to get involved at a local level, the different
    types of caucuses, how to set those up, the importance of primiaries. Plus like
    the canidates policies, why we should vote for them, things like that. Just a
    regular interview and hangout session  where people can get to know and trust
    people. Or i wanted to stream the grand opening of a new HQ but thats tomorrow
    and I still havent heard anything

    I also wanted to interview the super delegate because i have no idea how that
    process works, and if i dont my followers sure dont, so i want those processes
    explained

    and i did connect with the LGBTQ+ liaison but after explaining why i was reaching
    out and how i can help, she told me people only wanted a social club and until
    the youth show up we have no idea what they can offer. So i really didnt want
    to contune talking to someone that thought so little of younger voters. They also
    then told me I was judging them, making fun of them, and said it was because shes
    a "boomer" her words not mine. I can upload the emails but i just dont know what
    to do anymore'

    like commisioners at large and local school boards?

    and they wanted me to stream the opening of the HQ, in person, and meet the super
    delegate there, in person.

    a decent amount of my community is NJ local, or texas for some reason lol. but
    they never mentioned i would need creditials to do anything local

    to be fair they didnt really mention anything other than how they cant get people
    to join the caucus and then telling me i was judging them.

    also, this isnt a judgement on anyone, but like, i wish i knew about these things
    before now. I only found out about the discord because someone on tumblr mentioned
    it because i talked about my problem on there. The liaison even expressed that
    we dont probably vote for the same reasons as she''s a senior citizen. And i did
    express that I talk about better nursing home and end of life care facility regulations.
    More funding and science for Alzhiemers. Reducing the deffense budget to help
    veterans. these are things i activily use my platform for and to be told I dont
    care about the same things as her was just frankly insulting. She mentioned that
    they would like me to help get more volunteers to join, but then started talking
    about how no one wants to show up because its not a social club or a bar. I recommened
    that maybe a gay night at a local club hosted by the caucus might be a really
    good idea. Especially if the canidate was there. Like in parks and rec. people
    love that level of connection.'

    a majority of my life, so i watch and heard about a lot of people dying while
    i sat there and did my home work either at the house with the patient or home.
    The elderly is something i VERY MUCH care about, because im very aware i will
    end up there with most likely a diagonoses for alzheimers. so it was just a massive
    slap in the face to hear her say i dont care.

    I called, ive texted, i reached back out to the original person, i honestly dont
    know how much more energy i can dump into this. I'm just trying to volunteer my
    platform, and this is just really rubbing me so wrong, and exhausting. Its been

    in jersey and does like spray paint murals or stuff like that.  I have a wall
    outside my house (its mine, it supports the hill behind it lol) and I''m 200 yards

    get a qoute and stuff on that. Any suggestions?'

  content: "<@391802910217863168>  I'll repeat something my sister warned me about\
    \ years ago now. She lives overseas, but always kept in touch with local (Bergen\
    \ County) issues. She related to me how she watched the local Republicans repeatedly\
    \ use a 'playbook', so to speak -- i.e. the precise same thing as Gov. Walz describes\
    \ in his  video about Project 2025 -- it is indeed a playbook. Just at a local,\
    \ not national scale.\n\nMy sister said to me that she witnessed multiple local\
    \ Republicans all repeat the precise same talking points on various local issues,\
    \ on multiple occasions, in order to dominate the discussion. Republicans seem\
    \ (?) better at this type of coordination.\n\nIt is only logical once thought\
    \ over - of course local playbooks have been created all over the map, by both\
    \ 'sides' (understand that I am a fierce Independent; we tend to field our own\
    \ small teams \U0001FAE0 Not this time though... \U0001F610)\n\nI have also only\
    \ recently returned to NJ, having spent years in the wilds of Pennsylvania, surrounded\
    \ by Trump supporters. By virtue of my precarious balance in the middle, and by\
    \ evil happenstance, most of my friends are now ex or, at best, friends at an\
    \ extreme distance. I have personally witnessed the most unbelievable issues (!)\
    \ be brought forth as a 'reasonable' topic for conversation. Over and over and\
    \ over again. Ad nauseum, until the friendships would dissolve into a gooey cult\
    \ 'ghoulash soup'. (sic)\n\nWhat I mean to say by all this is that they have a\
    \ weapon in their 'arsenal' that we cannot really match. You might imagine that\
    \ I say that with distress, when in actuality I say it with a concerned form of\
    \ relief. Because it is the Republican base's willingness to embrace insanity,\
    \ in order to 'win'.\n\nIn my view confronting the insanity directly is completely\
    \ pointless-- they will simply sidestep the issue even in their own minds. Our\
    \ father was a psychologist until he switched to mathematics. He would have had\
    \ a field day studying all this. :/"

  content: I agree wholeheartedly.  I think that the Democrats could counter that
    with a civics lottery styled in the same fashion -- but use his wealth against
    him by pointedly helping the winners (who could win, say, a spot at a rally) pick
    a suitable *charity*  I hate the idea that all of this illicit cash can effectively
    buy states. It is grotesque.

    says. It could be a wrong number, the person you are looking for might not be
    available (busy/call back) or it could be that the person who answers can hand
    the phone to the person you are looking for.

  content: Hi <@1270895729610723413> - we LOVE hearing about early voting lines, but
    unfortunately, there are some states that don't allow photos within 75 feet of
    a polling place, so we have to remove the photos. Sorry about that!
