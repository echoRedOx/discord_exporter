Content: Hi <@666870822836895745> the event you signed up for should provide the next steps, some are very last-minute and you may only hear on the day of the event. Something like this
"*Each volunteer will be given a list of 45 to 60 doors to do for the day on their own. We just ask you to pick up the literature/voter guide and turf at the designated time. PLEASE NOTE: AT THIS LOCATION YOU MUST SIGN UP BY 7 PM THE NIGHT BEFORE."*
