Content: It would be great to be able to indicate that someone has already voted- they're not "strong" or "leaning" it's DONE. I've gotten a lot of PA voters tonight who said they already sent in their ballots.

Content: Erin just told us that the call lists are updated as information is received and people who have voted are removed.  So, there will be a lag, but those folks will be removed from the lists.
