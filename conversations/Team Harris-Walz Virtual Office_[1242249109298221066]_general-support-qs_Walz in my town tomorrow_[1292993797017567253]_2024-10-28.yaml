  content: A group of us would like to be out with support signs for Walz coming through
    Sacramento CA tomorrow.  How do I find out the best location to be along the road
    or outside meeting location?  We have Harris/Walz signs.  I do not believe he
    is doing a public event though.

  content: Hi <@1292928944776937506> - the campaign keeps all of that information
    pretty locked down for security purposes. If there is no public event, it is difficult
    to know where he will be. You might post in the <#1268356016240857088> channel
    to see if any other volunteers are organizing around the visit.
