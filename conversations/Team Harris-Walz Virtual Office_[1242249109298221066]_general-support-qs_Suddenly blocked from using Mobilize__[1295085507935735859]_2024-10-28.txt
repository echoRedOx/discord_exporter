Content: I was signing up for a text bank and I suddenly am getting blocked from using Mobilize. I was clicking the link from Instagram so I don't know if that made it seem suspicious? But now I can't access it on my phone or computer so I feel like it is my IP being blocked. It says to email the owner but there is no email.

Content: I'm hearing it may be working again. Also, some users have found Firefox to work if you use Chrome. Thanks for your patience!

Content: <@568257600228032512> and I verified a workaround for the Mobilize issue.  Use Mozilla Firefox to access Mobilize US.  When you get the Magic Link, paste the long link into Firefox URL address bar.  That should work.  Thanks, Jay E
