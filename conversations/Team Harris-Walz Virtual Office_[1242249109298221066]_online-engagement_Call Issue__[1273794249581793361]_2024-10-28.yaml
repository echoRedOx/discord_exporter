  content: "I just saw your response. Thank you for reaching out to me. \U0001F60A\
    \ I was in the Women for Harris-Waltz Pre-Convention Call. It was scheduled for\
    \ 8pm but I was still waiting for it to load. Both the YouTube live stream link\
    \ and the Zoom call were delayed and once they loaded it was five-ten minutes\
    \ until I had sound.\n\nIs there another Party Host Information Session coming\
    \ up? I missed the one last night but I'd like to host a watch party."
