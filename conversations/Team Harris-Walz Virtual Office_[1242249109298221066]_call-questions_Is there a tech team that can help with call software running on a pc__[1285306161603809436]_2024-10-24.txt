Content: It likes to buffer then freeze once I connect. It’s not my WiFi because that’s fast and fiber. Both are Mac/iOS and updated. I’ve tried in both safari and Firefox and the call software always craps out on the Mac. On a good day I might get a few calls to work on the pc but the software fail always kicks in eventually. 

I know they like us using a phone *and* laptop, but given my left arm is prosthetic (looks cool like a terminator, but much less dexterous) one device is better. My phone handles the call software just fine but trying to talk there and push buttons on the pc is rough.

Content: Hi Kai, sorry you're dealing with these issues and thank you for still pushing through to help! In your next session, please ask a tech captain and I'm certain they'll be able to help out in a breakout room. Just explain the why as our default is to suggest the 2 devices for simplicity sake but I hope we're able to help you find a way to do it easily with just the 1 device!
