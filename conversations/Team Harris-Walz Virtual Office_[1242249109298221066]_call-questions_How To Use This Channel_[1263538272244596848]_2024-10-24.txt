Content: Hi Frances! I'm new to the Discord platform, so am hoping this is the right spot for my question. I have completed facilitator training and shadowing on 8/31. I am eager to do the last step and get started. I can Facilitate and/or Chat Captain. I have done it on another campaign. I have flexible time. I spoke (after the shadow experience) and emailed with Malcolm last week. If I can help in any other way, let me know. I have signed up to phonebank 4-6p ET on 8/7. If you answer here, I hope I can find it again! LOLðŸ¤£

Content: Hi--Malcolm should be following up with you for next steps, which I believe is to do a co-facilitation shift? Please keep an eye out for his email, and if you dont hear from him, let me know and I will talk to him.
