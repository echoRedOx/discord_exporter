Content: Sometimes Reach doesn't work perfectly with every social network. For example, it will take me to BlueSky but the image won't populate. In cases like that I simply upload the image from my phone to the social network (do a workaround). That may be the case with Threads. Thanks for your help sharing this important content with your connections. We appreciate it!

Content: I thought you had fixed it. It started working with Threads last night.  Just in time for the debate. <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Content: Sounds like it glitched. Seems like everything gets glitchy these days from Discord to Reach to my phone. ðŸ˜‚ Glad it's working now!

Content: Is there a campaign code

Elsewhere on this server it was listed as ZUMT5Q but that's not working.

Content: It shouldn't have changed. Maybe try deleting your cache and refreshing to try again?

Content: Hi Scott, that is the campaign code. Try to swipe away your Reach app, or power cycle your device. ANd copy paste the code instead of typing it.
