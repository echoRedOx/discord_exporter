Content: Greetings: 

My name is Bradley J Bozant. I am a bully and two-time cancer survivor.

I wrote a legislative bill called The Student Protections Act. The bill grants all students Federal Protection from Bullying, Cyber-Bullying, Harassment, and Hazings.

Federal Protection Statutes are granted to Individuals who has a learning disability, mental disability, physical disability, and has medical conditions under Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act (IDEA).

Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy, Louisiana Congressman Troy Carter, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez; New Jersey Senator Cory Booker,  Texas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, and California Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici had the bill under review.

Student Protections Act will be presented before the Congressional Educational Workforce Committee waiting for a response on date it will be up for discussion.

I am requesting VP Harris and Gov Walz support the bill.

Content: Hi there Brad!  This server is for volunteers for the Kamala Harris campaign to organize.  The best way to ensure campaign officials see your request is to directly reach out and contact them using this form at this link: https://democrats.org/contact-us/ .  I'm sorry to send you yet to another place to try and get an answer, but this is the BEST way to get your message *directly* to the campaign staff.
