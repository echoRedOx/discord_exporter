  content: "I am reaching out to Vote411.org (and Ballotpedia) they say I should reach\
    \ out to the candidates.  \n\nI tried filling out a form for the Harris campaign\
    \ but it is not letting me submit - says it looks like spam.  \n\nPLEASE - this\
    \ would be a serious MISSED OPPORTUNITY to communicate with voters.    i know\
    \ people who use these tools as their source of info (esp local races) and they\
    \ say it influences their vote if the candidate didn't answer the questions. \
    \  (thankfully Trump didn't answer either.  in PA senate race - Casey answered,\
    \ McCormick didn't..... \n\nCan someone get a message to the campaign to look\
    \ into it?   I've reached out to Vote411 as well."

  content: I would try the form again and submit it. I agree - that's where many voters
    go for info. And it would influence mine if a candidate hadn't answered
