Content: That's cool to hear. I live in a rural town now but not for most of my life, so I don't think I fully get it. Not raised in a small town.

Content: Welcome to rural town life! It's just nice to not feel overlooked. And I'm sure there's lots of folks in many demographics that hopefully are feeling seen with Harris-Walz. I know I am on many levels.
