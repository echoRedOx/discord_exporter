  content: Hi Vera! <@368807878926008341> and I started looking into this - she's
    UWS and I'm midtown east. We were looking around Columbus Circle and reached out
    to McGee's (W55 and Broadway) - there's a cover of $500 and a max of 70 people.
    Was going to see if we can find a place where we can host for free. If you have
    any ideas, let us know!

  content: Columbus Circle works for me. My husband would join as well. $500 is not
    too bad if we get 50-70ppl.
