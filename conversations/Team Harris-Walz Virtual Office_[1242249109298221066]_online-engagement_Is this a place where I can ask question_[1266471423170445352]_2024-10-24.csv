This sounds like someone who is undecided  and those are really the people we need to connect with! I think it is important to note that while the VP doesn't sign laws like the POTUS, their job is just as important. If this voter likes what Biden has done, then I was would say ""The VP, by rules in the consitution, cannot sign laws like the President. But as Vice President, Harris has made history and supported the laws that Biden put in place. If she were to be president, these things would continue under her administration!"""

What about meeting over 100 world leaders from across the world to improve our reputation abroad? Passing tie-breaking after tie-breaking vote to deliver the Inflation Reduction Act, several judges and federal department members, etc... Most tie-breaking votes cast by a VP in history, if I remember correctly. In March, she was the first President/VP to go to a Planned Parenthood abortion center to better understand the process and how people are treated. She's taken the lead on abortion messaging for the Admin since Dobbs, too, so there's that to consider"
