Content: I'm a premium Linkedin user ($30/month) . This plan unlocks a number of useful benefits like featured application statuses, InMail functionality, and of course the social network's AI features (actually seeing who has opened your post and providing analytics).  This has been extremely useful relative to making direct contact with friends in my network and encouraging them to engage the Kamala/Tim campaign (while also allowing me to touch base with friends I haven't checked in with for years).   I'm using messaging to continue existing conversation threads.

Who's using Linkedin and do you have other thoughts about its effective use in relational organizing in the digital sphere?
