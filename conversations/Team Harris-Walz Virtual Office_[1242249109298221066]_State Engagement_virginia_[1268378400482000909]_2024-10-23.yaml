  content: Hey everybody.  I'm kind of intermittent at the moment as I recovering
    from a long illness.  I am an online engagement team member. I am very interested
    in disinformation, trolling and malign information campaigns, especially on Twitter.   I
    am a social scientist who has been studying malign information and social behavior
    for a couple of decades.  The problem of what to do about those campaigns is currently
    very much an "art" as much as a science.  I should be around more now. My plan
    is to work mostly on weekends and occasional evenings after word.

  content: Hi Hi! Hi! My friend's mom is working with https://www.vopropros.com/ -
    they reach out to people who have voted Dem in the past but are inactive. She
    is doing a lot of work in Pennsylvania because there are some senate seats that
    are flippable. Like https://www.ehaszforcongress.com/. There are several races
    in NC that are also flippable, my friend is leading the efforts at https://sites.google.com/view/neverandnow-co/home.
    Do you know which are the critical races around Richmond?  I would suggest keeping
    an eye on the welcome chat and the  PA, VA, WV and NC chats. So you can welcome
    anyone from the region as they come on and share any information you are getting
    from your social media or otherwise. Introduce people who are doing similar work
    to each other and help them connect either by interest or region.

  content: The <#1242249109298221069> channel has daily training opportunities for
    how to support various efforts for the Presidential campaign. You should take
    your lead from that channel on any national election efforts. My social media
    approach has been trying the following. I stopped following any distractions,
    I'm currently only following people who I love to see succeed and those who lift
    me up. My first post was an honest video of myself letting folks know where I
    am emotionally and why it is important to me that I give this campaign my all.
    I use the posts from influencers I listen to with a supper short comment that
    connect the issue to future consequences and Kamala's  agenda and or qualifications.
    I dont know how to add pictures here so if you want to see an example you can
    see it on my instagram. thats the only platform i kinda know how to use so thats
    what im focusing on. t.mf.aidanator is my handle. its public so you dont have
    to follow me to see it.

  content: Hi y'all - we had a GREAT in-person event in a rural and formerly very
    red area of our county yesterday, but where there are lots of cheaper housing
    developments going up and new families = some of them must be Democrats. We launched
    canvassing, had a party after at a Black owned restaurant, and had activities
    for kids like making Swiftie bracelets for voting, karaoke and the DNC playlist,
    had free pizzas, and lots of signs and enthusiasm. One guy yelled "Harris can
    kiss my hairy ass" as he drove away like a baby - we shouted back "she doesn't
    want to, honey!" but we got more honks of support than mad hollers. Apparently
    our Republican committee is freaking out and want to know how they can have more
    events in that shopping center (clutches pearls, faints on couch). Just to say
    - hang in there, and keep getting out there. One lady who came to the event said
    as a Black woman with opinions she feels like such a target, but coming to see
    she's not alone meant a lot to her. We had Black elders there too, and y'all,
    their stories. You, in your community, probably know someone who remembers having
    to pay a poll tax in Virginia. We're NOT GOING BACK!

  content: I am a bit worried about VA-7. Spanberger was such a great Rep. and I volunteered
    for her last campaign. Lots of independents and Republicans loved that she was
    moderate and readily available to her constituents. IMO, Vindman doesn't have
    that same appeal and I'm not sure about skipping debates. At least Wextons old
    seat seems safe.

    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
