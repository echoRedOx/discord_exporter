Content: Western MT peeps: the mail sort facility for letters was moved to Spokane from Missoula with no public announcement, and it’s adding 2-3 days to mail times. Plan ahead if you mail in your ballot.

Content: Does it have to be recieved by election day? I thought it has to be postmarked by election day. I'm planning to vote in person but most people I know are voting by mail so I want to make sure I give them good info if I encourage people to vote early.

Content: They need to be RECEIVED by 8PM the day of the election. If you change your status to absentee ballot 30 days or less before the election, you must pick up the ballot at the election office.

Content: Also, Montanans need to start voting in every election. Skip one and you are marked “inactive” and your signature no longer counts for ballot initiatives. More Republican gamesmanship.

Content: Does that include primaries? I've been living in Minneapolis for 10 yrs. I thought I'd kept up with MT politics but guess I have some reading to do...I knew the signatures were a big deal but haven't heard about the "inactive" status.

Content: I don’t think it’s primaries or the local county elections, just any federal election. A bunch of people skipped midterms and got screwed. (“Every” was not specific enough, my mistake.)

Content: Late-but-not-too-late suggestion: If they are worried obout their ballot getting there in time,  and you are going to  vote in person, you are legally  allowed to drop off absentee ballots of anyone to whom you are a "caregiver, a family member, a household member, or an aquaintance,"  The new law says you can only bring in 6 ballots per election, but enforcement of that law is currently enjoined. So it's like speeding used to be.

Content: Hello @MT, it is Sunday morning October 6th, and I am here with a  short, friendly reminder that IF YOU DID NOT VOTE IN THE 2022 MID-TERM ELECTIONS IN MONTANA, YOU ARE MOST LIKELY NO LONGER REGISTERED TO VOTE IN MONTANA. 

You can check your registration status at https://iwillvote.com/, and get the form to register by mail, but YOUR APPLICATION TO REGISTER MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 7TH TO COUNT. Bring it to a post office. Ask (politely) to watch them postmark it if you try to mail it Monday. 

You can also check your registration status and download the forms you need to register at Montana Secretary of State  Christi Jacobsen's official page, https://votemt.gov/ Same due date applies. 

 IF YOU MISS THE MONDAY DEADLINE, YOU CAN STILL OFFICIALLY REGISTER AT ANY OF THE STATE'S 56 COUNTY ELECTION OFFICES UNTIL NOON THE DAY BEFORE ELECTION DAY (you can also register on election day, but maybe don't push your luck)
Here is a link to the addresses of all 56 Election Offices from Ms. Jacobsen's office: https://sosmt.gov/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?juwpfisadmin=false&action=wpfd&task=file.download&wpfd_category_id=23&wpfd_file_id=65879

Oh  wait, no it is not. These are the addresses to mail your applications in to. Most of them are PO boxes. It looks like most bigger towns have addresses for actual offices where you can pick up and drop off your registration in person - Helena has one, Missoula, Butte, even my birthplace Shelby is showing off their big Toole energy with a real office, not just a PO box. But if you're somewhere off in the boonies like Scobey or Billings or Great Falls, you might want to fill out an application TODAY and  hit the post office first thing in the morning tomorrow.

Content: I have an idea for a phonebanking event for Jon Tester, and wanted your input. We Montanans are passionate about our college football teams, and sometimes if a home has both Griz & Cat fans in it, it's "A House Divided." So it might be fun to bring Griz & Cats fans together for "A House Divided, United for Tester" virtual phonebank. Thoughts?

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.
