    \ just be videos of 30-60 sec bullet points explaining policies .. just basic\
    \ simple talk on kitchen table and social issues 1) does trickle down economics\
    \ work? 2) why trump tariffs are inflation 2.0 - simple messaging which really\
    \ is \u2018101\u2019 basic - and then have the short clips blasted throughout\
    \ insta, messaging etc (after they are approved). Is there a way we can accomplish\
    \ this please? I recall back in 2012 Obama had an interesting YouTube video explaining\
    \ why trickle down doesn\u2019t work which was really good and catchy"
