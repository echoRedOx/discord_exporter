  content: I've committed to wearing one of my campaign hats for Kamala and Tim each
    day, and in the past several weeks there's only been one person who has said go
    Trump. anyone else who makes a comment is so excited and thrilled for Kamala and
    Tim. There's this shared enthusiasm, like we're all on one team working together.
    I'm amazed how many people stop to chat!

    \ what made him change his mind was receiving a Trump email asking him to come\
    \ hold a sign for 15 min, for $10.  I asked him if he would see if he could provide\
    \ a copy with no identifying marks, for people to use, in the hopes of changing\
    \ more minds. I will post here if I get it. But just the news is great. Let\u2019\

    \ sending these emails to his supporters. I do love when these people do themselves\

  content: 'I would love some advice on how to find possibly undecided voters or potentially
    persuadable Trumpy voters on Threads and X. My algorithms are feeding me all blue
    voters for the most part. X is filled with so many trolls in the comments of any
    posts from right-wing news accounts that it''s hard to know where to bother engaging.
    Do we have any data on the value of engaging on X at all?


    That said, I''ve had some good conversations with a couple of blue voters who
    were posting cynical takes. I point out the need for encouraging engagement through
    positivity and a spirit of unity, and that''s been resonating. I''ve also been
    wearing down a couple of intelligent evangelical friends on FB who don''t like
    Trump but have been lied to about Kamala. It''s amazing how effective one can
    be when acknowledging people''s concerns rather than judging and arguing!


    Sincerely pro-life people are worried about the "unintended consequences" of the
    harsher abortion restrictions, and it''s easy to change people''s minds about
    economics if they''re not completely absorbed into the cult.'
