Can we get the 2024 platform posted and in a place where we can refer folks when they ask about issues/policy/goals?  It would also be good to have more issues info on the Harris-Walz website.  Thids came up during our phonebanking yesterday. (Sunday, August 25). Thanks!"

Asking now for the platform itself.  We know it was voted on and adopted.  We need this for those voters who ask our phone bankers about issues and policies they can expect the candidates to pursue or invest in... Looking for the document.  Thanks."
