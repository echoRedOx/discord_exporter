  content: I am an FB Moderator for Texas. I will also post this same query to that
    Slack, but I also wanted to ask here.  Several folks have been asking about physical  office
    locations or names of state level staff for Texas. I am sure that is in the works,
    but is there a specific area online where that will be updated to democrats.org
    or texasdemocrats.org?   Thanks.  Jay E
