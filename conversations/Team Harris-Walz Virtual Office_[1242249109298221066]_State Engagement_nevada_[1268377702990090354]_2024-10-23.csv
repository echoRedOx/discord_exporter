Under current state law (N.R.S. AB 321, § 11, 13, 15), Nevada has now started counting absentee ballots.  Thats why its very important to deliver your ballot if you can"

From my reading of these NV web pages, residents can register and vote on the same day, if done in person at a polling location.  Can that be done during Early Voting and on Election Day or just on Election Day?
