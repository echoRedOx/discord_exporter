  content: Also, be aware, there are multiple groups of Swifties campaigning. Swifties
    for Harris is at that Facebook and Swifties for Kamala is mentioned in the article
    I linked. But we can't vet or endorse any of them since they could be started
    by anyone. Please keep that in mind and use caution with non-official campaigns
    (at your own risk). Thank you.

    \ and I recently launched a grassroots campaign called Creatures for Kamala. \n\
    \nWe asked ourselves: Who benefits from Harris being President? \n\nThe answer:\
    \ Every. Living. Thing.\n\nSo we\u2019re offering a collection of free digital\
    \ artwork for people to download, in both English and Espa\xF1ol, that features\
    \ a wide variety of creatures with a stake in this election.\n\nThe call-to-action\
    \ is simple: print and put up a poster. In your home, at your office, at school,\
    \ a park, a coffee shop. Somewhere. Anywhere.\n\nWe currently have five posters.\
    \ There are many more creatures to come. \U0001F43F\uFE0F \n\nHere\u2019s our\

    (within the HFP campaign), so you can post this one anywhere on the server if
    you like. (Harris for President, noted at bottom of the graphic, is the big umbrella
    campaign everything official falls under). Thank you! I am not sure on the other
    two, I would have to check sources for the organizations hosting these events.
    Feel free to DM them to me if you'd like me to check.

  content: Campaign finance law does not allow us to post links to non-official fundraising
    events whatsoever. If it's a phone bank or similar activity, without fundraising,
    it is allowed in this channel only. If there is any fundraising, it's against
    campaign finance law. Not our rules, it's just the law.

  content: Hi Steven! You might know this already, but just in case you didn't know
    YouTube recently also added a Community Notes feature, which can help combat misinformation.
    I believe on the mobile app you can opt in to the waiting list by clicking Settings,
    then General, then "Help Inform Viewers." It'll take a bit to get approved, but
    accounts that aren't freshly made should eventually be able to access this! Apologies
    in advance for any new or evolving information - I believe this feature is relatively
    new for YouTube

  content: Good morning! Yesterday I posted a link to a postcarding group for one
    of the volunteers who was asking for opportunities, but it got deleted with the
    "Strict Fundraising Rules" warning. I'm not sure why, unless it had a link somewhere
    on the page that either offered postcards for sale or a donation tab. If that's
    the case, most, if not all, of the many groups I write postcards with would get
    removed. Is it okay to list the groups here? If not, type "democratic post card
    campaigns" into a Google search and a lengthy list of opportunities will pop up.

  content: I'm new to this whole thing, but if we wanted to advertise a community
    gathering in support of Harris - Walz, and were planning on encouraging fundraising
    at that gathering, would we be able to post it here, or is that not allowed? My
    understanding that was we COULD post non-official campaign events in this channel?

    called *Field Team 6*. It is another organization that focuses heavily on voter
    turnout, voter registration, and more. It reaches out to voters who usually do
    not participate in elections but are Democrats/leaning. For example, this week

  content: <@389839010576465936> this is super cool. I know we've had phone bank vols
    talking to people who needed help with this. Consider adding it to the state channels
    where it's applicable to get some localized attention. I can add it to the <#1268378299428634727>
    channel for you. You can add channels to your Discord through the Channels and
    Roles tab at the top of your menu (and you can remove them after if you don't
    want access to them anymore).

    \ I\u2019ll do that! \nI just got onboarded to VoteRiders, and wow, there are\
    \ thousands of open cases. So many people need IDs across many states. The organization\
    \ trains well, gives you the choice of state to help out with (I chose GA since\
    \ it is a battleground state), and gives you an expense card to use for fees associated\
    \ with ordering IDs, Birth Certificates, Social Security Cards, etc. for voters.\

  content: Hi <@1264664181697675285> I personally love this site and have been using
    it, but since we know that many of those organizations solicit donations to sustain
    their work, we can't publicize the site in this Discord server. I'm going to remove
    it, but wanted to give you a little insight into why. Campaign finance laws are
    no joke and we don't want to give anyone any reason to undermine the win we're
    working so hard to achieve.

  content: The fine print at bottom says it's opting you in to all their stuff. The
    weblink itself is an every action website link. This channel for non-official
    events is really for events only and not recruiting into other orgs and such,
    which is what links like this are doing. If they are on events.democrats.org or
    Mobilize, and they are not doing any fundraising, they are allowed here.

    is not official DNC. We got this confirmed this morning. The fundraising laws
    are very strict so in order to remain in compliance with the law it is better
    to be safe and not allow any links or mentions of groups who are also doing any
    fundraising, or taking donations, even on behalf of the campaign.

  content: I'm wondering about the utility of having this channel at all, given the
    difficulty with posting non-campaign events. I haven't seen any come through that
    don't get pulled down due to the fundraising laws, which are a legit problem.
    I wonder if rather than posting directly, these events could be DM'd to a Mod
    to vet and post if it meets the criteria. That way the channel can get locked
    down and cleaned up. Right now it's a bit of a mess trying to sort through all
    the autobot fundraising warnings and back and forth regarding these restrictions.

  content: 'Hi Carol! Some examples of the non-official events that can be posted
    here are: debate parties thrown by volunteers, phone banking/text banking for
    other candidates, and other types of organizing actions that don''t include fundraising.
    It''s also helpful to direct individuals here if they are looking to connect with
    others on non-official events and actions. You are right that the fundraising
    explanation can clog up the channel. I think we had a more recent surge of fundraising
    posts in the last 24 hours. If it starts to be a regular thing we can look for
    a solution that provides the poster with an explanation, but doesn''t take over
    the channel.'

  content: So are letter- and postcard-writing campaigns like Vote Forward actually
    effective at turning out _specifically Democratic_ voters? I've heard that they're
    efficient at turning out voters in general, compared to other tactics, but I want
    to focus my efforts on increasing Democratic votes. Letter-writing could be a
    fun activity for me, and it's easier to do during downtime at school because I
    don't have a laptop. I know they target some groups that are statistically more
    likely to vote Democratic, but I don't know what they do with voter registration
    (or how they even have a list of registered voters to send to? they're not a political
    party)

    to your KoFi, Patreon, and Store those are all fundraising. So unfortunately we
    can't have your event here. You could make an event on https://events.democrats.org/host/
    and that would be super.

  content: Yes, they are very legit. And effective. I've texted and postcarded with
    them for years. Great group...and they only register Democrats. Lots of other
    voter registration groups are non partisan and often wind up registering more
    Republicans.

  content: <@1266164208928686110> Hi Nieta. We cannot mention the the event you posted
    or request anyone contact you in DM to get more info. The event is a fundraiser.
    Only non-official events without any fundraising can be on our server unless they
    are our events hosted by the DNC, per Campaign Finance Rules. It's the law. Thank
    you for your compliance.

  content: I checked. It is a rally for Harris, but it is not a fundraiser. Where
    is the information that states that? They have a donate button on the website
    because they are running for office themselves. That is why I removed the link
    from the flyer in the first place.

  content: I think bots are deleting events that are not in violation of the rules.
    I know that Neurodivergent Voters for Harris happening on Thursday, 9/26 just
    a call to inform voters how to get involved and to vote only. I understand that
    the are rules but I think instead of allowing the bots just to delete a post.

    a wonderful way to write postcards, and they are active year round--their Facebook

  content: Good for you for taking care of yourself and knowing what you need. I used
    to be really anxious/scared of in-person canvassing as well. I decided to push
    through it and got pretty used to it to the point I became a local organizer.
    My friends got used to me bugging them to come out, I'd buy donuts or treats,
    we'd all get our fave hot drinks and head out. It's not for everyone though, that's
    why I'm so glad we have lots of ways to get involved virtually! Are you phonebanking
    or friendbanking with us?

    are perfect for this channel. I agree that the Massive Swing Sates looks great,
    but somehow field team 6 manage to get a donate link on the mobilize page (I have
    not seen this before) so unfortunately that one has to come down, but you can
    describe it for find another way for folks to sign up that would be okay.

  content: Hi, Alex! I don't know which event it was, but you can feel free to dm
    me and we can take a look at it. A lot of event links have donation buttons, QR
    codes, links, etc. right there, and due to campaign finance law we can't have
    those on this official Harris server.

    has some great postcard campaigns going to GA, OH, and elsewhere, and they are
    writing right up to the deadlines for mailing and expecting postcards to arrive
    by Nov. 5. You need to get approved as a writer, but that is straightforward,
    and the website explains the process well. I have been writing with them almost
    since they started, and I think it's a terrific group and very well run.
