If a person has already voted, how do I code that?
If someone answers and says the person I'm asking for is not home,what do I code that?"

If they already voted and the script doesn't have that option(some do) select strong Harris (or whatever appropriate), how they plan to vote and skip to the end or end survey early after you've answered those calls.  For the last question the survey response is call back."
