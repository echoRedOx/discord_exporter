Content: I've got one in very rural, red Douglas county. It's the only one I've seen around me, but yesterday I drove over to coos bay to do some hiking & I saw 3 Kamala for President signs (and about 6 trump signs) in my 2&1/2 hour drive. I was so excited, I cheered everytime I saw one! they were "unofficial" signs, haven't seen them before.

Content: Thanks for asking! I'm doing just fine with my lone Harris/Walz lawn sign, lol. Don't socialize much with the locals, tbh; I work remotely, though we're friendly enough with our Maga neighbors. My hubby and I are planning to join an informal democratic monthly group get together to start building a better like minded network. Even considering getting involved in local county democratic party!

Content: Rally at the corner of Hwy 101 and 42S in Bandon drew about 75 people to stand on the corner with signs. Significant positive feedback from passers-by -- lots of horn honking.  Coos has been a super deep red county ... The chairman of the Board of Commissioners is a convicted J6 participant.

Content: I'm terrible at phone banking, but I'm volunteering with the VOTE team now to help behind the scenes, and am buying the post office out of stamps to write letters and postcards. I've even been able to arrange an event at work next week so that people can get together using some of our annual volunteer time off to write letters for Vote Forward. I didn't think I was going to get away with it but the fact that VF is a 501c3 and has non-partisan campaigns gives me plausible deniability. üòá

Content: I never forget the shock when I volunteered for the Kerry campaign and found out oregon is almost purple! I've noticed on a lot of the political maps on TV that were only listed as "leans blue". When I checked registration, we had over 990,000 dems,  700,000 reps, and 1,000,000 independents! We need those independents to vote blue up and down the ballot, at least this one time.

Content: Is Oregon complacent because usually by the time our results are in, the national election is already decided, plus, traditionally we're pretty strongly blue overall? We can't be complacent because we're becoming pretty purple in our local elections, winning the Governor's race by a narrow margin. Oregon is interesting because it's very blue in the Portland-Metro area, Salem, and Eugene areas, but pretty red elsewhere where the populations are smaller.

Content: I think that might be some of it. Especially for the presidential primary. Our primary is _so late_ and nearly every election cycle by the time our primary rolls around the major party candidate lists have been severely winnowed at best, or already decided on at worst. I would be so interested if going to a single primary date, or at least primaries that are a lot closer together, would benefit campaigns for some of the more progressive candidates.

Content: I'm in the 3rd, so Blumenauer. I'm so mixed on him, he's had that seat for so long and I wonder if it's time for newer blood there. But also it's hard to give up the connections and leadership he has by virtue of seniority. And we could certainly get a lot worse there.

Do you have any time or interest in knocking on doors at new apartment complexes in our area or to encourage people to register to vote or UPDATE their registration? I made 1000 postcards to distribute so I'd love have some help with this project or someone to go out with. Today is NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION DAY so I'm going back out today & every day this week. OR05 may be more critical to work because Bynum is running against a republican incumbent... Either way, I hope to see you in the "field"

Content: Hey, all, I am so happy to be able to volunteer from home. I am registered to make calls several times this week. I have talked to several persons who are planning to vote for Harris-Walz, many T-ers, and lots and lots of hangups. It's the T-ers I hope will stay on the line so I can genuinely connect, but it is nearly impossible, very acrimonious and hostile. The Harris-Walz calls are very uplifting and cancel out the nasty. Go Democrats!!!

Content: Organized a volunteering event at work today and together we wrote about 250 letters for Vote Forward in about 2 hours.  That's a good number of letters, but I'm also hoping it will wind up being a baby step towards more active involvement for some of our employees who are newly outraged but not sure what to do with that energy.  <:Ivoted:1252808222868504576>   Anyway, it would be a very easy and worthwhile group activity for, say, a lunch hour or happy hour after work.

Content: Hi Holly, I'm knocking doors almost daily now.  It's a lot easier when you go with someone else! Let me know if you'd like to go and we can schedule something together. Right now I'm focused on apartment complexes reminding people to get registered if they've moved & talking about Janelle Bynum in OR05. It sounds like you've got a great volunteer team at work so keep up the great work! Door knocking isn't for everyone but it's great that people have other ways to contribute that don't involved doors or phones.

Content: Also important to note! Please make sure we are getting the messaging out that our Secretary of State elections this year are SUPER important. Dennis Linthicum, the republican candidate, straight up says he wants to roll back universal mail-in voting and is openly spouting off trump conspiracies on a stolen election. Tobias Reed is the dem in the running and we should get some word out about him! I‚Äôve been networking with anyone I can that will listen about it.

Content: Agreed. Also kinda helps in our state that the second Dennis opened his mouth it became pretty clear he hates LGBTQ rights. Still, nothing for granted. Gotta keep up the joyful work.

Content: do you happen to know where I could get my hands on a yard sign for Dexter? I looked on her site and on the Multnomah County Dems but couldn't find anything. (I did however fill out the county Dems volunteer interest form while I was there. This election has been the kick in the pants I think I needed to do more locally!)

Content: Hi <@1054909991468929104> this is great info you are sharing abou the Mult Dems. Can you share their email or phone instead of the webpage, unfortunately the web page has a donate button which goes to a diffrent campaign than HVF, and that's a problem for campaign finance law.

Content: Just saw your post today. Multnomah County dems was at the 2024 Salem Pride in the Park with a table & I was there floating around talking about registration & Project 2025 too. It was well attended & I was really glad to see Mult Dems there. Clackamas Dems couldn't have a booth at the Clackamas pride event but Clackamas County Clerk was there to encourage voter registration & I walked around that event talking about Project 2025 too. The Salem event was on 9/21/24.

Content: Hi, Karen. I'm in Portland, too! District 3,  to be exact. I'm working with AZ Dems and I'd probably reach out to the county parties and see where it's most needed. My partner has been spending time in Tucson and he said that they really need it. Do you want me to poke around and see if I can find something?

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!

Content: <@&1245910824003043349> Early voting has started in many of the swing states, so this weekend is CRITICAL to our GOTV efforts. It's also incredibly important that we make sure that people with mail in ballots have gotten their ballots and understand how to return them. This is such important work, and we have to close strong. But we can't make our 10 million call goal without your help. If you're experienced, you can go straight to our dialer [here ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=933f666e-c699-46e3-ac92-12d9cf6f3992) - if you're new, please join us over in <#1242256751445934262> to get connected to some training! (If you don't have that, go to  <id:customize>  and choose "talk to voters in key states.") Even making a few calls helps. Many hands make light work. Will you please come over and join us?

Content: Multnomah County Oregon Voters:  If you put your ballot in this drop box call the county board of elections at 503-988-8683 to request a new ballot IMMEDIATELY! The incumbent Republican in Orgons 5th congressional district only won by 7,299 votes, or 2.1 points.  This is the result of the false lies from MAGA republicans.  Dont think that your vote dosent matter. https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2024/10/a-second-ballot-box-fire-this-time-in-clark-county-destroys-hundreds-of-ballots.html
