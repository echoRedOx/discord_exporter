Content: Hi there. Is there a kudos channel? I have been online since 1992, volunteering online at election time since 2000. This is the best organized I’ve ever seen the party, and it’s the most aligned with my values it’s ever been (so glad we’re not playing Lucyball anymore). 

Anyway, just got an email from Frances H encouraging me to phone bank again (I will just have to time it right from Berlin). It’s this personalization (name) plus automation (really nice templates can someone tell the dccc to use the same designer and lose their gaudy harangues?) that had me want to give kudos. 

What a great team and infrastructure. And candidate.
