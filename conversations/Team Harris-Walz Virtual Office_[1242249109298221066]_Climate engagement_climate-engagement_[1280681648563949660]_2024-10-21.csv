I posted in the volunteer welcome section ‚ÄúHi! I‚Äôm in New Jersey, and I‚Äôve been volunteering for Democratic campaigns since Dukakis/Bentsen in 1988 because I was concerned about wetlands protection and the hole in the ozone layer. For a long time I voted in all presidential elections but didn‚Äôt pay much attention to state/local elections until my county started a cruel and dangerous deer hunt in our county parks. I threw myself into local politics. I now vote in every election and I‚Äôm the Democratic municipal vice chair for my town, and co-chair of our state Progressive Caucus. Looking forward to driving over state lines to knock on doors in Pennsylvania!‚Äù I‚Äôve worked for Greenpeace, the U.S. EPA, and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. I‚Äôm vegan and I now work for Animal Protection League of NJ. Whenever a poll asks what my number one issue is, I say climate change."

I've watched over the years as our Christmases in New England have gradually turned from snow and ice to rain and mud; our Octobers having more days that feel like July; and just last year needing to wear masks outside not due to covid, but to protect from inhaling wildfire smoke from the other side of the continent. Climate change is already impacting my own backyard as well as the rest of the world. Tackling this crisis is my number one priority for this election, one that we know Trump and his oil baron donors plan to do worse than nothing about. I believe there is no other choice for those of us who want a livable planet for ourselves and our loved ones: we must elect Kamala Harris in November to give ourselves a fighting chance for a sustainable future."

There was supposed to be a ban but it never happened though some of the stores have. Biden has been amazing on the climate and there is no way I can support Trump.

Would love to help with drafting texts of any length, messaging, policy research, and/or keeping the team organized. Currently doing a climate-ed fellowship and have integrated many sustainability practices in my daily life. And I live in Germany, where recycling and using cloth bags at the shop are just what you do, bike lanes and trains are everywhere, and even the discount supermarket chains have their own plant-based product lines. I recently joined Zooms for Train Lovers for H/W and YIMBYs for H/W and was excited to learn about all the progress being made across the country. On those calls, many people asked: ‚Äúhow could [X or Y climate/mobility/regulation] work?‚Äù A lot of things they asked about, are already taken for granted by people in other countries. Why should the US be left behind? With H/W it won‚Äôt be. The IRA, for example, concerned many business leaders over here because it made the US more competitive. Just last night, in fact, I was reading a Reddit discussion about whether the IRA will prompt a large US company to move its EU-based facility back to the US‚Äîbringing the related jobs back to American shores."

Combatting climate change is especially meaningful to me as a hiker, birder, animal enthusiast, and general nature and outdoors lover. I am currently in Massachusetts, where I thought I would at least be safe from the wildfire smoke and heat that I was used to after living in California for 8 years. Not so. This summer, we had at least 3 or 4 full weeks where it was impossible to do any activities outside due to extreme heat or bad air quality from Canadian wildfires. Additionally, worsening hurricane seasons mean more and more heavy surf and beach erosion at my favorite beaches, and fewer resting areas for migrating shorebirds. And of course now, we have a worsening influx of mosquito-bourne viruses in the state including EEE and West Nile---and as someone with preexisting health conditions, I am now still hesitant to spend much time outdoors even as we enter the fall. I look forward to engaging with all of you so we can get Kamala and Tim elected and protect our environment!"

My cousins (guys in their 40s who actually drive the tractors) are probably the last of our family to farm. We have a wealth of wisdom in our family farm operators when it comes to conserving natural resources, but family farms are dying thanks to federal policies that favor corporate farms. We can and must do better.  P.S. My family's farmers are all Dems. I didn't know there was such a thing as a Republican farmer until I first ran for office in 2006."

I am so excited and hopeful for more federal leadership on incentives for renewable energy, rail, environmental justice, climate adaptation and more.

It's why we also need a Dem House, so they can pass legislation to fill in major gaps and try to buy back progress that was made but then shut down by one federal court or another. If he wants to preserve the environment, he needs to support candidates who's going to address current issues in the judiciary. I'm not elated with her position on fracking but I also understand it from a political POV‚Äîshe needs to win PA to be able to win the election and my guess is she'll strive to work with industry on some kind of incremental shift away from it if she wins.

(As do I).  Recently our *insert curseword of choice* governor tried to sneak through a proposal to plow under nine state parks to make golf courses and pickleball courts.  When the docs were leaked, there was HUGE and INSTANT bipartisan outrage.  I think emphasizing Project 2025‚Äôs elimination of the NOAA, which we all count on to keep us safe from hurricanes, would incur similar bipartisan outrage here, if more people knew.

It is one of the few countries with this advantage. if we wish to continue to enjoy such a privelege we need to take action to reduce our energy costs in each home  by promoting reduction in use such as turning off lights when not in use, storing water on site such as rain water for irrigation needs at home, adding green energy support items such as solar panels etc. By reducing energy consumption, we can each help with reduction in energy needed. this will help us to look more into options of generating more energy through wind turbines as our energy consumption reduction, may be used to start the wind turbines, and capture more clean energy."

Think: Near real-time updates so pilots could find the fastest and safest way through storms and efficiently routing flights from gate to gate.

Not sure how much of that got into any current systems, but from air traffic control to farmer's reports, eliminating and/or privatizing weather data is a terrible idea."

‚ñ° Elimination of Climate Change References: Advises eradicating climate change references in government.

‚ñ° Environmental Agencies: Proposes downsizing the EPA and abolishing NOAA.

‚ñ° Emissions Regulations: Suggests relaxing greenhouse gas emissions regulations and preventing states from implementing stricter vehicular emissions standards.
‚ñ° Fossil Fuels: Encourages increased fossil fuel production and opposes renewable energy expansion.
‚ñ° Repeals: Plans to repeal climate-related legislations like the Inflation Reduction Act.

Reduction or Elimination of Renewable Energy Subsidies: Project 2025 promotes a shift away from government incentives for renewable energy development.

Government Overhaul: Proposes significant restructuring of federal agencies, advocating for direct presidential control over the federal bureaucracy, including job protections removal for thousands of government employees.

The initiative includes firing over 50,000 federal employees and replacing them with individuals loyal to Trump‚Äôs vision, effectively transforming civil service positions into political appointments through the reinstatement of the ""Schedule F"" executive order.

This plan aims to eliminate civil service protections, allowing for the reclassification of federal workers as political appointees. The proposal also involves dismantling or downsizing various federal agencies, such as the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, and reallocating their functions to other departments or eliminating them entirely.

The overarching goal of Project 2025 is to reshape the federal government to be more responsive to the president's directives, potentially eroding checks and balances and altering the nonpartisan nature of the civil service."

We are now projected to reach the ‚Äú30-year average‚Äù of 1.5C between 2032-2034, 16-18 years ahead of 2050 (Paris Agreement).

Under the Paris Agreement, we must reduce carbon emissions by over 45% by 2030.

At 1.5C - We have 70-90% loss of coral reefs, 1 million tonnes of fish die, we have a 100% increase in flood risk, 1 billion people are exposed to severe heat waves every 5 years.

At 2.0C - We have one ice-free arctic summer every 10 years, 3 million tonnes of fish die, almost 100% of the coral reefs decline, 2.7 Billion people are exposed to severe heat waves every 5 years and we have a 170% increase in flood risk."

A new report released by Adrien Bilal, an economist at Harvard and Diego K√§nzig, an economist at Northwestern University says:

A 1C increase in global temperature leads to a 12% decline in world gross domestic product (GDP), the researchers found, a far higher estimate than that of previous analyses.

The paper places a much higher estimate on economic losses than previous research, calculating a social cost of carbon, which is the cost in dollars of damage done per each additional ton of carbon emissions, to be $1,056 per ton

A 3C temperature increase will cause ‚Äúprecipitous declines in output, capital and consumption that exceed 50% by 2100‚Äù the paper states. This economic loss is so severe that it is ‚Äúcomparable to the economic damage caused by fighting a war domestically and permanently‚Äù, it adds.

Climate Change as known government National Security Threat:

¬∑¬†¬† Climate change and energy are two key issues that will play a significant role in shaping the future security environment,"" noting that ""climate change, energy security, and economic stability are inextricably linked."" -DoD, 2017
¬∑¬†¬†‚ÄúWe recognize that climate change is a threat to U.S. national security and the well-being of the American people,‚Äù Farnan said during a press event Wednesday.‚Äù ‚Äì US Army
¬∑¬†‚ÄúClimate change has serious implications for national security .. Climate change is dramatically increasing the demand for military operations and, at the same time, impacting our readiness and our ability to meet those demands while imposing unsustainable costs on the department,""- DOD, 2022
o¬†¬† Climate Change has been recognized as a National Security Threat in several U.S. Military Field Manuals and strategic documents.
¬∑¬†Department of Defense (DoD) Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap (2014)
¬∑¬†National Security Strategy (NSS)
¬∑¬†National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)

I went to COP28 in Dubai, and read the Institute for Economics and Peace predicted 1.2B (1/8th of current world pop) people would be permanently or temporarily displaced from Climate Change in 2050. This came from their 2020 Ecological Threat report which was based on the IPCC AR5 report (2014), old data. We already see climate migrants flooding into the UK and EU. Building infrastructure + Buildings to old standards (using old climate data) causes more displacement faster!"

3. Convey Harris vs. Trump‚Äôs position on climate change.
4. Establish targeted campaigns to help increase voter turn out between ages 18-24 (college campuses, social media, etc).

If you are passionate about the UN SDG‚Äôs, hitting the Paris Agreement goals and would like to help these groups establish their own program to drive the above, please DM me. 

It would be great if anyone wants to follow suit and target the ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù and ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù groups within college campuses and wants to help get them on group calls, so they can leverage one another‚Äôs skills to drive voter turn out and awareness.

Yesterday, I was running deliveries of water and groceries down the road, to towns where every bridge over the Nolichucky is gone, entire livelihoods gone, and even lives lost. This is a key opportunity for us to focus on what Harris and Walz will do to course-correct and protect our communities and our ecosystems, and to reverse the effects of climate change. Ideally, we would have a one-page infographic that addresses the devastation down here, the basics of climate change, and what the Harris-Walz administration will do to address these issues. This would allow us to connect with our community over this crisis and use it to create real, lasting change."

Trump wants to delete the words climate change from all government documents. The appointed GOP people will likely try to do the same in the states they govern and are the Senator or House of Representatives for.

If Trump were to take office and delete climate change from gov‚Äôt docs, perform significant cuts to FEMA and allow for cities and roads to be built using old code, the cost to fix it after combined with the damage from the intensifying storms would be significant. This is all the more reason why he can never take office and we have to win the Senate and the House, in addition to Presidency in as many states as possible. We cannot continue to build and rebuild these cities using old climate risk maps and old code just to save money while doing so. People‚Äôs lives are at stake.

I participate with several Florida groups:  FL Victory 2024, Orange County Dems, Florida Women for Harris, and more.   And blue Florida has been working its a$$ off to get our state, and the country, the electoral votes and the blue wave that the Harris/Walz team needs.  üåä In some cases, people are putting themselves at personal risk to do this, because you know how it can be putting yourself out there publicly in deep red territory.  (Or you can imagine).  And these folks are doing it ALL!  Canvassing, sign waving, postcarding, house parties, information tables, post-its on restroom doors, and more.  We‚Äôre out there for education and equality and the climate and reproductive rights every single day.   And you want to talk phone banking?  Florida has had its own equivalent of Dawn to Dusk Dialing for MONTHS, and I get sent new dialer links almost daily because of all the good folks hammering through those lists like nobody‚Äôs business.  

But Florida is still recovering from Helene and now Milton is on its way.  I‚Äôm typing this now from an area predicted to be in the direct path (but not under evacuation orders, because we obey those and we listen to facts, not nonsense).  People are doing their best but they are scared.  We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming.  And in addition to whatever we face, we may lose power for days or weeks in the tropical heat, and that‚Äôs no joke.

That means the campaign work in Florida has to be put on hold while we deal with survival.  

So, please, if you‚Äôre grateful to have a roof over your head and chilled food in the refrigerator and a grocery store that‚Äôs stocked and power for your devices, take a few extra minutes in the next few days and make some extra calls.  Make up the slack for what Florida wants to do and can‚Äôt.  

And we‚Äôll be right back in there to help as soon as we‚Äôre on our feet again.  Because that‚Äôs what we do for each other in a world that cares.  Thank you!"

Withdrawing from the development banks could have large implications for low-income countries as the US is the largest shareholder of the World Bank.

Also remember, he wants to get rid of FEMA, delete any reference to ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù in all gov‚Äôt docs, exit the Paris Agreement, UNFCC, World Bank, IMF, immediately repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and substantially increase Int‚Äôl tariffs, potentially setting off trade wars with others, including China. 

If you want to understand how bad our country currently is in protecting us against climate change because of all the lobbying and what cities face the biggest risk, check out FEMA‚Äôs building resilience tracker: https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/building-science/bcat.

We cannot afford to roll back climate resilience regulations/standards in the various U.S. cities or states. It‚Äôs proven GOP led states and cities use older codes. We need as many of them using the latest 2024 building code, energy code and green construction code possible. We need the cities engineered to withstand the latest risk called out in the most up to date climate risk maps from NOAA, NASA, Berkeley Earth. 

Allowing us to build cities to outdated codes and outdated climate risk maps (flooding, fire, drought/heat, intensifying storms and sea level rise) will compromise our ability to save lives and limit the destruction. 

There are three justices in their 70‚Äôs with two likely to retire in the next election. We cannot have the GOP have more control of the Supreme Court as we argue about who is to blame, who needs to pay, and what happens with water rights. 

The extreme heat will bring droughts and cause water/food shortages and cripple our electricity grids (A/C demand). We need control of the House, Senate and Presidency!

We also need to ensure the voters also focus on the judges in their areas!"

We are really seeing its impacts,‚Äù said Jackie Wong, a senior advisor to the NRDC Action Fund, an environmental political advocacy group that has endorsed Kamala Harris. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just about climate. This is also about public health and about jobs and about revitalizing American manufacturing.‚Äù

Trump and his advisers and spokespeople have said he would seek to roll back the law‚Äôs spending, a step Wong said ‚Äúwould be devastating for climate and economic health.‚Äù
