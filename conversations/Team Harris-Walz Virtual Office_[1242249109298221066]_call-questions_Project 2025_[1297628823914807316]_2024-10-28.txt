Content: I would point out that it was written by staffers who worked in the Trump Administration when he was President, and published by the Heritage Foundation, whose recommendations for the Supreme Court were accepted and nominated by Trump to the Supreme court. He's closely tied to both groups and many of those former staffers are going to be in his next Administration if he wins.
