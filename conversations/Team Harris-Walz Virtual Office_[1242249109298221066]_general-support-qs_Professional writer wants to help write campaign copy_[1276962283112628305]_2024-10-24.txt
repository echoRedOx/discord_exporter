Content: Hi, I'm a longtime Harris supporter (I voted for her for San Francisco DA) and I'd like to help her campaign. I am a professional writer. I know you must need reams of copy written over the next 74 days (and a wakeup) and I would like to help if I can. Thank you. #new #volunteer #writing

Content: Hi Blake! While we are officially affiliated with the DNC, we are only the national online volunteer branch, mostly volunteers from the nationwide online training events. We aren't the staff who work directly with Harris-Walz on the campaign writing/messaging, we just distribute it. 

That said, as a professional writer myself,  I love your enthusiasm and passion for this. Let me get you the link to the currently available positions, which would have to be applied for directly, not here. üòâ

Content: Communications might be a good place to start but these jobs are for specific cities, mostly not remote excepting a few data analysis positions. **I'm not sure how to reach the same team for any volunteer work but if I find out, I'll let you know!**
