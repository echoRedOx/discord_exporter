  content: Hmm yeah I mean when it comes to my family, I can't convince them of anything
    especially since Kamala was a part of the administration they hated because it
    was too left wing. Some people may be too far gone in that sense. If they were
    left wing and didn't think Biden didn't enough progressively, I think you can
    look at the Harris-Walz combo and see that its a bit more left inherently and
    whats already being talked about.

  content: I know 1000000% how you feel. Its crazy that the people your closest to
    in many ways will be the hardest to have these conversations with.

  content: Yep. Tis unfortunate, but thank goodness we can talk to so many more people
    than our family. That's how we complete this mission!
