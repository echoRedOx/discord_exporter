Content: I have had many people who do not want to share who they are voting for, FYI: virtually all women, and all in GA. This presents a problem when trying to move forward in the call to see if they want polling info. I suspect they are pro Harris, because they take the call and talk to me comfortably, and one said she would volunteer for the dems! I would liek to click lean-harris in these situations. Or can we add a "do not want to disclose" option so that we can move forward with data about polling places?

Content: <@1294056635165184063>  I think "does not want to disclose"  sounds like a good idea -- make the suggestion in your debrief form.  "Undecided" would also be a good option.  If they are coded as undecided, they will likely get another call, but will not be counted in the "Harris" category for prediction purposes.  I will post the debrief form link in calls-team

Content: thanks for the note, undecided basically ends the call. I will add to my debrief, I might have already.
