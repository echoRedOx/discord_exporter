Content: <@818861190779240449> So sorry about that. We really appreciate you wanting to make calls with us. If that ever occurs in the future, please come here to ask for help. We have moderators on shift to try to help with these things. Maybe you'll sign up for a future phone banking shift and give it another try? <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>
