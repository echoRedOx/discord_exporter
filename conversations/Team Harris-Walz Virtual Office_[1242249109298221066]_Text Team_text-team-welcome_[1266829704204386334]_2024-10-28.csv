Thanks for adding me, I really appreciate it.    I texted for the DNC back in 2020 back when the texting platforms were the legacy version of Spoke (before Scale to Win adopted it), Thrutext, and Hustle.  I had to be familiar with all 3 of them back then, because each texting campaign used a different platform to textbank.  Since I haven't done texting since the 2020 election cycle, I had to take the new training last night.    I am currently volunteering on the DNC Special Projects team as well, so I may not have as much time to text now.  However, I will check in when I have the time to text.<:thumbup:1252804076849074276>"

## We are increasing server security

‚ùì What do YOU need to do? Check to see if you have a phone number on your account. Phone numbers have to be mobile numbers. Landline and VOIP won't work. If you have not, set up and **verify your phone number**. For more information on how to check or verify your phone number on your Discord account, use this [support guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20you%20can%20also%20verify,beside%20the%20Phone%20Number%20section!) and scroll down to ‚ÄúVerify Your Phone Number‚Äù.

üõë If your phone number is not verified by **Sept. 16th**, you will not be able to send messages or interact in the server until verified.

üîê To achieve the best security within this Discord server, our admins will be enabling the strictest verification level available to us. This change will occur on **Monday, September 16**. By increasing our security, we will be able to verify all current server members, AND protect against bad actors infiltrating our community during the final stretch of this campaign! 

‚úÖ Your phone number will not be shared with the campaign, or anyone on our server. Only Discord will have this information. For more on this, please see [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy). 

ü§é If you have any questions or trouble, please ask a moderator. Thank you for helping us to create the safest, and best, volunteer community!"

Go to your devise and enter this link into Google: https://events.democrats.org/event/672393/ 

Scroll down to the section that says sign up and fill in your information, then click the date and time that works best for you. You should then receive a message by text saying your confirmed for training.

As for a scroll issue, if you are on a mobile devise scroll down by swiping up with your finger, if on PC with mouse use the roller on the mouse and scroll down. If on laptop place two fingers on the pad and swipe up with them. I hope this answered you question."

I wanted to reach out before Kamala takes the stage to debate Trump tonight.

I don‚Äôt have to tell you what you already know: She is ready.

There is such a clear contrast between Kamala and Trump, and I can‚Äôt wait for millions of people to see the split screen in real time.

It‚Äôs simple: Kamala is going to be talking about moving us forward. Trump is going to lie and talk about himself. 

Kamala will lead with the belief that we‚Äôre strongest when we fight for what we believe in -- not against what we fear. But she needs this team by her side, especially tonight. 

So I have to ask: Will you support Kamala and Democrats all across the nation by chipping in $40 or even just $5 before tonight‚Äôs debate? It‚Äôd mean so much to Kamala and me. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/p2p-240910-depdu?refcode=misc_3_fl

Thank you so much. We only have 56 days left. Let‚Äôs help her win this thing.

I did the thing on Reach where you search for a person's name and you tag who they support, what issues matter to them, etc. I entered my girlfriend's name as a test. She has never signed up to volunteer and has never donated. She now got a text from the campaign today, about 2 months later. Is this info collected used for text banking? Or just unrelated and somehow she just got signed up ?"

Thank you for everything you do! I was sent here by our lead mods for a very special ask, and I hope you‚Äôve got the time to listen.

If you‚Äôve got spare time between texts <:typingkermit1:1270470357958262904>, we‚Äôd like you to help us make **calls** ‚òéÔ∏è!

In addition to texting, calling voters in swing states is a **top priority** so close to the election, and its the best way to make a difference unless you live in / can commute to a swing state.

We set a goal for phone calls today. We‚Äôre 300,000 calls behind that goal, and today is a particularly vital day to our efforts. Why? 

# Early voting starts today in Wisconsin!


We‚Äôre only 14 days away from the election, and we need to try and shatter turnout records for <:KamalaTanSuit:1275479319640150146> + <:WalzSmile:1270424129853456445> !!

I was approved to text by mods days ago. I already have an existing Spoke account and I see the new environments for this org's campaigns without issue.  When I click one of the texting links in our texting-campaigns channel it adds it to my dashboard successfully, but no matter what the ""send first texts"" button remains greyed out. Refreshing or clearing cache does not help and it does this across multiple different types of campaigns posted in that channel the last few days.. haven't had a single one that didn't do this for me. It's been doing this for days regardless of whether it's a Pink, Blue, etc campaign. I am for now just going to keep textbanking with DSCC instead because this is a real roadblock. Thank you"
