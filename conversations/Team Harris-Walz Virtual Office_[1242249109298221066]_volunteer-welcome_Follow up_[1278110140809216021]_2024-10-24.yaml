  content: Sure! I get that, totally <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>  If you want
    to help run our Zoom phonebanks, I think that VOTE Team Chat Captain might be
    a good fit. That job is essentially hyping folks up, posting the links and other
    information needed to run the phone bank, and answering general questions. Would
    you like me to grab you the link for that training?

  content: Oh! We have a sub-section of the Online Engagement team that works with
    the community notes on Twitter to counter the *abundance* of misinformation there.
    That might be a good fit and is something you can do more on your own time!

    can tag in someone who knows more about that if it sounds like that might be more
    your speed.

  content: 'Of course! You can click as many of those emojis as you want to. Most
    of us volunteer in multiple areas and you''re welcome to participate in whichever
    areas work best for you.

    Since you signed up to connect with your online community, I would encourage you
    to take the training for that as soon as you can:

    Part 1: https://events.democrats.org/event/615101/

    Part 2: https://events.democrats.org/event/647793/


    We also have a weekly online messaging briefing on Tuesdays, which you can sign
    up for here: https://events.democrats.org/event/616415/


    As always, I and the rest of the mod team are here to help if you need anything!
