Content: Not sure if it’s been answered already, but is HQ working on setting up a “VP Debate watch party” event so we can start signing up? I haven’t seen anything on mobilize yet, apart from in-person watch parties. Or can we expect the debate to be live-streamed in “The Stage” channel again?

Thanks in advance!

Content: Hi <@682653283252437001> plans aren't solidfied yet. Assuming it is like the Presidential debate and the Convention, it will be streamed here on the Stage, and you can join all of us in a virtual watch party.
