What amazes me is that the ads are being broadcast to NY/NJ/CT, which are surely 'blue' states.  Are there TV ads going out to swing states too?  If so, great.  I think it shows the resources the campaign has, and seeing them during the Olympics is perfect timing."

I had a MASSIVE issue last night with the LGBTQIA+ liaison for atlantic county. I reached out to them to volunteer and use my platform to get canadites infront of the online space (twitch streamer) and the first conversation with everyone went great. Then the liaison jumped in and was just absolutely unresponsive to the suggestions and explaintions I was giving about attracting more members. It ended with her telling me I was making fun of her and her ""boomer"" (her wods not mine) friends and that I dont care about the same things she does and I need to stop judging her. When the last email i sent was about how much i care about getting regulations into nursing homes and end of life care facilies. How much I talk about Alzhiemers and the funding for it. So i just feel really insulted and Bob was in the convo (chair down here) and he hasnt said anything and neither has anyone else so im kinda just assming that the DNC wants nothing to do with me"

Or i wanted to stream the grand opening of a new HQ but thats tomorrow and I still havent heard anything
I also wanted to interview the super delegate because i have no idea how that process works, and if i dont my followers sure dont, so i want those processes explained
and i did connect with the LGBTQ+ liaison but after explaining why i was reaching out and how i can help, she told me people only wanted a social club and until the youth show up we have no idea what they can offer. So i really didnt want to contune talking to someone that thought so little of younger voters.

and they wanted me to stream the opening of the HQ, in person, and meet the super delegate there, in person.
a decent amount of my community is NJ local, or texas for some reason lol. but they never mentioned i would need creditials to do anything local
to be fair they didnt really mention anything other than how they cant get people to join the caucus and then telling me i was judging them.
also, this isnt a judgement on anyone, but like, i wish i knew about these things before now. I only found out about the discord because someone on tumblr mentioned it because i talked about my problem on there. The liaison even expressed that we dont probably vote for the same reasons as she's a senior citizen. And i did express that I talk about better nursing home and end of life care facility regulations. More funding and science for Alzhiemers. Reducing the deffense budget to help veterans. these are things i activily use my platform for and to be told I dont care about the same things as her was just frankly insulting. She mentioned that they would like me to help get more volunteers to join, but then started talking about how no one wants to show up because its not a social club or a bar. I recommened that maybe a gay night at a local club hosted by the caucus might be a really good idea. Especially if the canidate was there. Like in parks and rec. people love that level of connection."

So we are out canvassing today and something really weird is going on in our township. 

I don‚Äôt know who got to these folks but we have been finding, over and over again today, self-identified South Asian families here repeating this same bizarre not logical line (a talking point spoon fed to them somehow??) that VP Harris is ‚Äúfocusing too much on her blackness,‚Äù therefore they are voting Dem locally but will be voting Republican nationally.

üò≥

Lemme get this straight, they say she isn‚Äôt focusing enough on being South Asian‚Ä¶ sooooo let‚Äôs vote for *the guy who hates South Asians*????

Doing our best to steer them back on track. But also wow üò®

She lives overseas, but always kept in touch with local (Bergen County) issues. She related to me how she watched the local Republicans repeatedly use a 'playbook', so to speak -- i.e. the precise same thing as Gov. Walz describes in his  video about Project 2025 -- it is indeed a playbook. Just at a local, not national scale.

My sister said to me that she witnessed multiple local Republicans all repeat the precise same talking points on various local issues, on multiple occasions, in order to dominate the discussion. Republicans seem (?) better at this type of coordination.

It is only logical once thought over - of course local playbooks have been created all over the map, by both 'sides' (understand that I am a fierce Independent; we tend to field our own small teams ü´† Not this time though... üòê)

I have also only recently returned to NJ, having spent years in the wilds of Pennsylvania, surrounded by Trump supporters. By virtue of my precarious balance in the middle, and by evil happenstance, most of my friends are now ex or, at best, friends at an extreme distance. I have personally witnessed the most unbelievable issues (!) be brought forth as a 'reasonable' topic for conversation. Over and over and over again. Ad nauseum, until the friendships would dissolve into a gooey cult 'ghoulash soup'. (sic)

What I mean to say by all this is that they have a weapon in their 'arsenal' that we cannot really match. You might imagine that I say that with distress, when in actuality I say it with a concerned form of relief. Because it is the Republican base's willingness to embrace insanity, in order to 'win'.

In my view confronting the insanity directly is completely pointless-- they will simply sidestep the issue even in their own minds. Our father was a psychologist until he switched to mathematics. He would have had a field day studying all this. :/"

There is no trying to show one side more than the other. Like another responder said colorism is real. And they‚Äôre doing the same playbook in other areas against Harris. In Jewish areas they‚Äôre saying she‚Äôs antisemitic and pro Palestine. In Muslim areas like in Dearborn Michigan they‚Äôre saying she‚Äôs anti Palestine and Gaza and saying she‚Äôs pro Zionist. It‚Äôs part of the same tactics. Thank you for being on the ground and helping. I wish I could do more.
