Content: We left 2 seats with no dem running, just gave them away! And the guy running in CD 13 filed an hour before closing so that it wouldn't be 3Rs unopposed for congress. I understand that gerrymandering is not fair, but I really have a hard time with some of these folks abandoning their districts.

Content: A friend of mine here in the NC Triangle area has organized a bunch of us as "Tarot Readers for Harris-Walz." My colleagues and I are offering 3-card Tarot readings for proof of a $35 donation. I've been reading the cards for over 50 years, including 2 decades as a full-time professional. And my colleagues are some of the VERY biggest names in the community. https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61565262053189

Content: I love the Blue Dot trend started in Nebraska. It is a conversation starter. We need to get that going here in NC too I think! I live in a conservative, kinda rural area and not many are comfortable putting Harris or Stein signs out.

Content: Good Morning North Carolina friends!  Im very sorry about your lieutenant governor, so I thought id share some important info as you can request a no excuse absentee ballot RIGHT NOW!!  The first like will lead you to general information regarding deadlines, the second link is where you can request a mail in ballot, and the third link will provide you county specific information.  The more mail in ballots, the easier it will be on election day!!  And if you have any qustions, Id be more than happy to help!  Dont delay, make a plan today!!  https://www.vote411.org/ https://votebymail.ncsbe.gov/app/home https://vt.ncsbe.gov/BOEInfo/

Content: Hey y'all - it's been a second since I popped over here to introduce myself - I run the NC Coordinated Campaign Discord (read: the state-specific one). If you're willing to take on two Discords, feel free to shoot me a DM for the link (it seems I've been warned for posting ours). We've got a #find-your-organizer channel to help you get plugged in locally. You can also always @ me if you've got questions about getting involved here in NC!

Content: I'm a CA resident that is interested in moving to NC for the final month of the campaign to help organize. I can pay my own way to get to wherever I will be most helpful to the campaign, but I was hoping there might be another volunteer or member of the campaign that has a spare room that I could stay at while I volunteer. Please let me know (in DMs) if anyone can help connect me with the right person!

Content: They sure are. I didn’t realize this until some canvassers knocked on my door. I’ve since gone out to canvas with the group. I’d vote down the ticket anyway. AND the proposed change to potentially further limit voting rights with a NC State constitutional amendment wording change. Need to vote NO on this. I’ve only been in NC for 4 years ( moved from nyc) and it is still very much a backward state in so many ways outside of Raleigh, Charlotte and Asheville.

Content: Hi <@1270562171050266725> we can’t have fundraising sites linked in here directly, but I think letting people know that the state has set up a direct link for support and that people can Google it or look on the North Carolina.gov site for more info would be great!

Content: Mod note: You can link state dot gov or org sites for voting info in state channels, regardless of donate button, because donation is not the purpose of the site.  However, we mods will comment that DNC officially approved voting info site is www.iwillvote dot com. I think the above item was moved from general to state, which is fine.  We are certainly sensitive to NC disaster relief.

Content: Hi guys - Renee here from Boone.  Helene has made the importance of who wins in 2024 1000x more clear. Imagine if Robinson rather than Cooper were governor? Or Trump rather than Biden? The high country is moving forward because there are more things that unite us than divide us! Because we are focused on the future and solving problems, not blaming others. My family is safe, but others are hurting.  We need to redouble our efforts so that we are led into the future by capable, honorable leaders.

Content: Regarding Helene and the election. There is a lot of misinformation and disinformation saying that Gov Cooper and the Biden Administration is ignoring W NC and people are dying. Dead bodies are piling up.
Mark Robinson is using his own money and resources to help people because Gov Cooper and Biden/Harris are doing nothing
You cannot downplay the efforts to politicize this disaster

Content: I have been disappointed by the appearance of Trump signs in Charlotte so I made myself a promise: each week I will donate $1 for every Trump sign I see to Kamala’s campaign. Same for the Robinson and Bishop signs.

Content: Hi,

I’m at the Rowan County Democrats office and we are out of signs that only say “Harris Walz” in big font. The county chairs placed a big order so we were expecting 300 signs at this office a few days ago as they are in high demand and there is a big breakfast tomorrow morning.

Is there anywhere in the state between Charlotte or Winston-Salem where I can pick up a large amount of those signs by early tomorrow morning?

Content: As a Black leader, you have the unique opportunity to serve your community by encouraging them to register and vote for candidates who are most likely to work for changes in our state and country that will make a real difference in Black lives. 
In North Carolina, these could be things like:
•    Provide better work protections for construction, maintenance and landscape workers.
•    Require guns in homes to be under lock and key.
•    Provide a tax cut for working families with a state earned income tax credit
•    Increase rural access to medical, dental and mental health services.
History shows that Republicans are unlikely to support such things.
In the United States, it could be things like:
•    Increase funding to detect, research and combat sickle cell disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, and other health issues that disproportionately affect Blacks.
•    Provide forgivable loans for disadvantaged people to start businesses.
•    Expand forgiving education loans for teaching, public service and healthcare jobs.
History shows that Republicans are unlikely to support such things.
GETTING EVERYONE TO VOTE IS ESSENTIAL – Key voting information:
•    Voter ID required to vote
•    Registering/early voting – You can still register and vote at the same time in person during early voting: 10/17 – 11/2. Find out where/when: https://vt.ncsbe.gov/EVSite/
•    Voting by mail: 10/29 is the last day to request an absentee ballot. 
•    Election Day is 11/5: 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM
PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE YOU KNOW AND ASK THEM TO DO THE SAME.
THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR ANY AND ALL EFFORTS.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!

Content: Hi Jack, I know Kamala was just there, but a friend told me Greenville, NC is energetic for Trump’s rally today and has been seeing more mail, texts, calls and general attention for Trump. They were given off work to go to the rally. Do we have targeted ads there regarding lower costs of groceries, Gen Z/ECU kids, rural/religious voters, Medicare expansion… also a big nursing/healthcare program there but some people were anti-mask during covid. Pitt Co. is important for Eastern NC.

Content: Okay. They must be being bombarded with Trump junk mail (who wants that?) but at the same time it’s coming across as very visible.

Content: Hey folks! Thank you for joining us. **Together, we will write the next chapter in the greatest story ever told.**

Phonebanking is our **number one priority** so close to the election, and it’s a phenomenal way to get started. We often set goals for specific numbers, like how we set a goal for 5 million calls this past weekend. We made 4.6 million, reaching immense numbers of people!

We’re 300,000 calls behind our goal for the day, and we urgently need to call Wisconsin voters. Early voting starts today in Wisconsin, and people need voting plans! We’re only **14 days away** from the election!

[Can we count on you to help us? Please, click here to get started and call directly into Wisconsin!](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=32641249-daa7-4253-b97b-df11f362bdb3&ref=go_kh_calls_wi&utm_source=hfp_w_go_calls_20241022&utm_campaign=hfp_w_go_mb_do_vol_vrec_calls_20241022&utm_medium=go_kh_calls_20241022&utm_term=go_kh_calls_20241022)

We know it’s scary for many of you. I have the same anxiety as well. But a second trump administration is much scarier. We can do this!
