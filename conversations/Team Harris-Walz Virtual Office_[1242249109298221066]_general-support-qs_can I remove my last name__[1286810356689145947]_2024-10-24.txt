Content: I just got onboarded for texting and I was told to use my first and last name [with state in brackets]. Is it ok if I remove my last name or just keep an initial? Will this impact my Scale to Win account, which has my full name? I noticed many people on here including mods only have their last initial, so I hope it's ok if I do so too. Many thanks in advance!!

Content: You don't need to remove your scale to win name. You can change your name to firstname last intial though.

Content: It will still be connected. Scale to win doesn't connect with discord in anyway.
