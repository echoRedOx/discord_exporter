  content: Hello <@1276944224985550960> sharing printed handouts of talking points
    is a fantastic idea. We have loads of material from trusted sources that you can
    printout and pass along to folks. You can find this in the Reach app library where
    you can use the Search function to get content for specific topics.

  content: I hope this is a correct thread to post this.  I just saw a great thread
    here called "supporter content"  I assume that is for us to share on social media
    correct? I would like to share some that are in that thread on twitter.  How do
    I share it right from Discord to twitter?  Thanks.  (also if I have to go to the
    Reach app to share it, how would I find this content & also Reach app always freezes
    on my phone so it's hard to use).
