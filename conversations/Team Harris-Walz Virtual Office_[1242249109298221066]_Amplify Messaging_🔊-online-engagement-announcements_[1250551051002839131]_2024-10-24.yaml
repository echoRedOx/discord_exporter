    \nToday, our theme is **Trump\u2019s America 2025: Repeal Health Care, Gut Retirement\
    \ Security**\n\n\U0001F4A0 Today, let your community know Trump wants to repeal\
    \ health care and gut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid if reelected. \n\
    \n\U0001F4A0 Key message: \nUnder Joe Biden\u2019s leadership, more Americans\
    \ have health insurance than under any president. He strengthened the Affordable\
    \ Care Act to lower premiums and expand access to affordable care. He took on\
    \ Big Pharma and won \u2013 lowering prescription drug costs and capping the price\
    \ of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare. Donald Trump was one vote\
    \ away from repealing the ACA in his first term and said he will \u201Cterminate\u201D\
    \ the law if reelected. \n\nJoe Biden is also protecting Social Security, Medicare,\
    \ and Medicaid from extreme MAGA attacks. Donald Trump is proposing cuts to Social\
    \ Security and Medicare while giving tax handouts to his super rich friends. He\
    \ has also called for privatizing Social Security, which he called a \u201CPonzi\
    \ scheme.\u201D \n\n\U0001F53D **Content to share:**\U0001F53D \nToolkit: https://joe.link/RNCToolkit\n\
