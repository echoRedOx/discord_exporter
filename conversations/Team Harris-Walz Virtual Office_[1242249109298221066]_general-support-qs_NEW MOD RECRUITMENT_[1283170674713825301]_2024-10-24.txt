Content: Hi Frances. I'm trying to find out about next steps for being a Text Moderator. I was one in 2020. I took the training for it for this year and filled out required forms, etc. But I am not sure where to keep an eye out for next steps. Can you help? (I posted about this in text-team-welcome but it seems to have been removed?) Thanks!

Content: I have extensive experience in running call centers, customer service and inside sales teams. How could I support as a moderator or helper? I would love to be able to help share guidance and tips to my fellow call bank team members -  however I am not too skilled with Discord. Thank you!

Content: Hi Terry--sounds like you would be a good fit for the call moderator team. I would recommend going to <#1242256751445934262> and inquiring with those mods as to the process!

Content: I don't have formal mod experience but have also ran a call center in my professional life. I have also managed a policy/procedure queue at my company - if employees had issues or didn't know how to proceed with a customer, or figure out if something was within the company policy  they'd reach out to me. Either by direct phone calls,  email, or an automated issue management queue. My responsibility was managing all 3 all day, full time 🙂 I signed up for the text mod training for Saturday, but happy to help where most needed if any area needs mods more than others.

Content: I may as well send it here as well; so all of the available slots for the shadow shifts either have a bit that says “name here” or one that says “unavailable for shadowing,” are the later ones not open slots and we can’t select them? As in they’re literally unavailable time slots and we have to select the former? Or are we allowed to select the latter as well?

Content: Interested in being a server mod. I have call center job experience, as well as web design and supervisor de-escalation positions. I have been a super volunteer for other campaigns (Bernie 2016). Done phone banking for this campaign and waiting on verification to start texting.
