Thanks for the question. While I don't have that answer for you as we're focused on Online Engagement here, one of our <@&1245831457818279986>s may be able to assist you with an answer. (You can usually reach them through <#1242249109298221069> or <#1267941954243526756>.) In my experience shopping there, some sold out material did eventually return while other pieces did NOT."

However, I've noticed that some items now are sold out or noted as not available until a certain date. Was your item one of those that ships later perhaps?

They have various shipping dates for different items and many don't ship until September. Depends on the items. They likely do this to produce larger runs so the campaign gets to keep more money for campaigning rather than product. You might check the receipt and/or item/s on the website to see if it lists the shipping date/s. They often do."

I know the DNC uses it for the stuff they sell on the party's website since I have the donkey coffee cup from that.

I donâ€™t see any shipping dates on the confirmation receipt. I can definitely understand that theyâ€™ve been flooded with orders!

Iâ€™m not complaining. Just wondering if anyone else received their orders!

Check back periodically. Also, if you get the Shop app on your phone, you can probably get notifications that way too because that's how I got a lot of notifications on DNC gear I ordered a few times."

I understand- there is so much excitement about this campaign. I didnâ€™t follow Fetterman as much (Iâ€™m in California.) Thank you for the response!
