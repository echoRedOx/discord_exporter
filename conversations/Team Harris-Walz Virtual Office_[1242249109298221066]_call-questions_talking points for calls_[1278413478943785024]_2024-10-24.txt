Content: Hi there, would it be possible to get updated talking points specifically for the economic policies that VP Harris has rolled out? I had a couple of undecided callers ask about grocery and gas prices and would like to be able to answer that question more eloquently. Thank you!!

Content: <@1271472141119787206> if you are currently active in the Zoom, please feel free to ask for more information in the chat. The data captains and chat captains there will be the most helpful for the specific calls you are making

Content: Yes I saw the economy talking points on the right side but since the campaign rolled out some new economic plans I think it would be helpful to have a few points on that to read in advance (instead of seeking support while Iâ€™m on a call with a voter).  Thanks so much for checking!!
