Unfortunately we cannot share the slide decks, with exception of the online community map. This is your playbook now. 

Have a look in Reach (details at <#1242256950402744431> ), <#1250876565366243348> and on SoSha (https://share.kamalaharris.com/toolkit/4d3e9996-8c34-40f1-abb5-2ebbdfc5dd57) to find content you want to engage your communities with. So, whichever community you are in, try to provide the right information to them, when appropriate. Let me know if you have other questions. Thanks for being on board!"
