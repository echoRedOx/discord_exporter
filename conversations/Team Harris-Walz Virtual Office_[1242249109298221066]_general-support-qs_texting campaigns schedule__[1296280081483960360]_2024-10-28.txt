Content: when I did texting in 2020 I seemed to be busy all the time and sent thousands of texts. This time I rarely see the announcements in time to get into a campaign. this might be obvious, but any hints on how to know when to check, or where something like a schedule is posted? Thnak you!

Content: Hi <@1289715686498631763> so glad to have you. I think part of it is the number of volunteers???? Keep the discord open and as soon as there is announcement- JUMP. good problem to have right?
