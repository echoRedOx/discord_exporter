This is the link that I was given:

Stephen Bronskill (Harris for President): ðŸ“žJoin todayâ€™s 9pm ET Phone Bank shift: https://democrats.zoom.us/j/95357918984?pwd=gGpGUPc6ZpbB8A7XyhrsQMSswpF2eq.1

Would someone please tell me where I can find a link that will let me join? Thank you!"

You do have to create a Zoom Workplace account and log into it to get into the Zoom Phone Bank. The Zoom Workplace account is free.
