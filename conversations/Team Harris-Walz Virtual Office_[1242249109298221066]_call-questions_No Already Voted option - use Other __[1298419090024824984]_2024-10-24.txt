Content: Calling all tiers_102224_MI_ET_type: dvc list in ScaleToWin, we don't have  an Already Voted option. Would love to have that. Until it arrives, should we use Other?

Content: Hi David. If Already Voted isn't on there, use other. The campaign pulls voter info each night and adjusts the lists accordingly, so if they did vote, they should drop off the list within a couple of days.
