  content: Hi! Thanks so much for volunteering with us. We appreciate the question.
    A lot of work has been happening behind the scenes to transition the campaign
    to Harris. You should see NEW videos and graphics in appropriate places within
    Reach to use. Staff will continue to update Reach and revisit the content.

  content: New content is created every day for the campaign by staff as well as by
    volunteer editors and graphic artists. It is what fills Reach. Older Biden content
    may not necessarily be "updated" as you mention, since the teams are generally
    focusing on the current situation in the new Harris campaign. I encourage you
    to view the newest volunteer created content (before it even hits Reach sometimes)
    right here in Discord at <#1250876565366243348>. In addition, you can see the
    very latest from the campaign accounts on social at <#1252676126698897429>. Yes,
    please use Reach. I strongly suggest focusing on the newest additions however.
    Thanks again for joining us!

  content: Thanks, do you ever take suggestions. One thing for my family is border
    and fentanyl. My nephew was addicted and thankfully sober now but showing that
    messages would be impactful for them bc trump just lies and stops progress and
    Kamala is making real impact and I need tools to show them
