  content: "Hi there. Is there a kudos channel? I have been online since 1992, volunteering\
    \ online at election time since 2000. This is the best organized I\u2019ve ever\
    \ seen the party, and it\u2019s the most aligned with my values it\u2019s ever\
    \ been (so glad we\u2019re not playing Lucyball anymore). \n\nAnyway, just got\
    \ an email from Frances H encouraging me to phone bank again (I will just have\
    \ to time it right from Berlin). It\u2019s this personalization (name) plus automation\
    \ (really nice templates can someone tell the dccc to use the same designer and\
    \ lose their gaudy harangues?) that had me want to give kudos. \n\nWhat a great\
    \ team and infrastructure. And candidate."
