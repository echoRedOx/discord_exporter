  content: "Right after I get emailed the details for events I\u2019ve signed up for,\
    \ I save them to my phone\u2019s reminders app (or calendar if you prefer). That\
    \ way you create a concise \u201Cone stop shop\u201D and can avoid all the back\
    \ and forth between browser, inbox, texts\u2026 just thought I\u2019d share since\
    \ it\u2019s one less thing to worry about when scheduling for more events. Also\
    \ helps me avoid double booking by accident or messing up the time zones. <:bidenpointq:1251648410902069351>\
