  content: Hello - my hairdresser is Iranian, connect to many other Iranian Americans.  It
    is hard to get her to focus on politics but I try every election cycle.  She has
    said about 1/2 her Iranian American friends and family are for Trump and 1/2 for
    Harris.  Anyone know of an Iranian American for Kamala group with a website or
    social media site I can direct her to?  On Mobilize I found a DNC event Iranian
    Americans 4 Kamala phone banking but no link to a group.  I need something I can
    share with her that details why Harris will be better for Iranian American concerns
    than Trump.  Ideas, suggestions.  If there is a different channel I should ask
    this in, please let me know.  Thank you.

  content: Hey Joan - I am an Iranian American. I host a (virtual) phonebank on Monday
    nights 6-8 PST. I speak Farsi fluently if they want help in another language.
    Also, depending on where they are there are opportunities to put their language
    skills to use in person.
