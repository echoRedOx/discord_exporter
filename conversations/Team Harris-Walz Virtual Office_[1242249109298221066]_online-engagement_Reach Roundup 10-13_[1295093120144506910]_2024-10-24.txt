Content: i've been really engaged with getting "RepubliCON," which is my personal word for the tRUMPsters, to get them to choose NOT to Vote for tRUMP, which hasn't been easy, but i've been able to pick away at particular downballot candidates in their area, as well as tRUMP, due, partly, in fact, to the way i spell his name!  ðŸ˜‰

Content: I don't know how to explain what I'm doing/have been doing. Maybe something similar to Ghost Marketing Strategy?

My reach is miniscule (for long story reasons), but I do have above-average pattern recognition and can combine this with professional experience growing audiences. I watch. I do a vibe check. Then drop in with an insight or add one with/to approved content to maximize my impact.

Sorta kinda how I mod? ðŸ˜… 

So it isn't any one thing. It is at the intersections of many where I quietly boost, amplify, and/or push back against what I am noticing in the gaps.

Content: Many voters I spoke with did not want to tell me who they were voting for, mostly women, but there was no good option to enter that. I usally entered "other" but it then made the conversation disjointed, because I couln'dt really go on to a good script. I accepted their privacy without hestitation, and jumped to asking if they needed help with polling locations, etc. It would be useful to have an option to input, "unwilling to disclose." I suspect they were Kamala voters because they almost always stuck with the call.
