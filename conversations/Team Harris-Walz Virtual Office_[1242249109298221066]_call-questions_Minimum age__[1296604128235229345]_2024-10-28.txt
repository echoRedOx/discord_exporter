Content: Is there a minimum age one needs to be for phone banking? I have heard of kids as young as 10 doing it with a parent, but to up via Mobilize by themselves I'd think it would be 13. Thoughts? I am answering the organizing emails and it came up.

Content: There isn't a minimum that I'm aware of.  I did hear about a 10 year old and I had a 16 year old on the other night.
