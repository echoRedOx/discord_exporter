  content: Hello mods. I did the thing on Reach where you search for a person's name
    and you tag who they support, what issues matter to them, etc. I entered my girlfriend's
    name as a test. She has never signed up to volunteer and has never donated. She
    now got a text from the campaign today, about 2 months later. Is this info collected
    used for text banking? Or just unrelated and somehow she just got signed up ?

    and it was reiterated that they are not collecting this info- so that was coincidental

  content: Wow, very very coincidental. I have no idea how else they would have gotten
    her name and info.

    if she's friends with you I'm assuming she's registered to vote?

  content: It's also how we will be able to whittle down lists as people vote and
    those votes are counted. Apparently they can pull the data daily and are updating
    accordingly (this is now mixing info I've gotten from phone bank trainings with
    the Reach team training, but there you have it)
