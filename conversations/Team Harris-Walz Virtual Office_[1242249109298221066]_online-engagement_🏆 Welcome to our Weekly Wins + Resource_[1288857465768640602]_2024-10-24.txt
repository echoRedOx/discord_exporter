Content: I've committed to wearing one of my campaign hats for Kamala and Tim each day, and in the past several weeks there's only been one person who has said go Trump. anyone else who makes a comment is so excited and thrilled for Kamala and Tim. There's this shared enthusiasm, like we're all on one team working together. I'm amazed how many people stop to chat!

Content: One of the members of one of the discords I am in had a father who has been MAGA up til now. I wish I could say it was something I helped with but what made him change his mind was receiving a Trump email asking him to come hold a sign for 15 min, for $10.  I asked him if he would see if he could provide a copy with no identifying marks, for people to use, in the hopes of changing more minds. I will post here if I get it. But just the news is great. Let‚Äôs hope there are more reactions like this one and that T‚Äôs campaign keeps sending these emails to his supporters. I do love when these people do themselves in.

Content: I've been phone banking for several weeks and am starting to get in the groove of how to talk to people. Multiple red and undecided listening to what's being said as answers to questions being posed versus the mean blue answers coming out on news and media.

Content: I would love some advice on how to find possibly undecided voters or potentially persuadable Trumpy voters on Threads and X. My algorithms are feeding me all blue voters for the most part. X is filled with so many trolls in the comments of any posts from right-wing news accounts that it's hard to know where to bother engaging. Do we have any data on the value of engaging on X at all?

That said, I've had some good conversations with a couple of blue voters who were posting cynical takes. I point out the need for encouraging engagement through positivity and a spirit of unity, and that's been resonating. I've also been wearing down a couple of intelligent evangelical friends on FB who don't like Trump but have been lied to about Kamala. It's amazing how effective one can be when acknowledging people's concerns rather than judging and arguing!

Sincerely pro-life people are worried about the "unintended consequences" of the harsher abortion restrictions, and it's easy to change people's minds about economics if they're not completely absorbed into the cult.

Content: I‚Äôve been sharing content from Reach and before that Greenfly. What I have noticed lately is that I‚Äôm getting huge engagement from resharing KamalaHQ content on X and major engagement when I have a supportive reply to a KamalaHQ X content. Not just likes but retweets and quote tweets. As a result I have really picked up my social engagement there. A recent example is this one https://x.com/jeffstrater/status/1838655307670786296?s=46&t=znOaFPGmzhQaTWqmjMRSSA

Content: Our grassroots group will meet tomorrow to address more post cards & get updates on our registration of students at our local university. Several of our members are involved with their sororities. The entire state has challenged all universities to have a registration drive, so exciting to see the involved of Gen Z!

Content: I don't know if this will get through or if helpful but "they" have brought up old story of when Kamala  as prosecutor let police officers murderer go free. It is totally out of context. She just didn't go with the death penalty, guy got 3 life sentences, I think, not sure but doubt if paroled! She stuck w her ethics has hard as it was. She had real guts to stand on the right thing: our society needs to do more to help all people, then we can reduce crime.  
The 2nd thing, is the boarder.   Course, they bring up her failures BUT her new solutions rock!!  There was a woman explaining Kamala's boarder solutions on the radio, msnbc who is on her staff but I didn't get the name. She crushed it! That would make a good video for the undecided!!!!! Go Blue!

Content: I'm not sure the specific clip you mentioned, but I'd recommend doing your best to share content from Reach on immigration (https://app.reach.vote/library/label/4a993de8-dd03-4693-8a04-8d61fe76012d?campaign=democrats) and share facts from her issues page regarding her immigration policy (https://kamalaharris.com/issues/).

I found the woman speaking about Kamala and the boarder, it is Jasmine Crockett. Link below. This info needs to be shared. She is brilliant.
