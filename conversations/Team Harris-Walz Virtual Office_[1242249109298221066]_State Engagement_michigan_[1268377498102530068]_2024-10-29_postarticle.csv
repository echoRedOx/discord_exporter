I suggest focusing on the close U.S. House races we need to win to regain the House: District 07 [several counties near Lansing] is the one Elissa Slotkin is leaving for her Senate run.   Here is a sign up for door knocking in that district    https://www.mobilize.us/onecampaignformichigan/event/632227/    District 08 [Bay City area] is open because Dan Kildee is retiring. District 10 [just north of Detroit] is where Dem Carl Marlinga is running. With the Michigan One Campaign, you will be able to work simultaneously for state, House, Senate & Presidential races.

You guys have been very helpful so far. I am coming to Michigan to volunteer from the 22-27 and still having a hard time figuring out where I can be most useful door knocking. I'm thinking of District 07 and wondering if anyone knows if there is a campaign office that I can go to get my walking lists?  I only see one time slot from 5-7 on Wednesday to help Hertel or a big Campaign for Michigan office in Lansing or around there.  I'd really like a home base campaign office since I'll be there for multiple days.  I realize that might be such a 2016 thought since it seems like the campaigns are set up differently now.  Also since I'm looking for ways to help during the day on weekdays, there doesn't seem to be as much set up."

It was great to be out there talking to people. It was hard to get plugged in, but once I did I was put to work. Thanks to the offices in Saginaw, Southfield, Detroit (Livernois) and Ann Arbor! If anyone wants advice of where to go, reach out. Lets do this!"
