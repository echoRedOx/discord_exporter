It may just be too early as you're guessing. Which training is it <@860347807843352598>? Happy to try to help you.

Good. I'm going to send you some more tips in case it happens again. Thanks for being with us! Here are a few best practices to help you out: 
 1) Check your wifi or internet connection. 
 2) If you cannot find the details for your event, check your e-mails or log into the Mobilize website (https://events.democrats.org/) and check your schedule in the menu (top right corner). 
 3) If neither of those work, I recommend submitting a ticket to <#1259167462956597269> and one of our team members will help you get it sorted out!"""
