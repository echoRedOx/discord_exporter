Participants who already went through training were given a five question pop quiz and a new form to complete.

Following that, an unknown number of participants were removed from text team access, including myself.

It’s been days and still no news on what’s next, just silence. It is a significant speed bump and is demoralizing and dispiriting besides, especially for the more neurospicy amongst us or folks who are simply not good quiz/test takers. 

This gatekeeping needs to be addressed or we risk losing many good folks unnecessarily and needlessly."
