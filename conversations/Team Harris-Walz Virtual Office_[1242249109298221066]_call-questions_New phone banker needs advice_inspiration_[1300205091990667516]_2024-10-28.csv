What do you wish you knew when you started?  I feel like others could do this so much better than I am doing it. Don't want to stop, but would love tips on scripts/engagement/etc. Are there any sample calls to look at anywhere?"

Makes it WAY less awkward

I've asked folx if they love all the awkward political calls as much as I love making them and a lot of people will soften up after that

The best advice I can give is to make the script your own, don't try to read it verbatim. Ask questions, let the voters express themselves, and tell them why you're supporting Harris.  As you make more calls, the more comfortable you'll become."

Success looks like helping people make a plan to vote, and giving people more information about Harris. You don't have to argue with Maga or rude people. Just tell them you have another call and say good night!"

In fact, it's probably better if it's *not* perfect. Our opponents have plenty of machines and bots at work for them: we have people, and it's that human touch that really convinces people. Remember, a lot of people are feeling much more... *isolated* from actual connection to other citizens because of the current media environment. So many things are curated or summarized or depersonalized in one way or another.

On top of all of this, this is a pure numbers game. The more calls we get out, the more people we reach, the more likely it is we reach some of the few undecided voters out there, or some of the disaffected, exhausted dems out there. Your calls are calls that wouldn't have been made were it not for your effort! So tap into your courage and dive in!"
