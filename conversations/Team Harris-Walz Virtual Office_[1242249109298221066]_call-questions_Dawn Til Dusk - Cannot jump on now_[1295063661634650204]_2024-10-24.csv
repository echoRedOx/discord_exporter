I just selected Make Calls Now and nothing happened. I was able to schedule a time for later (one hr from now). Do I really need to wait?

There was a glitch with the Mobilize system, but I think it is fixed now, though it may take a minute to connect you.  Please give it a try and come back if it doesn't work."
