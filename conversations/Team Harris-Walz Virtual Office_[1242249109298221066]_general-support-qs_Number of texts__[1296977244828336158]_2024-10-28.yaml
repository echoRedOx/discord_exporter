  content: how can I find out in Discord or Spoke how many texts I've sent since I
    started volunteering? I'm working on multiple campaigns in Discord/Spoke and would
    love to have a sense of how many texts I've sent, replies I've fielded, etc. -
    where do I find that out? I think it will help me to know how much I've worked
    in certain states when the results start coming in... Thank you!

    they'll be able to share that info, but the text team will see it and be able
    to respond to it! Thanks.
