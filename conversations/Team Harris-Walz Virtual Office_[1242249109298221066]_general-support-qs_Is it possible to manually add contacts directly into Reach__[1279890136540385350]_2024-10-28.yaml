  content: I hope this is the right place to ask. I'm finding Reach very difficult.
    I put in a friend complete with address and I get back 33 matches, none of which
    are in the state I entered. Is there a way for me to manually enter new contacts
    and their survey results, etc.?

  content: Hi <@816713323272732704> have you tried putting less information in the
    Reach search? I put just your name and MA, only one person popped up, I'm pretty
    sure it's you. Try your friend's name and their zip code. See that helps

  content: Thanks. I take it there is no way to just enter a new contact from scratch
    without Reach finding it. Oh well. Thanks again.
