Content: Do we have the capability to have specific people call specific voter demographics?  Say like, someone with a background in middle eastern affairs calling democrats who say gaza is their top concern

Content: At this time, we do not have the capacity to target calls that specifically.  At https://events.democrats.org/ you may apply a variety of filters to available opportunities and determine which is right for you.  I will ask for more ideas in our moderator channel and leave this discussion open for more input. Thank you for your talents and for making a difference in this election!
