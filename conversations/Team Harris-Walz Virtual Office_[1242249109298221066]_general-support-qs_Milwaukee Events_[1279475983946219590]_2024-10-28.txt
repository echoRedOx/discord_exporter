Content: I’m not really sure where to post this, but I travelled to Milwaukee for one event yesterday and two events today. The event yesterday was cancelled with little notice and the one at 6:00pm today was cancelled, as well, but I still received a text yesterday about whether I was planning to attend tonight. I was also told that I could attend canvassing today from 7:00-9:00am or 12:00-2:00pm, but evidently the 12:00-2:00pm was cancelled as well. I’m really trying to help this campaign, but it’s challenging when it’s that unorganized.

Content: Hi <@1277027382141653045> I appreciate your frustration and you must be feeling discouraged and let down by the campaign when you are doing so much to support it. The logistics for Harris/Walz campaign stops are last minute arrangements due to security concerns. Our virtual platform doesn't get this info either. 
The issues with canvassing should be shared with your local dems office. They are open today.

Content: Unfortunately it does seem that virtually all of the scheduled canvassing events were cancelled this weekend.
