Content: I don’t believe I have joined any groups. I have the second part of training tomorrow at two pm. The first two groups you mentioned sound pretty doable for me. I will have to try to find them. Do you know if the U is doing any activity for Harris? I guess I will find out soon. Summer goes by quickly. 🥺 kids will be back off to Uni soon

Content: Hi Zunny. Nice to meet you as well. How are things looking up there? Is Kelly Tschibaka running for anything up there this time around? I know she's (R) so you may not know. Just curious. I used to work for her and I know she ran against Lisa Murkowski last time around and lost.

Content: That is a loaded question you just asked. She is part of the problem. I think she is in the Valley. She is doing a podcast or show of sort with her husband. I am sure you can find it online. Project 2025 started here in Alaska long ago, as you must already be aware of, I am somewhat surprised to see you one this side of the aisle. I am quite perplexed actually.

Content: LOL I only said I worked for her. We were friends but I had to distance myself from her in 2020 when she started agreeing with the "stolen election" theory in 2020. And then when she was running for Senate and appeared with Trump...that was pretty much THE END. Even though I don't live there...I'm glad Murkowski won...even though she's (R) she seems very much in the middle and we're losing too many of middle (R)'s. I mean I'd rather it be (D) but if it can't be (D) it needs to at least be middle (R).

Content: I would call myself an independent. When I am voting, I tend to lean (D) but if there is an issue I'm particular about, I will look at all candidates for a specific race and go with the candidate that is closest to me. In other words, I'm true to country before party. That said, I have yet to vote for an (R) in a presidential or congressional race, but I have considered (R)'s in some local races where I have lived because in those instances the (D)'s running had some unusual positions. Hope that makes sense.

Content: That's interesting about Project 2025 starting there. I would have guessed it started in the south. 

Normally I would not get involved other than to donate money towards the cause....but Trump just CANNOT win this year....and it can't be close. It needs to be by a WIDE margin, especially in the swing states. People cannot sit home and not vote this time around and "hope for the best".

Content: Hi Alaskans, I am helping with debate related content in the AK official Facebook group.  I may put some of it here too.  What content would you want to see that relates specifically to Alaska?

Content: HI <@1268980664468771078> - Yes, I am in Texas, but I just started help Alaska (on FB and by extension here on Discord). I can definitely get you some resources.  One important note regarding down-ballot Dems or other grassroots orgs. Of course, we love them, but due to campaign finance rules, we have to avoid posting anything that involves fundraising or merch that is not for National Dems or Harris Walz directly. This includes state and local party stuff and state/local candidate stuff.

Content: Also, while I send you more statewide grassroots info privately.  (Check your DMs here on Discord),  I will include at least one Anchorage event that is also virtual.  This link is DNC approved, so it can be shared everywhere. https://events.democrats.org/event/654545/

Content: Well, I almost gave up looking in here anymore. I am glad I popped my head in this morning. Thank you Jay. I have been seeing your posts in Harris for Alaska. You wouldn't happen to be a translator would you? I have a local source I was told I could ask, but I thought I may ask you first. I had spoken to Robyn Niayuq Burke about some of the local issues that they had been experiencing and also had read about the DOJ being present because a language issues. I know its a long shoot but I thought I would ask. I just assumed that would not have an Inupiaq or Yup’ik translator here. She did suggest Yup'ik would be the best for translated content.

Content: <@1199911282623664181>  - Sorry for the delayed reply, and thanks for bringing up the language issue.  I am not a translator of indigenous languages. I will look into that. Since I already posted about the weekly phone banks,  here's another in person option for those in the Anchorage area. https://events.democrats.org/event/691992/

Content: <@1199911282623664181> wants to share this video post from Native Americans for Harris, an unofficial but affiliated group.  This post needs to stay in state channels or it can go in <#1268426751164551199>.  Also beware of some mild bad language in the video. Poster is a local Democrat who lives in Montana.  This is his Tik Tok Video. https://www.facebook.com/share/p/CStBSH7giZiZF8zi/

Content: We need to vote and put Trump and MAGA in the dumpster of history. After 20 years of military service I have never been ashamed of my service until Trump was elected. I watched January 6 in horror as most active duty service menber. Now we are here again and these people are still supporting this draft dodging coward.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!

Content: <@&1245910108685209640> Early voting has started in many of the swing states, so this weekend is CRITICAL to our GOTV efforts. It's also incredibly important that we make sure that people with mail in ballots have gotten their ballots and understand how to return them. This is such important work, and we have to close strong. But we can't make our 10 million call goal without your help. If you're experienced, you can go straight to our dialer [here ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=933f666e-c699-46e3-ac92-12d9cf6f3992) - if you're new, please join us over in <#1242256751445934262> to get connected to some training! (If you don't have that, go to  <id:customize>  and choose "talk to voters in key states.") Even making a few calls helps. Many hands make light work. Will you please come over and join us?
