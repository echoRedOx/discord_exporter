Content: Yes I also use it at work and it comes in most handy for route, repetitive tasks and just generally being an assistant (with a human having the final review and approval)

I think there are a lot of uses, even in political campaigns, for AI. Itâ€™s just that AI imagery in particular is an area I think it would be best to stay away from until the impacts of the technology are more clear.

Thats not to say no AI at all can be used in the creation process- Photoshop and Adobe products have a lot of great tools that use AI to empower the user to work more efficiently. But itâ€™s still in the hands of an actual human creator, not automatically generated.

Content: I know a professional artist who hAtEs AI, and had to uninstall a bunch of her adobe toolsets because her sales rep pushed the ai tools on her. I think we saw some push back re: ai the other day from someone who suspected an AI gen image came from one of our channels. I felt like we were all in the hotbox for a good second there.

Content: Yeah I saw that, too. Maybe thatâ€™s why I am hyper-vigilant when I see AI art shared around here, it is an amazing technology which currently occupies an ethical grey area (at best). And how the campaign uses AI art will impact how people understand the candidatesâ€™ stances on AI art and all the issues surrounding it.

At the end of the day, nobody is going to complain if there isnâ€™t AI art, but people will be upset if there is.
