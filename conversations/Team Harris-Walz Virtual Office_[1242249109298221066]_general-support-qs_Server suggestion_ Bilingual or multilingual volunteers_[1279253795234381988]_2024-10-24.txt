Content: Hi, beautiful MODs! Thanks in advance for all you do, what youâ€™ve built here is impressive!

Iâ€™m not sure if this has been brought up in the past or if itâ€™s already in motion, but it occurred to me that it could prove useful to add a channel dedicated to Spanish speakers or bilingual volunteers in general. Similar to how members are assigned roles according to their State, they could also choose to be assigned a language they are fluent in or comfortable enough to use when reaching out to voters. Yay for diversity!

Additionally, having select groups with assigned languages can be used as a resource for event organizers looking to target a specific demographic, and in turn, make the pool of volunteers easily accessible and ready to sign up! Put us in, Coach!

Just putting it out there, in case this speaks to anyone! Have a fantastic weekend!

Content: Hi <@682653283252437001> Staff is building a larger program inclusive of more languages. It will be a little while but when it's released it will be much more impactful than one channel.
