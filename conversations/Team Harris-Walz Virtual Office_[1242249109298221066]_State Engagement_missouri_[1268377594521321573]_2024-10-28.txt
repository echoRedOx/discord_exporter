Content: Hello Missouri! I just wanted to share this video, because I think this candidate will do great for your state. As someone outside of Missouri, Hawley has been a laughing stock of this country and you deserve better than that. Spread the word.

Content: Unfortunately the primaries drew 600,000 Republican votes for Hawley, and only 377,000 for Democrats total / 255,000 for Kunce, so will be hard to unseat him.

LUCAS KUNCE: You’re anti-labor, you’ve always been anti-labor. The only reason you say you’re not is bc you’re scared you’re gonna lose the election. That’s it. It’s embarrassing. https://x.com/mark_osmack/status/1824077317620039809

Content: From St. Louis, MO: Did you know that the online website (http://www.stlelections.com) for the City of St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners for the City of St. Louis is not active when I checked today? Here’s a message for it: “BUY THIS DOMAIN The domain stlelections.com may be for sale by its owner!” Is anyone looking into whether this could be happening elsewhere? It took a few different phone calls to finally get a “live person” and mention it. Just wondering 🤔

Content: There always seems like there's building and expanding going on. What I call the suburbs of Springfield (Nixa, Ozark, Republic etc.) have been boom'n also! More migration here from other states as they're finding out their $$$ buys more here. Realtor friend has said that she's never seen so many million dollar homes go up and sell.

Content: Hi! I'd venture to say not much has changed? I'm not originally from here, but I've been here for about 20 years now. I don't have much to compare it to. Still as 🟥  as ever! And when I say that I mean we need more Blue voters for real! I have seen a few more the last couple years, but not a ton in this small town.

Content: I am excited about the small business platform plank. I have been wondering how Democrats  could win back the rural voters. Small town America wants our downtowns to have small businesses, medical care available and internet services. I think the Harris campaign is caring about all three. For the future of small towns, vote blue 💙

Content: I don't know if this is a thing anyone wants or can use but I created this dossier to provide information for my friends and family circle for the election. It doesn't have every district race and stuff but it does have state and federal things for missouri as well as all the judges and a bunch of state and local amendments/propositions.  Obviously not an unbiased document but I tried to back up my points with research and reporting. I have final notes and thoughts throughout in green slides if you just want to see recommendations

There are so many and I feel like knowing who they are and how to activate them, could help progress be made.

Content: <@1276396030375624789> Depending on the year it's potentially another 50k-100k votes we could be getting. That plus rural population loss trends (mostly GOP votes), plus steady suburban increases and shifts blue, may be enough to get MO back to a swing state in 10-12 years

Content: I personally think it's a demoralization problem. St Louis city residents don't feel like anything substantively changes because they have democratic rep in the city but GOP rep in Jeff City and nothing gets better for them. So they don't see anybody as looking out for them from what I can tell.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Let's ensure Kamala Harris is elected!
