Content: Folks are gleefully retweeting this from Walz (in 2022!) and explaining what a runza is to out-of-staters.

Content: Lynn Walz is a state senator here in Nebraska. This is unsubstantiated by anything other than her facebook, but she said yesterday that Gov. Walz is her relative through marriage. Husband‚Äôs dad‚Äôs cousin.  Our unicameral is officially nonpartisan, but she is a Democrat.

Content: In a 2006 interview with the Daily News, Walz said he represents what it means to come up from the ‚Äúgrass roots.‚Äù He was part of a class of 25 who graduated from Butte High School in 1982, where grasslands were plentiful.

Walz said his biggest claim to fame in high school was that he was named to the Norfolk Daily News‚Äô Top 20 All Area football team. His senior year, the Butte Wildcats went 8-1 and the basketball team went 16-4.

‚ÄúIt was K-12 all in one building (in Butte) and during summers we worked on the farm,‚Äù Walz said. ‚ÄúI still have great friends from there. People in that graduating class ended up very successful. Nebraska has gotten a lot of criticism for not consolidating a lot of schools, but I believe that small classrooms and teaching in small classes has helped with the work ethic.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of successful people who have come from the small classrooms all over Nebraska. You didn‚Äôt get lost in the shuffle. Every student was an individual whose voice mattered.‚Äù

Content: üëÜ is a pretty big deal to die hard Cornhusker fans. These are the glory days of Nebraska football. In the comments when this was posted on Reddit are at least four other people who were at this game. One was 13, it was his first football game, and he threw snowballs at the people on the goal posts. This is a very Nebraska story. You can go to a bar in NYC, meet a Nebraskan, and find out your cousin married his elementary school art teacher. Nebraskans act irritated when someone assumes we all know each other, but it‚Äôs a little true.
