    re not interested and don\u2019t hang up? Do I continue on to the next part of\
    \ the script or just nicely thank them and hang up? Then do I hit the refuse button\
    \ for the call or something else?\n\nThank you!"

  content: No I wouldn't push it but you can offer some polite banter and see if it
    opens them up to talk.  Something like "I know you are getting a lot of calls
    so thank you so much for even answering.  I'm calling from the  Harris Walz campaign
    and I appreciate your time" or any variation!
