My reach is miniscule (for long story reasons), but I do have above-average pattern recognition and can combine this with professional experience growing audiences. I watch. I do a vibe check. Then drop in with an insight or add one with/to approved content to maximize my impact.

Sorta kinda how I mod? ðŸ˜… 

So it isn't any one thing. It is at the intersections of many where I quietly boost, amplify, and/or push back against what I am noticing in the gaps."

I usally entered ""other"" but it then made the conversation disjointed, because I couln'dt really go on to a good script. I accepted their privacy without hestitation, and jumped to asking if they needed help with polling locations, etc. It would be useful to have an option to input, ""unwilling to disclose."" I suspect they were Kamala voters because they almost always stuck with the call."
