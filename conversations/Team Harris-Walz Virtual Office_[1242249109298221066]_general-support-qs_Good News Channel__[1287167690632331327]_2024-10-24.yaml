  content: 'Hey everyone. I was just wondering if there is a channel dedicated to
    spreading good news about the campaign and victories in general. If not I thought
    I would suggest it. Maybe once a week HQ could write a post discussing what the
    campaign and/or our efforts here as volunteers for the campaign have achieved
    the past week.


    Just thought it would be nice to have and really motivating for all of us, as
    I know it can be easy to lose hope, especially for phonebankers who went through
    some rough calls.'
