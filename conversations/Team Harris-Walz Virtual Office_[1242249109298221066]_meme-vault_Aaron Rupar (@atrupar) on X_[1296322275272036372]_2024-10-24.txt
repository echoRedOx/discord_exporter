Content: Oof. I think I understand, right around the 2:00 minute mark and how that would make our trans siblings feel abandoned and disempowered after being embattled for several years.

Of course, I will bring this to the internal teams I am in contact with.

May I ask you two questions?
- When did you complete the form at the official campaign site?
- What can the campaign do to repair and reconcile the impact?

Content: Well the issue is not the answer she gave. It is the post *without* the full context makes it look like she is attacking Trump for not being transphobic enough.

Content: Please lmk what you can when you hear back. This has been really scary. The campaign has chosen to go light on talking about trans issues, opting to use the language of ‚Äúchoice over our own bodies‚Äù to lump us in with the abortion issue. By and large I think that‚Äôs smart, but the lack of explicit & proud support makes us nervous, especially as we see what is happening under Labour in the UK.

Content: My timeline is full of this. I know you are doing all you can. 

I just don‚Äôt understand why they haven‚Äôt slapped a community note on it or something. 

I can‚Äôt emphasize how this is 90% of the responses. They must see this.

Content: Good Morning, Harold!

I have bubbled up these concerns with the mods and to staff and I have asked to be kept in the loop. I know that they have heard us and are considering next steps.

In re: CNs I know that there can be some latency between requesting one, having the note be available to rate, and the CN being published.

Can I ask you to do two things for me?
1) Moving forward can you DM me screen shots? This way, we can reduce further harm to our fellow volunteers (and ourselves)?
2) While we cannot control QTs and the discourse, what are some small actions we can do offline that bring care and joy into the moment?

I'll be on shift from 3-6pm (US-Pacific) today, but I wanted to pop in and check on you before then. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Content: 1) Definitely 
2) I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. If you‚Äôre suggesting volunteering, I feel the wind is out my sails a bit at the moment. 

Thank you for the work you‚Äôve done and I am satisfied to know this is being worked on. Thanks again!

Content: You're welcome! 

I get how nerve-wracking watching something get the wrong kind of attention can be and we're discussing next steps. üôÇ
