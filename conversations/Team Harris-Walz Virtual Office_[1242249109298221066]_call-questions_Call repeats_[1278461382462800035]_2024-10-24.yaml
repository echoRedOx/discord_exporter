  content: I believe they had that issue yesterday and this  morning. I was only on
    the Zoom call for a little while but I think that closing the browser session
    and re-opening it and then relaunching the dialer resolved it. If you are on another
    phone banking session and have it re-occur, ask in the chat window. It would be
    good for them to know in case it is happening to a lot of other people too. And
    thanks so much for making calls with us! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

  content: 'Hi I actually have an answer here - our lists are alphabetic so sometimes
    we''ll make A LOT of calls to people with the same name. duplicate numbers are
    removed so it''s very unlikely that we''ll dial the same person within one campaign.


    If you let us know when you were calling and into what list, we can verify and
    triple check that there was no funny business here.'
