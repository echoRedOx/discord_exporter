Content: Hello Support team.. I am a Music Producer that created an Amazing Music Jingle for the campaign &  I wanted to volunteer my talent's & my song to the DNC. The jingle theme lyrics hits on all related topics such as "Kamala for President, coach Tim Walz (Coach TWüòä) .. 
" We Are Not Going Back""Joyful Warriors  & one of the most Important campaign slogans which is 
"VOTE VOTE VOTE !!!" 
Can you guide me in the right direction on how I can submit my music jingle for the possibilities of being used as one of the themes for the remainder of the campaign if it's liked & approved .. Thanks

Content: Hi there, you should start your own question thread with your question as I don't think the mods are necessarily looking at replies to the questions.

Content: Hi Bashaino, Linda is suggesting you make a new question instead of adding you message to her question about Hosts. But since I already answered you here it isn't necessary to make a new questions. Try reaching out to the campaign office with the contact page i shared. Also definitely share your jingle on your social platforms with hashtags that will be noticed by the campaign. Someone in the media office is more likely to find you that way.
