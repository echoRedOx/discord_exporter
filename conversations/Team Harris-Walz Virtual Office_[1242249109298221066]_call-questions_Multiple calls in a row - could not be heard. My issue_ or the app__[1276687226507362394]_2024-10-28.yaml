    Called several people today, had some good talks some hang ups... but recently
    a lot of my calls have gone ''unheard''. Even had someone say "I''m on a national
    do not call list" but I couldn''t even be heard!'

    a little more consistent with audio

  content: Thomas, I always use two devices and I can assure you don't need to share
    the network. You could call from a land line, it wouldn't matter so long as your
    using scale to win on the computer. Sometimes I also have issues where they can't
    hear me. Sometimes they are faking it and the reason I know that is because I
    learned some tricks. If it happens more than 3x in a row, just disconnect your
    phone (hang up) and restart the session.
