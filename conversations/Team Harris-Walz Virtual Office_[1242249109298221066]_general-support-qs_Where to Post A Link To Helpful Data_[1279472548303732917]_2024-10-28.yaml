  content: "I have a Twitter thread going to combat misinformation, where I write\
    \ short article posts on a variety of common topics Trumpists argue falsely about;\
    \ also updates with new content regularly. All sources are cited and credible\
    \ (ex-CDC studies; official gov\u2019t docs). I imagine it\u2019d be great for\
    \ community notes people because you can copy/paste straight from the posts I\
    \ write and link to the sources too. Also great for self education or in response\
    \ to trolls. But I don\u2019t want to post it in the wrong place! Just updated\
    \ it today with more myth busting facts on the whole \u201Cborn alive\u201D debate.\
    \ Link below for review; please let me know where it should go or if it\u2019\
    s not allowed.\n\nhttps://x.com/thesociophi/status/1829657620548108326?s=46"
