    \  The July 20th Facebook is the most recent that I\u2019ve been able to find.\
    \  I would like updated graphics with link as soon as possible so folk can spread\
    \ it before the Sept 10th debate.  Can we get both Facebook & Instagram as soon\
    \ as possible?  Can you also post it in REACH?  It takes a while for it to be\
    \ shared \u201Cfar & wide,\u201D and you can even track donations collected during\
    \ the debate.  Thanks!"
