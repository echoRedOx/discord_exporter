They keep posting messages that they need someone from the campaign to contact them. Message gets bigger every day. Here is what the Home page looks like when you try to buy a T-shirt.

They'd probably like to sell it to the campaign, since according to news reports, they spent $15k to buy the domain. It's nice that they're at least forwarding to the official site, for now."
