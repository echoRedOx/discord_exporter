Content: Hi all, I‘d like to see the Call Her Daddy episode full video. I can finde video snippets everywhere, and the audio podcast. But not video. 

Omg. “Some of us are not aspiring to be humble.” Best line evar. 

I am so conflicted because I think Harris is the best candidate in modern times who represents my POV and then I read news about Blinken approving bombs on humanitarian aid (both paid for by our tax dollars). 

Just going to trust the process for now.

Content: I found a weird youtube that has the whole video, but they have replaced the background with weird graphics, and I wouldn't want to send it around. Do you want the link?

Content: Thanks for the reminder to watch it. It was a great interview with some hard questions. My favorite quote from Kamala: “Some people think the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who they beat down, but the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who they lift up.” KAMALA FOR THE WIN!!!

Content: Yes I believe she has a Spotify contract so full episodes are only there. https://open.spotify.com/episode/4B9WOUCWY8qY0f9MMjOSXa?si=91e53b46fe874c99
