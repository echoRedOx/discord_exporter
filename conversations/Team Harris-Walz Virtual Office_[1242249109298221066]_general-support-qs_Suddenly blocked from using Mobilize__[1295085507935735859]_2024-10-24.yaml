  content: I was signing up for a text bank and I suddenly am getting blocked from
    using Mobilize. I was clicking the link from Instagram so I don't know if that
    made it seem suspicious? But now I can't access it on my phone or computer so
    I feel like it is my IP being blocked. It says to email the owner but there is
    no email.

  content: I'm hearing it may be working again. Also, some users have found Firefox
    to work if you use Chrome. Thanks for your patience!

  content: <@568257600228032512> and I verified a workaround for the Mobilize issue.  Use
    Mozilla Firefox to access Mobilize US.  When you get the Magic Link, paste the
    long link into Firefox URL address bar.  That should work.  Thanks, Jay E
