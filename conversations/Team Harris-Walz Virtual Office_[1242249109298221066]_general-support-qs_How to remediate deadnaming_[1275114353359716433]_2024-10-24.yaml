  content: "Thank you, Paul. That certainly helps on the state end, and I do know\
    \ many here at the county level and some at the state level. \n\nWhat I worry\
    \ about is that it won\u2019t reach the national level in a timely manner and\
    \ I will continue to be deadnamed anyway for the duration of our campaign.\n\n\
    Also, if they give me the \u201Cit\u2019s not your legal name\u201D excuse then\
    \ I will have some especially strong words as well. It is not necessarily safe\
    \ for folks to legally change their name at various points in time. A social name\
    \ change must be plenty. Behind the scenes there are cases where a legal name\
    \ must be used but out in the open it\u2019s a very different matter. \n\nAddressing\
    \ someone by their chosen/preferred name is nothing less than a life saving act,\
    \ and that doesn\u2019t just apply to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nSo I ask again,\
    \ even as I\u2019m reaching out to my state org, is there anyone HERE who has\
    \ connections to help expedite that change?"
