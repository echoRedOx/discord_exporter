Content: I was on the phone bank for PA earlier today and it kept connecting me to “Michael” who would hang up every time. Any way to avoid that in the future?

Content: I believe they had that issue yesterday and this  morning. I was only on the Zoom call for a little while but I think that closing the browser session and re-opening it and then relaunching the dialer resolved it. If you are on another phone banking session and have it re-occur, ask in the chat window. It would be good for them to know in case it is happening to a lot of other people too. And thanks so much for making calls with us! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

Content: Hi I actually have an answer here - our lists are alphabetic so sometimes we'll make A LOT of calls to people with the same name. duplicate numbers are removed so it's very unlikely that we'll dial the same person within one campaign.

If you let us know when you were calling and into what list, we can verify and triple check that there was no funny business here.
