  content: 'Hi <@690550534549012520>. Welcome! Thanks so much for signing up for part
    one of our zoom training. I strongly encourage you to give the live zoom a try.
    We leave the chat box open so you can ask any questions that you have there while
    the session is underway. It''s a great overview of what we''re doing online and
    how you can help with our various tools. (I''m not aware of any available recordings
    or transcripts.)  Should you have specific questions about those tools, such as
    Reach, you''re welcome to jump right back here in our Online Engagement channel
    within Discord and ask!  You may also wish to check out this Reach Quick Start
    Guide: https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Reach-for-Social-Ambassadors-Quick-Start-Guide.pdf   Thanks
    again!'
