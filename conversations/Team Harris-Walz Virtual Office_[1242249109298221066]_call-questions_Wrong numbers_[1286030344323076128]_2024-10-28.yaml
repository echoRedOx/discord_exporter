  content: "Just wanted to ask if the Democratic Party actually removes wrong numbers\
    \ from our lists. I\u2019ve had countless people tell me we\u2019ve been calling\
    \ the wrong person for the last decade, in some cases as much as the past 15 years."

  content: Yes wrong numbers are removed from the DNC list but there are multiple
    groups calling voters using the same public voter records so if number is wrong
    in the public voter records, will again pop up as wrong. And yes this can recycle
    for years.
