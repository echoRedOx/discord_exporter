  content: Last night, I was on a phone bank (my third) and the moderator wanted to
    take a photo of us (I'm guessing a screenshot of the Zoom). They asked us to pose
    with our cell phones. I was wondering how these photos were going to be used.
    It didn't really bother me (I'm proud to be phone banking for Harris Walz team)
    but I wasn't sure if all of us phone banking were comfortable with this sudden
    request. Just putting this out there FYI.

  content: Thank you. Again, it didn't really bother me, but I was curious as to what
    it was for since there was no explanation (or I may have missed the explanation).
    But if there are hundreds of folks doing phone banking, there may always be those
    who wouldn't want their names publicized. Our names are on our Zoom screens.

  content: <@824045831673872385> I've found out that our partner organization for
    west coast phone banking does this often during their Zoom sessions to post the
    image on social media. I've also made a recommendation that in the future they
    ask first to allow anyone who does not want their images published to opt out.
    Thanks again for making us aware! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

    I trained to do the calls through slack and the dialer there.

  content: The campaign keeps the SLACK crew active with so many active experienced
    callers from the 2020 and 2022 campaigns. Slack has the "anytime calls" feature
    that callers like. DISCORD builds community with a lot of opps for volunteering.
    For calls - both use the dialer "Scale to Win"
