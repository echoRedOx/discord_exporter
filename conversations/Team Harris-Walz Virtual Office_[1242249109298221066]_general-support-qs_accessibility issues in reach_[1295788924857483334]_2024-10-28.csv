The Kamala's Captains were talking about how to support visually impaired folks who want to phone bank. If you have any suggestions, can I put you in touch?"

I also see Calls team has a voice channel to do the support over audio instead of on screen. Maybe KC can use a voice channel"

We are looking for ways to make Zoom Phone Banking more accessible, so if anyone has any ideas, let me know.

<@568257600228032512> - Thank you for checking in. Unfortunately, Zoom Phone Banking happens over ""Scale to Win"", so we cannot make the text bigger. I do not think anyone in KC needs a voice channel -- it is volunteers who need a voice channel."

I don't know anything about Scale to Win, but the Ctrl/Cmd + works on all pages in Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Safari."
