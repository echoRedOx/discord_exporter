Content: Where can we find ads that get aired on cable network channels? I checked KH‚Äôs YouTube but didn‚Äôt see them there. I‚Äôm not sure where else to look, and I don‚Äôt see them getting posted to the campaign social channel.

Content: <@1267620032393773197> Why are some ads not public on the [campaign's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@kamalaharris/videos )?  Can Reach add [a gallery](https://app.reach.vote/library/galleries?campaign=democrats) for ads?

Content: That's a great question! We try to get all of the ads up on Reach as we possibly can and I will relay the suggestion for a gallery for ads to folks on our team!

Content: Thanks!  I know that ads not uploaded on the campaign's YouTube would usually be posted on the campaign's social media, but that's harder to find among the campaign's many accounts on each platform.  When I share from the campaign's social media to *another* platform though, the shared ad loses its "play" button (because of technical issues with embedding to another platform).

Content: Thanks so much to both of you. It makes it a lot easier having a separate tab for ads than having to search for them on YouTube and use a downloader which doesn‚Äôt always work.
