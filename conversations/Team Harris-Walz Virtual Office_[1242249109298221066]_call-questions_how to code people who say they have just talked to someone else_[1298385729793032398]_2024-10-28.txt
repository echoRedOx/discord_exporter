Content: The last two people I reached just said that they had just talked to someone else and didn't want to repeat themselves with me. Should I mark that as refused, hostile? it is possible that they are Harris supporters but have just been contacted by someone else, and I don't want to cancel out the appropriate follow-up if I code them Refused.
