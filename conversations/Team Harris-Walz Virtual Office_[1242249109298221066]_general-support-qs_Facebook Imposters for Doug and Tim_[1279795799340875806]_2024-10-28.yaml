  content: 'I am noticing fake FB profiles for Tim Walz. And my FB group has a member
    that appears to be Doug Emhoff with 500 followers and no checkmark. Is the Harris
    team staying on top of this? They are posting positive things, but I am concerned
    that they will suddenly post crazy stuff in October and gullible voters will think
    it is real. Is this one real? If so, why no checkmark?

  content: Hi there! Thank you for raising this concern. We don't handle this on our
    server team since we're the online (from home) volunteer branch of the campaign,
    but staff who sees this can pass it along to the right place for assessment. Thank
    you!
