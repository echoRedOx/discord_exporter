Content: Slightly random question that may or may not be right for this channel: I spend a lot of my workday in Excel, cleaning and entering medim-sized downloads of data. Could those Excel skills be useful for the campaign, as all this calling/canvassing/texting data comes in or as lists from other orgs are prepped for those activities? I've been doing texting, here and for Contest Every Race, and can continue with that, just wondering if my Excel skills could be useful as well.

Content: Hi <@1277218529304772629> I assume this is all automated, as far as I know we don't have anyone here doing hands-on spread sheet work with with our lists. Keep on texting and consider participating in our 5 million calls this weekend. https://events.democrats.org/event/730026/
