My friend's mom is working with https://www.vopropros.com/ - they reach out to people who have voted Dem in the past but are inactive. She is doing a lot of work in Pennsylvania because there are some senate seats that are flippable. Like https://www.ehaszforcongress.com/. There are several races in NC that are also flippable, my friend is leading the efforts at https://sites.google.com/view/neverandnow-co/home. Do you know which are the critical races around Richmond?  I would suggest keeping an eye on the welcome chat and the  PA, VA, WV and NC chats. So you can welcome anyone from the region as they come on and share any information you are getting from your social media or otherwise. Introduce people who are doing similar work to each other and help them connect either by interest or region."

You should take your lead from that channel on any national election efforts. My social media approach has been trying the following. I stopped following any distractions, I'm currently only following people who I love to see succeed and those who lift me up. My first post was an honest video of myself letting folks know where I am emotionally and why it is important to me that I give this campaign my all. I use the posts from influencers I listen to with a supper short comment that connect the issue to future consequences and Kamala's  agenda and or qualifications. I dont know how to add pictures here so if you want to see an example you can see it on my instagram. thats the only platform i kinda know how to use so thats what im focusing on. t.mf.aidanator is my handle. its public so you dont have to follow me to see it."

We launched canvassing, had a party after at a Black owned restaurant, and had activities for kids like making Swiftie bracelets for voting, karaoke and the DNC playlist, had free pizzas, and lots of signs and enthusiasm. One guy yelled ""Harris can kiss my hairy ass"" as he drove away like a baby - we shouted back ""she doesn't want to, honey!"" but we got more honks of support than mad hollers. Apparently our Republican committee is freaking out and want to know how they can have more events in that shopping center (clutches pearls, faints on couch). Just to say - hang in there, and keep getting out there. One lady who came to the event said as a Black woman with opinions she feels like such a target, but coming to see she's not alone meant a lot to her. We had Black elders there too, and y'all, their stories. You, in your community, probably know someone who remembers having to pay a poll tax in Virginia. We're NOT GOING BACK!"

I will call to see if I can get this question answered. 
It is a bit frustrating. 
We want everyone to have access to voting and yet I am trying to help some of the Hispanic voters I know and this seems an obvious question‚Ä¶ 
EVERY vote is important. And these ladies are definitely voting for Kamala and Tim. 
I volunteered to drive them to the voting locations but I need to know if they will be able to read the ballots."

A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

Phonebanking is our **number one priority** so close to the election, and it‚Äôs a phenomenal way to get started. We often set goals for specific numbers, like how we set a goal for 5 million calls this past weekend. We made 4.6 million, reaching immense numbers of people!
