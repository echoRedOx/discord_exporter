Content: Hi <@1277361487270121624> Thanks for reaching out. We don't have texting for March for Our Lives at this server. Our text trainings have ended, but you can check out ⁠⁠the <#1268426751164551199> or <#1298623273566732300> channels. If you are already part of the Persuasion Text Team, you can ask texting questions in #persuasion-team-questions . We would also love help with making phone calls during this final stretch -- you can sign up for that at https://events.democrats.org/event/725393/ . Thank you!
