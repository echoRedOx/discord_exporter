  content: I've gotten a couple people who have expressed call fatigue - most of them
    Strong harris and didn't mind chatting with me again, but this one call was very
    hostile, said it was rude to call during dinner and said both parties were out
    of control with advertising and texts and calls making him angry and now he wouldn't
    vote for either. I put him on the do not call and apologized but does anyone else
    have suggestions?
