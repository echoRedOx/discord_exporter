I'm interested in traveling to a swing state sometime in the week before the election to do in-person canvassing, and I was wondering if there were preferred states for volunteers to go to (e.g. Michigan, Georgia)? Thanks for the help."

You can type ""canvass"" in the search box and put the state, city, or zip code in the location box."
