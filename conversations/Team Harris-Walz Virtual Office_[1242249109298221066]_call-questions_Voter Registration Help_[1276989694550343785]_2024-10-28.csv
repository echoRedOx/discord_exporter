Vote411.com is a great resource! It walks prospective voters through registering and creating a voting plan. Their ‚ÄúVoting in my State‚Äù program is especially helpful, as it helps them find registration deadlines, election dates, their polling place, local elections or ballot measures that are specific to their state/district, and more!"

The lady I'm trying to help has hearing and mobility issues, so trying to resolve anything over the phone won't be optimal.  I'm trying to get ahold of someone local to help her.  I contacted the Savannah Dem office via email to see if anyone there can help."
