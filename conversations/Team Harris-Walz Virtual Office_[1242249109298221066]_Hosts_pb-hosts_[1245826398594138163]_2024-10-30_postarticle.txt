Content: Hi, I’m Karen from the Silicon Valley in Northern California with the Democratic Volunteer Center. We have over 8000 members. We have a website and have an office that can accommodate 100 or more phone bankers. How do I get connected to the organizers of phone banks? I’ve been reaching out for a couple of days.

Content: Hi <@1273713003312713801> , your event wont be visible until you have a 1 on 1 with an organizer. We do this as a security precaution so we can prevent bad actors from staging events on mobilize. I just sent you an email with a link to book a 1 on 1 with the subject line: Hosting a phone bank event!

Content: Hey Steva In the landing page there will be a second link which you copy and past to send to your phone bankers. Volunteers don't need to download anything, the link you pull out of the landing page runs through the browser. You can absolutely send the volunteers the training video.

Content: Good morning! I'm supporting in-person/virtual phonebanks across TX this wkd (9/7-8). I was advised that the dialer links rotate often, so if any of my hosts need support, who/where is the best place to reach out? (I'll probably be on Discord, but it'd be great if I could direct other hosts somewhere to solve independently.)

Also, people are asking about parking at the rallies, do we have that info anywhere?

Content: hi all, I have someone who signed up for my phone bank, but she doesn't have a personal laptop. Can she just do the dialer through her cell phone? I know it's not ideal, but let me know if you have any suggestions. Additonally, I have another person who would love to do some Spanish-first calls. Do we have a list for Spanish speakers that she can call through?

Content: Hi <@878004392769490995> - Sorry for the late reply, Thanks so much for being an active volunteer. One of my fellow mods, who also registered voters in that area, found this site.  Normally, we only post dot gov sites for voting info, but I am making an exception here. For San Diego Dems from the SB Co Registrar: https://sbcountyelections.com/community-outreach/

Content: Thanks Phone Bank Hosts: A common host question is how to find the deck needed for a session. If someone cannot see Host Support, be sure they have host added as one of their roles.  Ultimately, the Google Doc link is one you may have to be added to, so a Kamala's Captain will message you the deck link needed. KC is the phone bank leader team. Thanks.  See example here: https://discord.com/channels/1242249109298221066/1245826306780823563/1288570394810384516

Content: <@&1242265414118019162> team- A reminder **PLEASE DO NOT EVER COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM VOTERS DURING PHONE BANKS**

The only time we are authorized to collect personal information is if we are prompted by the Scale to Win platform to ask for a phone number to send a confirmation text. Even then, we only put that number into the dialer software and send the text. 

**We do not have a vehicle for calling back individual voters**

Collecting voter information creates a dynamic where we may have  promised something we can't deliver and make the campaign look bad, OR  2) taken on a liability for collecting personal information should something bad then happen with that information. 


Additional reminder- **NO PERSONAL INFORMATION SHOULD BE SHARED VIA THIS DISCORD SERVER**  If you choose to share your personal information with another server member, please do so via DM. NEVER EVER EVER share someone else's information on here. 
Thank you for understanding.

Content: I was wondering about that. Thank you for clarifying <@1276944250491113656>. As far as finding polling place info, I would not mind doing that research, but I need an email to send it to, as it would be done outside of calling hours.

Content: Hello, I hosted an in person phonebank tonight. I had to cut off registration at 15 people a few days ago, but only 1 person showed up. I knew some people wouldn't actually show up, but has this type of drop off happened to other people? were people confused and thought it was virtual?

Content: <@1287869697538129983> Thank you for hosting an in person phone bank. I am assuming you made it clear in your event description and title that the event was in person. I suspect that you are right about the misunderstanding. When you write the next description, think about in-person selling points (maybe snacks), supportive presence in the room and a small group of like minded people.  If this is at a private residence, be sure to hide the address, so it only goes out to those who register.  https://help.mobilize.us/en/articles/5857592-create-an-event-as-a-host

Content: @Sarah  You can also call the day before your event.  Just a quick call to say "Hi I'm looking forward to seeing you tommorow".  That serves as a reminder and it's makes them more accountable.  That will boost your attendance and give you a better idea who will be there.  This method has been proven over the years.  Good luck!!

The Host is R. Carleen Cordwell.  I do not believe she has joined this Discord yet as she is not particularly tech savy  - that's where I come in! lol

When I click on the link that says, "Email Your Attendees About Your Event", it doesn't give me an option to create a Mailing List so I can add the actual emails of each individual I am inviting.

Content: Thank you, <@936359743457464391> .  I don't even see an option on the Mobilize Dashboard menu to upload an email list.    I also have a follow up question.  I received an email with my sign up link to email to prospective invitees, but when i sent it to myself to make sure the link was working properly, I get an error msg saying "This event is no longer available."  Is that because the event is still awaiting approval?  If so, why would I get an event link if the event hasn't even been approved.  Apologies if this question has been answered previousl.  I am new to discord and not too familiar with how to search/use it.

Content: What I’m saying is I don’t see anywhere to upload a list of email addresses to your event. I thought that was a question and that’s what I was answering. You can have your people sign up by sharing your link and then you can export or do anything you want with the contacts however I’m not seeing a spot where you can upload your email list to populate your event. I hope that’s what you were asking. Thanks!

Content: Yes. You need to email your list and share the link. You still can send one email and blind copy everyone. I don’t see the option to upload a list and when I look it up it didn’t say that option was available. I’m looking up your event to see what I can do

Content: So it wasn’t approved. I’ve approved it. Your link should now work.  When I tried the link in a new browser tab, it allows me options to sign up for all your events starting tomorrow.  😊

Content: I played with this and it looks like the events site will auto send emails to the emails on file when selecting the “email all guests” option. But that only works once they are enrolled. So for first contact to invite folks you know to register, must email directly from personal account. Later it looks like host can send emails to any registered but won’t see the email addresses as the system handles it for them. Does this seem about right <@871529274975334431>?

Content: So Mobilize does not create the Zoom link for you, you have to set up a Zoom event personally then enter the link into the event to be sent prior to all attendees. For today's event, the best way to handle this is to create a Zoom event link yourself and send it to the 3 people who are registered. Then, for future events, we can have one of our team members add that zoom link to your events from the back end so it will work for all future events. (You'll want to make the Zoom link a recurring one at this time essentially, so this will work).

Content: <@799760395161436181> -I think that the dialer software will allow screen enlargement and a screen reader because we work with multiple formats - Mac Windows. etc.  Not speaking officially, just generally, since the volunteer is using their own system.  Update: Hopefully, we can get their system with its accessibility features set to work, but if not, we can get them started with friend-banking which is a different interface.

Content: Hello--We had a volunteer leave our phone bank because she has low vision and was unable to work with the dialer. Are there any support systems in place for people who are vision impaired, or any other opportunities we can point them to?

Content: Hi <@1266028248706322492> some low-vision volunteers have been able to use screen readers, but it is clunky. Staff are aware of this barrier and are hoping to connect to address this. We have several accessibility specialists who have volunteered to assist, but at this time, we do not have a great solution.

Content: @here Good afternoon my fantastic H4H phone bank hosts! To help facilitate a better experience around list switches me and other members of staff will begin using this channel to communicate with any of you who may be hosting events at that time. This will ensure that we keep our call volume up as high as possible, since we tend to experience dips in volume when we have to switch lists. Please let us know if you have any questions or thoughts, and as always thank you for your hard work and service!

Content: I always say to compare P25 plan side-by-side to see that they are virtually identical except Trump's is even more strict/stringent. For your own reference and fact-checking on this so you can cite these sources:

Content: I was working on a phonebank reshifting list, and after it finished, I was pointed at a phonebanking list: "Ready: H4H Recruitment_101224_ Type: Recruitment" which I'm glad to do, but not sure if I've been appropriately trained on it yet. Where should I ask about that?

Content: Hi! I am on the dialer right now, and I have a voter who wasn't going to vote, but is strongly considering voting for Harris now. Is there a way I can mark him as needing a follow up, because he said he'd think about questions he had?
