Content: Have gotten a few people who have already voted (often for Kamala - yay!) but want to be taken off the list. How long does that take to get processed? I had one person say it was the fourth time they asked to be removed, they like everything we're doing but want our time to be better spent than calling someone who already voted democrat.

Content: Hi, Sarah,  We understand how frustrating and sometimes annoying it is to get all of these calls.  You and I get them, too, but we are probably a bit more sympathetic b/c we are doing the work.  One issue is that there are a lot of organizations making calls.  Voter registration information is public and any org can and does request the info to make the calls.  The voter can request 'do not call' and be removed from each org's list as they receive calls, but there is not just one place for the voter to go to request being removed from ALL lists.  The good news is that the lists are scrubbed regularly and once a voter's ballot has been marked as received, they SHOULD be removed from further call lists.  If you are able to explain this , some folks will understand, some will still annoyed.  Don't take it personally.  Thank them for their time and move on.  There are still A LOT of undecided voters and folks who may need a gentle push or hand holding to get their vote to the ballot box.  Thank you for being here and doing this hard work.  When we fight, WE WIN!!
