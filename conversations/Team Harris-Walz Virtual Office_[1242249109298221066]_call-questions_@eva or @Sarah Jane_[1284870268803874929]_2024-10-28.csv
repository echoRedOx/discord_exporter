I saw a blank for today for a co-facilitator, 9/15, 4-6p. I completed my shadow shift yesterday. I will sign up for the shift so I can get the link. Will someone let  me in when I arrive early?"

Can someone send me the Zoom link? This is my first time co-facilitating. Thanks.  I'll also look in the facilitator channel. (I am new to Discord, too!)"

Log in 20 minutes early.  At 15 minutes early, the host will log on and admit you.  Move yourself to the VOTE team room (sometimes called the debrief room or preparation room…not practice room)."

Where do I find the facilitator background? Found the link for the shift in the red type at the upper left of the spreadsheet. I will be there at 20 minutes to the hour (4 ET/3CT). Very excited! Thanks!

I'm loath to play with it - since it looks fine to me. And I don't want to see my image while I'm facilitating anyway. Thanks as always!

I'm reviewing the training slide deck. It says the updated deck for the day/session will be sent by email. I'll be fine without the newest deck, since the training deck doesn't change.

I also have mirroring on so because it's disconcerting to have it off. So my background looks backwards to me but forward to everyone else who sees me not mirrored! I just checked with the other Captains to make sure the first time I used it."
