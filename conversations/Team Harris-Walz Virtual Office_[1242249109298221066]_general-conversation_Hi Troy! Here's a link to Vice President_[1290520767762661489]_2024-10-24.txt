Content: Thanks, this is a great resource. I am still confused though -- the document states that "**[Harris's] proposal builds on the Biden-Harris Administrationâ€™s work** to reduce barriers to homeownership based on medical debt and limited credit history. The Administration sought to recognize renters who regularly pay their rent on time, by incorporating a borrowerâ€™s positive rental payment history into the analysis **for first-time homebuyers to qualify for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans that are underwritten by the federal government**. "

So when we're saying that the Harris proposal builds on the previous work, we're saying that the new proposal is now involving a grant and not a loan like the previous work? Or is this saying that the proposal is expanding the Biden-Harris loan program to broaden the criteria for getting these loans or increasing the amount?

Content: Hi <@231995843731914752> - All good questions that I'm not sure we are equipped to answer. We only have the document itself. The intent and interpretation is not something we are comfortable weighing in on.

Content: I see there is a reference to the Detroit Down Payment Assistance Program, which according to their website (Ref: <https://detroitmi.gov/departments/housing-and-revitalization-department/homebuyers/detroit-down-payment-assistance-program/how-does-it-work>), is in fact a grant not a loan, so this would lead me to believe it is probably a grant* program being proposed.

Just something to be mindful of the difference. In my conservative/Republican circles there is opposition to this policy because they are concerned that giving away assistance in the form of grants will push home prices up. Although, the most common objection I hear is that "it would raise the cost of all homes by $25k", but I don't believe this is even close to accurate because the impact on the market depends on how many buyers qualify for the highest level of assistance or qualify at all, depending on the details. Convincing my conservative friends on this issue is probably going to be a tall order, but from my perspective, even if it does impact home prices to some degree, it is worth it for us as a society if the end result is a higher rate of home ownership

Content: As a CA resident, I have to agree. It's also interesting that pushing up home prices is a bad thing here but when talking about crime or immigration, the rhetoric is that it will lower home prices. Good talking points for people in phone banks and out canvassing or in OE. Have you been seeing this come up in voter engagement on any of those teams?

Content: no, I'm still a newbie here so wouldn't know even if there was. just providing my perspective coming from the right (republican for harris), I want to make sure I know what I'm talking about when people try to tell me all of harris's policies are communist ðŸ˜‚

Content: that's fair. I will say that our Republicans who phone bank tend to gain a lot of traction when we're calling swing states because they can speak to why they support Harris and ppl are more inclined to listen

Content: yeah, I escaped MAGA in 2020. Just speaking anecdotally, in my experience so far, many of the people in my right wing circles have been willing to hear me out when I approach them respectfully and I outline my reasons why I think Republicans made a mistake re-nominating Trump. They tend to disagree in going as far as saying that the fastest and best way to get the party back on track is to put country first this time and support Harris. But ever since Biden dropped out I am seeing much more openness to the idea that Trump has taken things too far. keep up the good work ðŸ™‚
