Content: Hi I was recently trained on phone banking and have a follow up question: I don't see a response in the script for when a different person than the one I'm calling comes to the phone. There are lots of choices: answering machine, hostile, do not call etc. but if it's just "not Joe" what's next? Thank you in advance!

Content: If it's a different person answering the phone and the person you are looking for isnt there right now, please select "busy/call back." If the person who answers says that the person you're looking for isn't at that number anymore, select "wrong number." Thanks!

Content: You don't need to. You can just say "okay, thank you so much!" And end the call

Content: I also engage the person I am speaking with, ask them if they are registered, if they watched the debates, who they liked most and why, or where they get their info and then engage them on topics. Every vote matters! 

I then explain I will call back for the other person too!
