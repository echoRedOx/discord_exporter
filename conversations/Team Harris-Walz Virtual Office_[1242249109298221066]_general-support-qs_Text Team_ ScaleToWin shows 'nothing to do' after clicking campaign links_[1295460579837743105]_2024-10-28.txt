Content: When I click on a texting campain link in the <#1265788349747171438> channel, I just see the 'nothing to do' page - not even grayed campain buttons. I am returning to texting after taking a break for about two weeks. When I go to the top-level url at that site, I see the message about not being registered. What do I need to do to get back into texting? Can a text-team mod verify that my ScaleToWin account is still connected with this? I was directed to post here by a text-team mod.
