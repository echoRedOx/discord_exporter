Feels very much like being CENSORED..."

If they don't like what *I haven't even posted yet, * Facebook won't allow me to post what I was trying to say or anything else at all for that matter.  I was totally silenced by Facebook today from the #1A crowd even.  I Decided to walk away and post elsewhere where nobody is sitting in a cubicle somewhere getting paid to watch my every move.  Its very disconcerting and I totally lost my mojo today when that happened and if I can't sleep it off tonight I will be too depressed to even want to share a post when my depression could rub off on someone.  those are the days I don't post but I'm hoping to sleep it off"

PERSIST!!...xxx I know the media companies have figured some of this out, like how to not get flagged or blocked from posting...I'm going to watch them more and see if I can pick up some hints from the way they post. The took down some of my comments which were definitely fine. It was me posting ""I'm voting for Harris"" or just emojis, <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> üá∫üá∏ üíØ . Meanwhile they leave up TRVMP 2024 all over the place...Meta has their thumb on the scale this election...no question in my mind. I'm trying to mix it up with original photos and not just reposting from other sources. We shall see how it goes. If I get too frustrated with SM I will get on the phone and start calling voters. They can't stop us from doing that!!...LOL...üíê...dang it, if I have to I will be out in the street with chalk and write on the sidewalk...Kamala Harris 2024!!!"

Liking and commenting is also helpful. I feel your frustration...x
