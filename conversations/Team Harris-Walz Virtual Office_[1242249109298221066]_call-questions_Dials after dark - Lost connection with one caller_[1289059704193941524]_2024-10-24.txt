Content: Hi, I lost wifi briefly with one caller who was interested in volunteering in a future week. I only remember their first name and when I reopened the dialer, they were no longer there. Is it possible for one of the calls teams organizers to give them a call or text back?

Content: <@415244010928472074> it isn't, unfortunately, but if you didn't close the survey, hopefully it will put her back into the queue

Content: Yep I was unable to complete the survey so it should be okay. I hope they didn't think I was hanging up on them. ðŸ˜…  This was the only time my wifi went down so if it goes down again, I'll wrap up early

Content: Thank you so much Jen! I actually just exited the dialer a minute ago and submitted the form, but thank you for your kind words. I had a really positive experience tonight with a lot of people saying they'd vote for her if they couldn't volunteer, and I will definitely join more sessions in the upcoming days!
