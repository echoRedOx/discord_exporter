I think I may have accidentally done so for the Harris campaign, because I haven't been getting any texts for a couple of weeks now. I tried texting JOIN to 30330, but I'm not sure if that will fix the problem. Can anyone check on this for me?"

If you texted 30330 that signed you up again and you should be receiving texts going forward. Let me know in a few days if you are still waiting to receive texts.

I think JOIN got me back in when I opted out at some point.
