  content: "Hi Blake! While we are officially affiliated with the DNC, we are only\
    \ the national online volunteer branch, mostly volunteers from the nationwide\
    \ online training events. We aren't the staff who work directly with Harris-Walz\
    \ on the campaign writing/messaging, we just distribute it. \n\nThat said, as\
    \ a professional writer myself,  I love your enthusiasm and passion for this.\
    \ Let me get you the link to the currently available positions, which would have\
    \ to be applied for directly, not here. \U0001F609"

    cities, mostly not remote excepting a few data analysis positions. **I'm not sure
    how to reach the same team for any volunteer work but if I find out, I'll let
    you know!**
