  content: "Several posts say DMs come to the \u201Cgame controller\u201D icon which\
    \ is the usual Discord image in the upper left. I don\u2019t have that icon on\
    \ mine. Instead, right above the pic of Kamala, there\u2019s what looks like a\
    \ chat icon in Zoom or iMessage on iPhone or iPad. I use Discord on my iPad, haven\u2019\
    t installed on my Mac. 1) Do I receive and send DMs through this chat icon or\
    \ do I have to change settings on my Discord? 2) Am I seeing this chat or message\
    \ icon only because I\u2019m using the mobile app, and the game controller shows\
    \ up on the desktop version? Thanks for answering and for all the hard work you\
    \ do."

  content: "HI David! You nailed the answer actually! It shows up as a cartoon bubble\
    \ on iOS and as a game controller on laptop/desktop. \U0001F642 You can find your\
    \ DMs and incoming DM requests there. You can customize your settings to allow\
    \ all messages or to require your manual approval first (those go in pending requests\
    \ and show up easier once you actually have one)."

  content: "Ophelia: The response you just typed does not appear in the bubble icon.\
    \ It only shows up in this general support qs screen. The same has been true with\
    \ other answers to questions. There is nothing in the bubble except a message\
    \ I sent to a member of the campaign. Is that how it should be or is there a setting\
    \ I need to change? It\u2019s fine if discussions show up in various channels\
    \ but it would be helpful if DMs showed up in the DM icon and I got notification\
    \ of answers. Thanks."

  content: "That's how it should be. You come here in the server chat rooms and forums.\
    \ Chat rooms/forums are the ones with # < these hashtags in front of them in the\
    \ sidebar menu. This is the server. The chat bubble you're seeing is for private\
    \ DMs (direct messages) where users can send private messages to one another outside\
    \ this server, but still in the discord app. \n\nWe also have a great intro to\
    \ discord video here for learning your way around here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA32MMsN61g"
