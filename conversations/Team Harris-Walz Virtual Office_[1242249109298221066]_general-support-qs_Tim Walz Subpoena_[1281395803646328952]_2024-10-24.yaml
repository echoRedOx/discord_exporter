  content: "The campaign does not reply to specific news stories except what you will\
    \ find on social media and occassional press releases, which are not listed online\
    \ anywhere. They just show up in news stories mostly. \n\nSo on this server, since\
    \ we're really just focused on online volunteer campaign work and don't get this\
    \ far into the weeds most of the time, we like to have these conversations in\
    \ <#1268690577960992878> where those interested can discuss (but not debate) and\
    \ develop an informed response should it come up. Though, it's unlikely to come\
    \ up often in volunteer work here since it's highly specific."
