Content: Some scripts have an already voted option, if not select who they intend to vote for and how - if you are able to get that detail.  You can select end survey after entering the relevant info.  When they vote they'll be removed from our list.

Content: Most scripts don't have the already voted. In the zPBs, we ask who they support, thank them, and end call. As said above, if they actually did vote, they will be removed from the lists.

Content: I've had multiple people in the past hour that have voted, but won't say for who - it would be nice to have an option for that!

Content: its a state by state decision which survey questions appear.  Refused is appropriate if they won't tell you who!
