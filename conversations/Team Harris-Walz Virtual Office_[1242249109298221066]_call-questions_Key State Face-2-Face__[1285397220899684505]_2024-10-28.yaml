  content: Hi, I'm a 70 y/o psychologist in CA.  I've canvassed locally many times...but
    don't we need people to reach out to voters (especially older voters) Face-to-Face
    in battle ground states?  I would be willing to travel to do so.  Are there volunteer
    groups for this purpose?  Thanks

    Democratic parties for battleground states and our <#1268426751164551199> thread
    here on the server. Hope that helped, Dr. B!

  content: Hi Dr. B. I found https://www.mobilize.us/ to be very helpful in finding
    ways to help in key states. You can filter by state, city, etc. I live in New
    York City but found ways to help in Pennsylvania.
