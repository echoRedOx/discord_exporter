  content: "OK.  Just spent (way) too long on the phone with someone who isn\u2019\
    t going to vote but every issue he brought up was pro Harris and anti Trump. \
    \ I wanted to send him the kamalaharris.com link but wasn\u2019t given the opportunity\
    \ in the dialer.  I tagged him \u201Cnot voting\u201D and then \u201Cundecided\u201D\
    \ on the next screen, but it didn\u2019t give me a link to provide additional\
    \ information.  Did I miss something?"

  content: Some scripts have a link to text, others do not.  Your selections are right
    and in this case it would be up to him to visit the issues page on his own.  I
    hope your conversation convinced him to reconsider not voting.  Its mindboggling
    right?

  content: COMPLETELY!  His biggest concern was that the government makes decisions
    without input from the electorate!  And he mentioned the 1%ers and homelessness,
    etc.  I'm so worried for this country!  Thanks Denise!!!  Back to calling and
    texting...
