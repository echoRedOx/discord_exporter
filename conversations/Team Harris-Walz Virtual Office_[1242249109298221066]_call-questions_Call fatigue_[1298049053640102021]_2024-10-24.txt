Content: I've gotten a couple people who have expressed call fatigue - most of them Strong harris and didn't mind chatting with me again, but this one call was very hostile, said it was rude to call during dinner and said both parties were out of control with advertising and texts and calls making him angry and now he wouldn't vote for either. I put him on the do not call and apologized but does anyone else have suggestions?

Content: I tell people that as soon as their votes are counted, they will be dropped off of call lists.
