Content: Hi <@1269872908759597148> - Thank you! I just saw the Inbox DM so I will go through those. I am new to Discord and it seems even busier than Slack in terms of channels and options (granted my Slack usage is all for much smaller groups and projects without so much going on).  I opened the Inbox it just seemed to have more general announcements but I see the "For You" section now.  I hope to at least be able to reach a few people in the next week. I am happy that this Discord is so busy with so many engaged people... just hope it translates to votes!
