  content: I do that too. Sometimes I'll mix it up and say somethign like <"Kamala
    is queen." Okay, if this ocmes out weird, it's becuase I'm on my chromebook and
    the keyboard is so tiny. UGH!

  content: I have a question and maybe someone can answer this for me. Some people
    tell me that the coconut emoji can be considered slightly racist since some say
    it's you're one race on the outside but another on the inside. Does anyone know
    about this? I never heard of this but I also don't use a lot of emojis because
    I just never did.

  content: Someone- who is French and not on social media a lot said that to me but
    when I explained the CONTEXT (remember- we all exist in the context , etc) and
    where it originated- from her speech- they totally understood. I suggest using
    the coconut and the palm tree together to avoid confusion...

  content: Thanks for the clarification, everyone. I'm mixed race just like Kamala
    (in my case it's I'm white and Native American) so I also try not to be disrespectful
    of other's cultures so I was wondering about this but you all helped me greatly
    understand it.
