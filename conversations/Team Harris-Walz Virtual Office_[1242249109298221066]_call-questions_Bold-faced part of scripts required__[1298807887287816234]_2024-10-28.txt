Content: New guy here: tonight will be my first time trying the "What is important to you?" question before asking who they are voting for. For the last 5 days I've done this, the script either hasn't had that part, or else I have just (erroneously) skipped it. Is the main goal to find out who they are voting for? In which case, I could just go back to my "Hi my name is Pat, I'm a volunteer with Team Harris-Walz supporting Democrats in AZ, I know you're busy and I don't want to take but a few seconds of your time to ask if you are planning to vote this election, and if so, will you be supporting Kamala Harris for president?" I am happy to say whatever I need to -- I was just trying to avoid hangups by being succinct. Thanks.

Content: Thanks for being here Patrick! The main purpose is to engage voters.
1. Help ensure supporters they know how/where/when to vote, and if they can volunteer. 
2. Listen to unsupported/lean Trump on what issues are important to them and try to persuade them to vote for Harris by sharing why **you** are supporting the campaign.
3. Weed out strong Trump/MAGA voters OFF our lists with the Refused/Hostile tag or STRONG Trump when applicable.

Content: Cool, I guess it's more a tactical question about how best to keep someone on the line -- Do you recommend I go with the "What is most important to you this election?" question before jumping into the question, "Will you be supporting Kamala Harris?"

Content: Honestly, I base which one I say on their level of enthusiasm in their voice up to that point. If they seem uninterested, annoyed, or similar, I jump right into Will you be supporting Kamala Harris? If not those emotions, I will typically try to engage.
