  content: 'Hi <@666870822836895745> the event you signed up for should provide the
    next steps, some are very last-minute and you may only hear on the day of the
    event. Something like this

    "*Each volunteer will be given a list of 45 to 60 doors to do for the day on their
    own. We just ask you to pick up the literature/voter guide and turf at the designated
    time. PLEASE NOTE: AT THIS LOCATION YOU MUST SIGN UP BY 7 PM THE NIGHT BEFORE."*
