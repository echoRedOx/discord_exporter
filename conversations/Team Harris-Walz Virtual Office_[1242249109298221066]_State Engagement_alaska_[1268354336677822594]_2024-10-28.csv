I have been seeing your posts in Harris for Alaska. You wouldn't happen to be a translator would you? I have a local source I was told I could ask, but I thought I may ask you first. I had spoken to Robyn Niayuq Burke about some of the local issues that they had been experiencing and also had read about the DOJ being present because a language issues. I know its a long shoot but I thought I would ask. I just assumed that would not have an Inupiaq or Yup‚Äôik translator here. She did suggest Yup'ik would be the best for translated content."

It's also incredibly important that we make sure that people with mail in ballots have gotten their ballots and understand how to return them. This is such important work, and we have to close strong. But we can't make our 10 million call goal without your help. If you're experienced, you can go straight to our dialer [here ](https://democrats.call.scaletowin.com/?t=933f666e-c699-46e3-ac92-12d9cf6f3992) - if you're new, please join us over in <#1242256751445934262> to get connected to some training! (If you don't have that, go to  <id:customize>  and choose ""talk to voters in key states."") Even making a few calls helps. Many hands make light work. Will you please come over and join us?"
