Monday night was where Chelsea Clinton spoke. I found media reports saying there were over 120k people on this call. 
The other call was already last Tuesday with about 200k women joining.

Perhaps the speakers WERE talking about two different calls.  I stayed on later than I thought I would to hear Chelsea Clinton.  The numbers of attendees, the $$$s raised, the NEW voter registrations (especiallly from young people) ... it's all amazing.  I have so much hope and confidence that we can get it right this time."
