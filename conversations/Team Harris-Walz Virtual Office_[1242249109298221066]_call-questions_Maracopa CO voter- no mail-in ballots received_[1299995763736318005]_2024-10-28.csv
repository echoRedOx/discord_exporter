If this happens again, please verbally direct the voter to contact the state's voter assistance hotline. The number should be on the righthand side bar on the script, but you can always ask here on Discord or in your Zoom chat if you're on the phonebank if you can't find it! Thank you so much. Arizona hotline number is 833-868-3429"
