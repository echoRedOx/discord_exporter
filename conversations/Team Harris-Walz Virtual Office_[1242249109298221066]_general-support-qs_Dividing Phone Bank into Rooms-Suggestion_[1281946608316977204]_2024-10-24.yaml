  content: "Hello! Was Data Captain on a call that needed to be separated into experienced\
    \ callers for one call link and new callers for the other. Experienced callers\
    \ were asked to type \u201Cexperienced\u201D or a phone icon in the chat. These\
    \ popped in amongst icebreaker and tech questions making it a slow process to\
    \ move them into the correct room. Going forward could we ask them to raise hand\
    \ in zoom instead of using chat to identify?"

  content: <@1270562171050266725> This is something a team can discuss during the
    opening meeting before we start the zoom. Honestly, I feel like having them rename
    themselves to start with an E or an N would help us identify. Honestly, though,
    this sound slike when we initially have experienced callers put the phone icon
    in the chat for the dialer link, which doesn't require us to do anything other
    than post the dialer link.

  content: I would suggest bringing it up at the beginning of your next session to
    come to a consensus on how to handle it for your meeting. Everyone is starting
    to come up with their personal preferences and best practices.
