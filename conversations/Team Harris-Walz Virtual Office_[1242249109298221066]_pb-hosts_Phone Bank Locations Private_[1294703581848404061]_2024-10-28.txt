Content: <@1290146855417675778>  - It looks like you named the event as a cafe, but it seems like a private, small space.  Either way, we usually send the address only to people who RSVP.  Thanks again.

Content: we're you or Jeannine M able to make the requested changes to my Sunday phonebanks and delete any other phonebanks that were created outside of our Sunday, 2-4 events?

Content: Hi again, <@782870341445353522>  and <@1266879741785538682> .  I went on the Mobilize event page and found the event listed below which was created as a PHONEBANK but it should be listed as a Post-Card  writing campaign! üòµ‚Äçüí´  Can you please edit this as a Post Card writing event instead of deleting it?

Content: Also, <@1290146855417675778> are you saying all of your events are not phone banks? If so, you will need to delete them. We don't officially host postcard parties through the campaign but you can set up your own event

Content: Here's an article on changing events. This speaks to deleting events, which you mentioned you want to do, but also shows you how to access the dashboard where you can make other changes you'd like

Content: No, only the the events listed Thurs-Sunday from 12-4 are NOT phonebanks.  The Sunday events from 2-4 pm ARE phonebanks.  And I have logged onto Mobilize to edit the events and it won't let me change anything.  All it lets me do is email my registered guests.  I have emailed the organizers to ask how to make changes but  no one has responded to me

Content: <@782870341445353522>   I believe the events were created by Paula Robinson Deare and her email address is prdeare@eworkstyle.com.  I have recently made contact with her so I will see if she can make the changes and if not, I will get back to you.  Sorry for all the confusion.  I appreciate your patience.
