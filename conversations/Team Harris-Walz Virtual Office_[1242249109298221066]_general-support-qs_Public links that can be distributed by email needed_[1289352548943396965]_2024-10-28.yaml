  content: Both the <#1252676126698897429> and <#1250876565366243348> are excellent,
    but I need links to send in email, so they can have a wider reach.  How to do
    this? As it is now, if a I copy a link, the reader has to log in at Discord. That's
    no good and counter productive.

    the that is was approved.

    in the email.  Send the email to myself, clicked on the URL in the received email,
    and it goes to the image on Discord, so that method doesn't work for people who
    don't have Discord accounts.

  content: The only way I can use the <#1252676126698897429> posts is to click on
    the link, which takes me to "X", whereupon I can right-click on the post (a video),
    copy the link, and then paste it into my email.  Unfortunately, I won't use "X",
    as Muskrat has demonstrated his hypocrisy , facist tendencies, AND supports Trump.   I
    haven't a clue why you folks decided on using "X"??
