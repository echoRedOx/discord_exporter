The new map is so crazy (Shreveport is now divided into two districts) I would wager there are thousands across the state who don't even know they're in the new one.  But I'm also concerned about the lack of publicity for the Democratic candidates - particularly Cleo Fields who the state Democratic party is apparently supporting for the seat.  Has anyone in northwest Louisiana seen or heard anything?  It's vital Kamala has a Demoratic-majority Congress!

The Harris-Walz campaign is focused on a swing state strategy so most official efforts and investment are geared towards GA, NC, AZ, PA, MI, WI, NV. One thing I learned during Gov Edwards‚Äô reelection campaign is that so much activity is driven at the grassroots/volunteer level which is why the campaign set us up with this platform here. I‚Äôve connected with students at Tulane and have been focused on encouraging voter registration via vote.org. The great thing about vote.org is that by going to that single site, you can get registered in any state. We can encourage students from the swing states listed above (along with Florida which has a competitive Senate race) to register in their home state. Ultimately, students have the choice to register where they are residing for school or in their home state. I think that could be a great first step for the college students."
