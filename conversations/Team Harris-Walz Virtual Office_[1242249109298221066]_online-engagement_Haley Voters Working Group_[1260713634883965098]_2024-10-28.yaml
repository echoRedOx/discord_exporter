  content: <@941196169852366859>  None of the Republican politicians who are endorsing
    Biden in 2024 have stepped up to resurrect Republicans For Biden-Harris.  So to
    me, none are willing to be outcasts from the GOP.

  content: They need to. Of course with some of them like Christie, the Dems in their
    state keep reminding them that they kissed Trump's backside for years so there's
    also that whole thing. Also, as someone orginally from NJ who still lives near
    the state (I'm outside of Philadelphia, PA now), I can tell you that no one listens
    to Chris Christie half the time anyway there...not since Bridgegate.

    apparently targeted to PA's Republicans for Biden.  By the way, Haley got her
    RNCC speaking spot to continue her career.
