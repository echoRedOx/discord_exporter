Content: I went to local chapter events for the first time ever last week and it was great. Being an American watching the depressing stuff we've observed over the past few years (DJT, J6, terrible SCOTUS decisions) has felt lonely, and through the local chapter I got to meet a lot of other Americans who understand the experience and are plugged into efforts to do something about it. I really needed that.

Content: I tried to use s---show instead of "stuff" but got censored by the server ... here in Germany one sees that word in newspaper headlines so I forgot we can be a little more sensitive about swear words ðŸ˜‚

Content: yes i know what you mean about the loneliness, being abroad makes one feel kind of powerless like you're watching a train crash. So it would be good to get nvolved in something. The local chapter is not super near me but I will make an effort to attend some events at some point ( and do online volunteering)
