  content: Hi <@1296461685216772170> - thanks so much for the work you are doing!
    Unfortunately, we cannot take their personal info down from phonebanks and we
    cannot call them back or have anyone from the campaign call them back. It's just
    not allowed. With a week + to go I am sure he will end up getting called again...and
    maybe mind will be changed? It sounds like it was at least not a hostile conversation.
