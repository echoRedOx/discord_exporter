Just in case, I am going to DM you the shadow debrief form. In my experience helping a few folks, some people get the regular phone bank form and the shadow form confused as they are similar. I do not see KC permissions added yet, so there may just be a delay in getting your debrief form processed.  Will check in via DM shortly.  Thanks again, Jay"
