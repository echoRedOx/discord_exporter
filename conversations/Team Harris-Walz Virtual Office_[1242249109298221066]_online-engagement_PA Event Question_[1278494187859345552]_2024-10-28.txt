Content: Hi <@1253874228793573417>. Thanks for volunteering with us this evening. We're so glad you're here. I don't have any specific information about that to share here in the Online Engagement channels, however you may find a moderator with that answer in <#1267941954243526756>. In the past, I have heard that SOME of the rallies were posted on Moblize.us for people to sign up to attend. However, I can't confirm that. Thanks again.
