An option to see them all in one place would be super helpful.

That way you create a concise “one stop shop” and can avoid all the back and forth between browser, inbox, texts… just thought I’d share since it’s one less thing to worry about when scheduling for more events. Also helps me avoid double booking by accident or messing up the time zones. <:bidenpointq:1251648410902069351> 😁"
