  content: Am doing postcard outreach for OH and TX, but would also love to help do
    something in WV.  At some point, the Democratic Party needs to stop ignoring our
    state - we are fertile ground for Dem politics, but there is literally nowhere
    to get any info from anyone on volunteering in any way here.  It is a sad state
    of affairs in the Mountain State in terms of dem politics these days.

  content: I hear you, thats why I'm trying to start something here even tho I live
    in VA. Can you join me in identifying who else from WV is here and we can start
    making a plan. I'm currently reaching out to some friends and trying to see if
    I can find if there is anything at all going on that I can connect you to. I have
    been looking for about an hour and have not found anything. This means we may
    need to start with inviting people to join this virtual office. I can start reaching
    out to folks who are organizing in places close to WV, would you be able to invite
    other WV who would be receptive so we can have both a team coming in and a team
    to help meet people where they are. Ill go knocking on doors with you/whatever
    you think would be best received by folks who may not want to canvass but may
    be receptive to our message.

    with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from
    all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and
    MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks
    is crucial.
