    \ in Discord are from Twitter. Every time Twitter launches in the app the sound\
    \ is muted. I looked online and and also in the app help can\u2019t find a solution\
    \ and wondered if someone could help."

  content: Hi Joyce, are you using Twitter on iOS or Android? And are you trying to
    listen to videos posted on Twitter, or are you trying to listen to Twitter Spaces.
    If you aren't sure that's fine too.

  content: Twitter default it mute, I think so it doesn't disturb folks in public.
    You can unmute by tapping on the lower-right corner of any video. I am looking
    for an automatic way to do this in the app.

  content: Sorry I can't find a way to make the audio play automatically, it would
    also be messy if there were two videos in your viewable area at one time.
