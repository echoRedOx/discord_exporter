Content: Not sure if this is the right place to put this: I've been using Reach to survey friends and family. The two issues that come up 90% of the time are stopping Trump and reproductive rights, but neither is in the list of issues. Is there a reason for that? Will it change any time soon? (hope this doesn't sound unpleasant, I think you are all doing an amazing job!!) Thanks.

Content: There should be information on reproductive rights in the library.

Content: I wasn't clear. In Reach there are tags for issues the person cares about, but no tags for reproductive rights or preserving democracy which are the two I get most often. Thanks!
