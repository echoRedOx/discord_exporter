They thought they updated their voter registration, but aren‚Äôt sure. Reach app still has old address & voting info. Can I update it somehow to get their current voting precincts etc? They‚Äôre a strong Harris supporter, but an infrequent voter. Trying to encourage them to get out and vote. Thanks!"

Bummer. I'll have to hunt down their voting precinct information by hand then. I'm pretty sure that if I tell them where to go and when it's open, they'll go out and vote when they otherwise wouldn't. Thank you so much for taking time to hunt down info for me!"
