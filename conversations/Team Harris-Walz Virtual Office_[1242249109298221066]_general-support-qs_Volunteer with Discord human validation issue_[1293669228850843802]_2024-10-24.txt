Content: The Text Team has a contact who is volunteering for the campaign that is experiencing issues trying to set up an account in Discord: "I keep getting an error when they ask me to verify that I am human." Suggestions?

Content: Hi <@1260638482905436180>  I haven't see this before, but I can meet the volunteer on zoom to look at what's going on. You can tell them to email carbrn@gmail.com and make sure email clearly identifies them as a volunteer for the campaign.
