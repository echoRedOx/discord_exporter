  content: Hi Frances. I'm trying to find out about next steps for being a Text Moderator.
    I was one in 2020. I took the training for it for this year and filled out required
    forms, etc. But I am not sure where to keep an eye out for next steps. Can you
    help? (I posted about this in text-team-welcome but it seems to have been removed?)
    Thanks!
