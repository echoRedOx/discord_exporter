Content: Hi, the host said to get back on the zoom call at 2:50 for the wrap up, I am trying to connect but Iâ€™m still waiting to be let in the room. Can someone let me into the call?

Content: Well about an hour in people started to ask about parking and asked if there was still parking available. Iâ€™ve tried to park in Atlanta and itâ€™s a mess, I didnâ€™t want to tell people there was or wasnâ€™t parking available so I asked on here.
No one answered until 3 minutes before the phone bank ended (while I was trying to get on the zoom) so I didnâ€™t make any more calls.

I canâ€™t remember what the script said exactly, but a lot of it was very wordy so I trimmed some down because I could tell people didnâ€™t want to be on the phone too long.
Additionally, the dialer was kind of slow, typically took 30 seconds to a minute to connect to a call.

Content: Sorry to be critical about the scripts, I used to write call scripts for Our Revolution and the Bernie campaign.

Content: Hi, thank you for sharing your experience (and apologies for not answering your parking question earlier) and your feedback! As to the script, it often can be super clunky so you did the right thing in cutting it down, which you are 100% welcome to do! And yeah, the dialer is a lot slower when there's not a ton of people making calls.
