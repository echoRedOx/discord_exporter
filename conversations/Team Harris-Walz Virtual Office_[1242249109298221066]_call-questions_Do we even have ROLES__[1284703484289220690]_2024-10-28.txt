Content: Like it sure would be helpful to be able to tag <#1268378299428634727> or @Texas to notify those.

Also maybe language speakers, cause Spanish be good. Women/Men should also be there.

Also, we need a Beto O’rourke proxy here

Content: Hi <@482311755855429653>, I'm happy to answer any questions I can or point you in the right direction if I don't have the answers you seek. Regarding Roles, are you seeking to get involved in another capacity with the team? The feedback in your question, was that intended for the debrief on a phonebank yesterday?

Content: It wasn’t. All I know is that this group should have a focus for how to mobilize in social media. If common states or their relationship to a person’s family can’t get attention, ultimately this discord kind of fails to reach its potential.

Content: Maybe roles is not the proper term here. In a former discord, basically people would go to a specific tab and ask for what they want to be notified about.

Then mods of the server assign that to their profile and when another person uses the @______ ALL others with that would be notified.

50 states are a must. 
Policies are second.

Like if I were to post an excellent meme or a good video or a good Tik Tok, we want as many people watching it as possible.

People with friends will see it and then they can be persuaded if undecided.

Content: Like I am from Texas, I want to know when people post an @texas because we don’t want Ted Cruz. This isn’t just about Harris Walz even though that is our prime goal. There are a lot of Congress members on the ballot and we want to get them elected.

I am new to THIS discord for sure. Haven’t used it in a while, but I am not new at all. Things work differently from one to one.

Content: As for your other original questions: 
The campaign has a 2x/weekly *PRIORITY* volunteer event called Latinos Con Kamala Phone Bank making bilingual calls to voters! Per a fellow KC in <#1268378299428634727> chat, Eva Longoria was the surprise guest last night! You can sign up to join here: https://events.democrats.org/event/647512/

There are plenty of volunteers who also work with Beto's PXP (I'm one of them!) but there are strict campaign finance laws we have to abide by as this Discord is specifically for Harris For President. I recommend checking out PXP's website for events & info on how to get involved!

Happy volunteering!
