  content: "HQ staff: the shift from cold calls to rally support calls drastically\
    \ and favorably shifted the mood in some of the shifts I've helped staff. The\
    \ former have a higher rate of hang-ups and tough conversations, whereas the latter\
    \ have a much lower rate of challenging interactions. \n\nPerhaps consider pivoting\
    \ colld calls to rally support calls in the last 20 minutes to make calls more\
    \ rewarding for volunteers. I'd happily explain the behavioral principles behind\
    \ why this might help enhance the experience for phone bank volunteers (e.g.,\
    \ ending shifts on higher notes for more people, capitalizing on recency bias,\
    \ etc.).\n\nI don't know how hard that would be to implement. Just a thought."

  content: Great idea, <@891758018478366741> ! I know that those rally confirmation
    calls are so uplifting for our phone bank volunteers. I've forwarded your suggestion
    to staff so they can keep it in mind. Thanks!! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>

  content: <@891758018478366741> Thank you for suggesting this, I like this idea.
    Unfortunately, we pivot lists due to demand from our directors. We have a project
    manager who identifies where the need is for calls and as organizers we follow
    their instructions. I do recognize the behavioral dynamics of ending on a high,
    and will bring this up with my superiors to see how realistic this is.

  content: "Fantastic. \n\nHere are some ideas for discussing with leadership the\
    \ idea of embracing the added challenge of ending shift calls, when possible,\
    \ with 20 mins of rally support calls, which may leave volunteers on a positive\
    \ note that may boost volunteer engagement and satisfaction, leading to:\n\n-\
    \ Increased retention: Volunteers are more likely to return if they have positive\
    \ experiences.\n- Improved morale: Ending on a high can combat burnout and create\
    \ a sense of accomplishment.\n- Enhanced productivity: Positive experiences can\
    \ motivate volunteers to perform better during their shifts.\n- Positive word-of-mouth:\
    \ Satisfied volunteers are likelier to recommend the experience to others.\n\n\
    While the proposed change may add some complexity, the potential long-term benefits\
    \ outweigh the short-term costs. Happy volunteers are essential for a successful\
    \ campaign, and this small adjustment may make a big difference. \n\nThanks so\
    \ much! Onward..."
