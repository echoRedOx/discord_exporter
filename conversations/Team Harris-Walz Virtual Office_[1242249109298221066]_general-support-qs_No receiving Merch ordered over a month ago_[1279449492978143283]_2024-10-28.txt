Content: Same -- no stuff and not even showing up on the account. I agree that there may be high volume and they just didn't have enough.

Content: Same here.  My shirts said they would be ready the following week, but that was 3+ weeks ago. Kinda bummed about that. I got my Deadheads for Kamala shirt within 3 days of my donation there.

Content: I ordered a poster and buttons in early August. Still say awaiting fulfillment. IF it was anything like Hillary's campaign, we'll get them in early October. I think going from Biden to Harris overwhelmed them and they haven't recovered.

Content: Kind of figured that. I'm hoping that I get at least by October. Going from Biden to Harris-mania within a week or so must have pretty much broken the supply chain. I will think of it as a donation if nothing else.

Content: I haven't received 3 orders but I did receive 2 texts today that they've been "hard at work to keep up with the high demand & to get your order into your hands! We are working to fulfill these orders as quickly as possible & will follow up when we have updates. Thank you again for your patience & understanding." An hour later I received an email with the same wording.

Content: Thanks all for the updates. Going from 0 to 100% interest in a week def. overwhelmed them. I'm sure most items bought in August will be mailed at least at the end of Sept. or early Oct.
