Content: I thought the Dawn Til Dusk campaign meant you can jump on anytime? I just selected Make Calls Now and nothing happened. I was able to schedule a time for later (one hr from now). Do I really need to wait?

Content: Shannon, thanks for jumping on.  There was a glitch with the Mobilize system, but I think it is fixed now, though it may take a minute to connect you.  Please give it a try and come back if it doesn't work.

Content: Hi Shannon, you have two options when signing up to call for Dawn Til Dusk: make calls then or schedule a time.  If you're ready to make calls right then, be sure to click the Start Making Calls Now button:

Content: I did this on both Safari and Chrome and it is not working for Make Calls Now. I just get a greyed out anti sign.
