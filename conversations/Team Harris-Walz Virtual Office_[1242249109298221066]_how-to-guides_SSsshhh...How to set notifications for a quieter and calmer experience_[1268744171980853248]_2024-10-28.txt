Content: You can change your personal push notification settings for each category (the top-level sections in the sidebar with carrots that look like this: > Community >Level Up >Calls Team > Text Team, etc. 

To change notifications, right click (laptop) or tap and hold (mobile/tablet) the Category name. Click or tap "Mute Category" and select your preferred option. For maximum quiet, select "Until I turn it back on" or select your preferred option.

Next, click or tap "Notification Settings". You can turn all notifications OFF by clicking or tapping "Nothing".  If you select @ mentions you will still receive push notifications when you or your roles are mentioned/tagged. 

You now have your preferred notifications set for all channels in the category and you've muted the category. 

These settings can help manage overwhelm. 

You can also right click or press and hold a category, then select "Mark as Read" to dismiss bold channels that show up when new messages are present. If you're still seeing channels in bold, you can quiet them by muting the category or the specific channel. 

Let us know if you have questions on these features!

Content: Notification settings can also help you sleep (or work) if you want to do those things during times when the community is very active.

Content: "each category (the top-level sections in the sidebar " what does this mean? Is it for each channel? Is there an icon to look for?

Content: There are little angle brackets by them, they are kind of like folders that contain channels for that category. ðŸ˜‰ You can click on the angle bracket to view or hide the channels under that category. 

We've now turned off messaging here to keep this page "view only" but if anyone has further questions, please ask your friendly, neighborhood mods in <#1242249109298221069> or you can post your question to <#1267941954243526756>.
