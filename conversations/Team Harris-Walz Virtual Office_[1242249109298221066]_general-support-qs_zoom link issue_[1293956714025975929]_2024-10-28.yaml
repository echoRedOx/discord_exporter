  content: Hope I'm in the right place...when I click on the zoom link for 11:00 phone
    bank, it brings me to the zoom page and the dialog with "open link." but when
    i click that, it goes nowhere. I made sure to open zoom and sign in on  my account
    and tried again, but the same thing. any suggestions?

  content: 'hmm... trying to click around on my end and figure this out... if anything,
    I would try shutting down zoom completely and restarting it (+login) before clicking
    the link again.


    Or it could be that the link is broken (I''ve done that by accident on the other
    end of phonebanks, oops.)'

    two after it tries to run program updates.
