Content: On mobilize.us you can sort using the filters. People sign up on the same site. Unfortunately, I don't know where there is just an appearance schedule for just the leaders.  I imagine that information is sparsed out for security concerns. I was responsible for George HW Bush's visit to Disney (yeah, LONG time ago) and I couldn't even tell my husband what I was doing.

Content: I signed up for the Vegas rally on Saturday because that's where I live they don't have the location or the time so I guess we wait till the last minute which is definitely understandable

Content: Awesome that ya'll are able to go to rallies in person. The locations have been last minute for security reasons. I would love to see more airport rallies, so cool when they pull up in a big plane.

Content: So far rally info has been last minute. I encourage your neice to reach out to her local area democratic offices since this the tour says this stop will visit "volunteer canvass events".
