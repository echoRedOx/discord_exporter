Being an American watching the depressing stuff we've observed over the past few years (DJT, J6, terrible SCOTUS decisions) has felt lonely, and through the local chapter I got to meet a lot of other Americans who understand the experience and are plugged into efforts to do something about it. I really needed that."

So it would be good to get nvolved in something. The local chapter is not super near me but I will make an effort to attend some events at some point ( and do online volunteering)"
