Does that exist somewhere here or in Reach? Thanks!"

I haven't seen a list but I'll check to see if such a thing exists or can be created. In the meantime, you can get a general idea by looking at the events and actions posted on events.democrats.org as most of those have start and end times. Hope that helps!"

The *training* is one hour, after that your friends do it on their own time, whenever they want. Call Banking is two hour group sessions, encourage your friends to sign up for one session, they will enjoy the vibe so much they'll want to come back for more."

And we only do like 2 hours of shifts and that includes a debrief and a short training. Text banking would be when we have campaigns. So it depends.
