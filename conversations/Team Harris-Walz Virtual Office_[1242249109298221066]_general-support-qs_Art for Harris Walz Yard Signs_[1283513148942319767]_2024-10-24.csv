I also have a sign making company I can use to make bulk quantities, but I would like to use official graphics (18' X 24"") with the recently updated font and that brilliant blue. I can't seem to find a website or person who can provide me with the art file that I can use with the printer.   I am willing to pay about $365 for 50 signs with wire stands to give signs to those voters. All I need is the official graphics. Otherwise, I have to create my own unofficial graphics. Here are low-res photos of official signs, although I'd prefer to use the brighter brilliant blue if possible. Can anybody point me to somebody in the campaign who has the art files for these signs?"

You might try going to the Reach library and searching ""sign"" it will give you a lot of sign images that were made for social media use. One of those (might need cropping) but could be better than a low res photo."

So they aren't going to be supportive of you getting the signs printed elsewhere."

As a non-employee (I am a volunteer), I am spending my time and money (by working fewer hours at my job) so that I can spread messages, memes, graphics and articles across my 15+ social media groups as part of the online engagement team. So how is that different from me paying for my own physical signs to give to voters who are willing to put the signs in their yards? In fact, isn't it my First Amendment right to use my own resources (time and money) to make signs or my own voice to promote anybody or anything I want? No campaign money is involved; just my money and time. Is there any kind of org chart for the entire campaign organization so I can find a legal dept person to make sure I am not violating any campaign laws by making my own unofficial signs (with a note saying something like  ""Privately funded by Joe Carr, not provided by the Harris Walz campaign""). Also, if there is a campaign org chart, is there a group that deals with the production and sale of merchandise and signs? Maybe they could help me. Thank you for your replies!!"

This is official campaign material, and printing them without having paid for them has the potential to be a legal nightmare for all parties involved given copyright law and intellectual property rules. You are free to use unofficial material you find on Reach, or even design your own, but these can not be used as they are. I'm going to go ahead and delete the images.
