  content: "Most folks I\u2019ve been getting on my calls have been only able to talk\
    \ very very briefly and using a script seems like it\u2019s just gonna turn them\
    \ off and I can\u2019t call it up, etc. quickly enough what if people found to\
    \ be very effective in these circumstances? It seems like people just don\u2019\
    t have time to talk and listen to much at all or they\u2019ll just hang up."

  content: "It\u2019s OK to adapt the script a bit to what works for you.  It\u2019\
    s required that you say you\u2019re a volunteer (for Dems etc) and that you review\
    \ the script to understand the purpose of the call and convey that.  But you don\u2019\
    t have to use the exact phrasing in the exact order and most callers personalize\
    \ a bit and ad lib a bit as well.  Just please remember to stay positive and that\
    \ people will associate you with Team Harris.\n\nIf you want to mention this in\
    \ the <#1242256751445934262> channel, others will likely jump in and tell you\
    \ how they personally work with this dilemma."

  content: "But yes, definitely shorten and get straight to the point if that\u2019\
    s what gets the job done!  Just remember to say you\u2019re a volunteer, stay\
    \ positive, and know the goals of the call (like to recruit volunteers or to get\
    \ out the vote).  Good luck!"
