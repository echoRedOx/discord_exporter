Content: When calling about the Atlanta event, we tell them about the free parking available. I had an attendee ask me if there is still parking available. Do we know? Is there any way to know? Will we be able to find out when they run out of parking so we don’t tell them it’s available? Sounds like a lot of people are going!

Content: Hi! Unfortunately, we don't know if there is still parking available as we don't have that information.
