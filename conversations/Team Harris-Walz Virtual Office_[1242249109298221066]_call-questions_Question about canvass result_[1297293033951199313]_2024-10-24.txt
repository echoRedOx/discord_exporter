Content: Hi, someone just said, “I don’t want to talk right now” and I’m not sure if I should list that as a “Refused or Hostile” or “Busy/Call Back.” They didn’t seem hostile but they also didn’t say to call back later.

Content: That's a great question! I think that could go either way, but the "right now" is perhaps a key indicator that they would be willing to talk at another time. I would select "busy/call back" here.
