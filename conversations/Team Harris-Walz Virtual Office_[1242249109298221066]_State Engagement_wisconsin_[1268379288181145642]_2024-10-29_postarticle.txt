Content: At the moment, I'm unemployed, so I've been pondering an idea.  

I want to take a tour around Wisconsin, doing campaign stuff.  

Putting post-its everywhere, handing out my "Who should I vote for?" worksheets, setting up a "Ask me why I'm voting Harris-Walz" table at different places.  

Do you think this is a good idea or dangerous?

Content: I’m trying to ignore what I just realized of being here in a community that is called Discord, which means, “disagreement between people” or “lack of agreement or harmony : conflict. discord between political parties”

My question, why would a platform (APP) be named something that completely contradicts Kamala’s message?  A bit concerning.  Don’t like what the name represents.  Not the best choice!

Content: But it’s been promoted to those wanting to get involved during the digital training sessions, so I assumed it was an official campaign resource.  Thanks for clarifying.

The name contradicts community and getting along with people.  Don’t like it.

Content: 😂  thank you for being conscientious about the fundraising and links. I know it's another layer of effort, but it makes it so much easier on the mods. We hate taking down links to these super cool events and asking y'all to edit posts. But we would hate giving the other side any fodder for accusing us of misconduct in this election even more. 
Appreciate you <@1274293080794595339> - keep up the good work 💪

Content: I gave the details to my friend and she went. She mentioned people were turned away at the door. She said the place was packed and she felt hopeful in a way she had not felt “in many years.” 

It sounded similar to the Milwaukee one in August which was incredible. They gave out the same bracelets and signs. I heard that Tammy Baldwin and a local Union leader spoke.

Content: I'm a CA resident that is interested in moving to WI for the final month of the campaign to help organize. I can pay my own way to get to wherever I will be most helpful to the campaign, but I was hoping there might be another volunteer or member of the campaign that has a spare room that I could stay at while I volunteer. Please let me know (in DMs) if anyone can help connect me with the right person!

Content: Required disclaimer: DNC officially recommends I Will Vote dot com for all voter info.  Had to remove the dot gov links but the text below comes from a volunteer with local knowledge of on the ground process in WI as a poll worker. 

For registration, you can register anytime up to and including election day at the polls. 
If you choose to register online (the easiest method, provided you have the prerequisites to do it): That ends on October 16, but you can always register at the clerks office or at the polls on election day.

Early in person voting in Wisconsin begins Oct 22. Mail-in absentee ballot request deadline is Oct 31. Ballot drop boxes are again legal in Wisconsin, but not all municipalities are using them - check with their municipal clerk.

Content: I was a bit too shocked to reply that a) non-citizens aren't allowed to vote anywhere in WI and b) That The Heritage Foundation’s analysis of legal actions regarding election conduct found only 24 instances of noncitizens voting between 2003 and 2023. A study conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice analyzing 23.5 million votes across 42 jurisdictions in the 2016 general election concluded that there were approximately 30 instances of noncitizens casting votes. Illegal voting, including by noncitizens, is routinely investigated and prosecuted by the appropriate authorities, and there is no evidence that noncitizen voting has ever been significant enough to impact an election’s outcome.

Content: Politico is right-wing crap now, but they've run an article about the Green Party's presence in WI that *might* be worth reading for intel and insights from Dem leaders that you don't already have. Remember that Stein had lunch with Mike Flynn and Putin, got help from Trump-aligned lawyers to stay on the ballot this cycle, and is generally uninformed about even the basics of US govt. Happy to share sources of info if you run into Stein voters and think you can sway them. https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/03/wisconsin-green-party-00180283

Content: Hi! Long shot but I signed up to canvass today at noon <somewhere nearby> (Madison WI)— I signed up over the phone so I’m not totally sure what event though, just canvassing & sounded door to door. If any organizers are here and see this, and you had a late signup on Thursday- hi 👋 that might be me! Let me know where to go if you see this before noon. 

Otherwise I’ll just pick the closest event and hope it’s helping more than it causes chaos 😅

Content: Interesting article about Wisconsin’s undecideds. It seems like there are still some “double haters” - though way fewer than earlier in the year. We just need to find those folks and assuage whatever concerns they have about Kamala.

Content: Hey friends, four years ago, we sent President Biden to the White House with one of the largest popular vote margins in history, thanks to support from all 50 states, blue and red alike. A bigger margin makes it harder for Trump and MAGA Republicans to challenge the election. The work we do in these last two weeks is crucial.

**Happy first day of early voting!**

(Or “In Person Absentee Voting”, cuz we’re quirky…) Who’s voting today? Let’s turn out ourselves and our friends so the campaign can spend all their resources on people who are less plugged in! 

Which are you!

Content: I pulled the turnout data from the state election commission and at least 475,460 people have voted already, either with mail in ballots or yesterday when at least 97,436 voted early in person. I say at least because there can be data entry delays. That is 10.17% of the 2022 voting age population (4,676,183) that has already voted so far.

Good work, gang.

Content: Hang ups are common, but look at it this way; the more calls we complete, the more Harris supporters we can help with casting their ballot!

Content: Hey folks, Chicagoan here.  BLUF: Where should I take my friends to canvass this weekend (both days)? I.e. who needs our help the most?

Long story long: we've canvassed for local candidates in Chicago, as well as in Kenosha and Racine, WI for big democrat the past couple of weekends. We can drive as far as Kalamazoo or Battle Creek Michigan, or anything in that range into Michigan or Wisconsin. This weekend we were redirected from Kenosha to Racine because they had enough volunteers there, which got me thinking there might be places a bit further in that need us more.  If you know a county in need of help whose office I should reach out to let me know and I'll give them a holler.
