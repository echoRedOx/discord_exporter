Content: How do I change my role? I ended up in online engagement, but I'm not really social media savvy. How do I switch my role to something like back office volunteering or data entry or postcards? Thanks!

Content: Hi Kerry! Just go back to <id:customize> <click/tap here and deselect/select the roles you prefer. Vote Team is the best place for data entry type work. We do not have a team doing postcards at this time. Thank you!

Content: <@957714233217409174> I'm looking for data entry/analysis tasks as well. I signed up for Data Captain training for this Wed. night. But on Channels & Roles I don't see an option for Vote Team.

Content: All teams except Online Engagement and Hosts require everyone take a training first (sign up for an event at the links in general chat or on https://events.democrats.org) then there's a process to be approved to access each team's channels in this server. So you'll get access instructions in your training essentially! Very soon! Almost there!
