They have linked a news article from CNN fact checking VP  Harris on Project 2025 not even really pertaining to the video. The odd thing is this - CNN article is using MARY VOUGHT. She runs Vought Strategies and is married to RUSSELL VOUGHT. I do not think CNN is trustworthy. This woman is also the PR for my Governor and has ruined my states community.

“We understand the excitement and interest here, but VP Harris has made no decision on a running mate yet!,” he said in a post on X.

Munoz was responding to a local report that said Harris had made her decision and that her running mate has accepted.

CNN reported earlier that Harris is focusing on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter, although the process, these sources cautioned, is still fluid and none of the finalists can be ruled out until Harris makes her decision.

Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly remained in the running as of Monday afternoon, a source told CNN."

Heritage Foundation President's Book Delayed

DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT by Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts, with a foreword by JD Vance--the book associated with the conservative organization's Project 2025 policy agenda--has been moved to a publication date after the election. The book was slated to come out from Broadside on September 24; Edelweiss and major bookselling websites now list the pub date as November 12.

Roberts told Real Clear Politics in a statement that he decided to move the book. ""There’s a time for writing, reading, and book tours – and a time to put down the books and go fight like hell to take back our country,"" he said ""That’s why I’ve chosen to move my book’s publication and promotion to after the election.""

Last week, The New Republic published Vance's foreword in full, and reported that they obtained an early copy of the book.

Broadside has not responded to a request for comment."

He was very persuasive because Americans were especially scared of (maybe even paranoid about) the Russian Communists after WWII.  The Russians claimed they were taking over the world (and having just dodged the bullet of the Nazis)  no  one was feeling ready to go to war again anytime soon.  McCarthy's idea that there were people within our government ready to help the Communists was really frightening.  Overtime, his lies caught up with him.  More and more people started to see the injustice his angry, demagoguery had perpetrated.  However, a lot of people suffered greatly in the meantime."

In my anecdotal experience, and having traveled to Poland and Israel on human rights study trips, I've found this to be true. Stripping rights away happens in these authoritarian governments, along with silencing and harming opponents. Populism combined with authoritarianism is dangerous."

She has high name ID, people know almost nothing about her, and the persuadable voters know less than everyone else."" I think this is such great advice - we can make a great impact just by sharing what we know about her and what we like about her work so far.

They spend 8M at USPS just at the end of June in one single transaction, there were more on there too. Not to mention the RNC is required to pay trumps legal fees because of the contract Laura trump put in place when she took over. They spent SOOOO much money on advertising against Biden, only for him to drop out, and thats why trump has been screaming about refunds"

You can be propalestine and not be antisemectic or support terrorism. Thats just a political way to keep the group seperated from the ability to have compassion for them which is why you hear that as the only talking point. Its just like the war on terror.

I'm going to be very interested to see how/if this lawsuit is covered by the media. It should get lots of coverage *if* it's a legitimate threat...if not...then maybe it's just 'theater' for the red states to demonstrate their loyalty to DJT and not worth our time and anxiety. I'd recommend the podcast 'Strict Scrutiny.' It's a couple of Constitutional Law professors discussing current events. If this lawsuit is a threat then I'd imagine that they would address it on an upcoming episode.

Any ""intellectual"" or economist critique of these policies is vastly out of touch with the average American, because it amounts to handwringing over theoretical economic effects instead of the much more basic reality: lower prices make the cost of living more affordable for working people.

It's the same reason that investing in the American people with big legislation like ARP, IRA, etc. is smart despite what deficit hawks attempt to fearmonger over: it materially improves people's lives in the immediate term. That is what politics is about. That is what government is about."

He somehow still has this reputation as “the funny candidate” even though he hasn’t been funny in years.

Remember 2016 when people irl would make references like “build the wall” and “lock her up” in person? 

He hasn’t done anything that’s funny like that since 2020 at best. Personally, I’m just so bored of everywhere always covering this guy.

I hope America as a whole can show how bored we are of him this November. 🤞"

Here’s an emotional summary: It is straightforward. The yearly unauthorized entries at the border are about 1/2 a million. Meanwhile, about a million people overstay their authorized entry into the US. Another 1/2 a million people become legal residents in the US because of family ties. The number of “encounters” last year was 2 and a half million, but encounters are not unauthorized entries into the country! No one talks about Spanish tourists being a problem, one of the worst groups overstaying their visas, or the many US citizens' family members who become legal residents too easily. But there is an outcry about the inflated number of poor brown people risking their lives to cross the desert to sustain the American economy. Why? Because disinformation about a border invasion creates fear and uncertainty and ultimately votes for anyone promising to fix the non-existing problem.

Even their orange king didn't get everything he promised, because of checks and balances.

With the election just 76 days away, the electoral map looks better and better for Vice President Kamala Harris. Here are the changes:
- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District: Lean Blue to Likely Blue. This poll https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/08/20/harris-leads-trump-in-new-nebraska-2nd-district-poll/ shows a +8 advantage for Harris, showing a growing lead in the Omaha Area.
- Michigan: Tilt Blue to Lean Blue. The news of Uncommitted leaders in the Wayne County Area endorsing Harris after her rally in Detroit can help improve her margins in the state, making it a little safer.
- Florida: Lean Red to Tilt Red. Is a blue Florida possible this year? Maybe, but not quite yet. One video that shows me growing confidence in a close Florida is a clip of massive turnout to get out the vote in The Villages, a predominantly older community the usually goes for Trump. Not a tossup yet, but we'll see where the numbers go.
- Maine's 2nd Congressional District: Likely Red to Lean Red. This poll https://scholars.unh.edu/survey_center_polls/807/ shows Trump with only a +2 lead in that part of the state, showing perhaps a shift in that area.

Again, these are just numbers and colors on a screen. None of this matters unless we go out and vote on November 5th and work to get others out too. More updates will come closer to Election Day."

It’s okay. You haven’t gone over to the dark side. 

The dark side came into your political space in the form of Donald Trump and his Extremists and pushed you instead to honor your core beliefs held deep in your heart of hearts. 

Belief in our democracy, belief in our country, belief in the power of the people to be better, to do better.

Democrats will welcome you into their world and will still allow you to think and behave differently from them, because they will respect your choice to choose your country.

I am a KamalaCrat. I have voted both Democrat and Republican in my life and have widely held beliefs from both sides. People like us used to be called Centrists.

But poll the question “do you support a ceasefire that allows Hamas to remain in charge and no return of hostages” and you’ll get 70% of people voting No.
I’d also like to see cross tabs, likely voter rating, and ranking of the issue (how many consider it top 3? Top 10?)

The reason we try to keep the conversation limited to volunteer opportunities and logistics is partially to make sure we can do things about the sensitive topics that bring us into the world of politics, while also making sure those working towards these efforts have the space to ask questions and learn while focused on those specific tasks. Please know that if we shut down a conversation here, that's not intended to say that these opinions or concerns don't matter! 

As Emily said earlier, there's also some great places to give feedback if you wish. https://democrats.org/contact-us/ is one place where the campaign is receiving feedback, and don't forget that those trained to use the REACH App can also share concerns documented from political engagement that way.

It's very illegal under campaign finance law for this server to link to non-dnc fundraisers of any kind (given its status as being officially ran by the DNC). The Mod Team typically opts for ""better safe than sorry"" while deciding edge cases. It's very possible that your specific link would've been considered fine (I wouldn't know, I wasn't the one to remove it), but given the scale of our operation here, best not to take that risk for the many links we see passing through here.

Simply vetoing a national ban leaves state bans in place. That's just not good enough because the rights of women in Florida, Arkansas, and Arizona, for example, should matter just as much as the rights of women in states which at the moment still affirm these rights."

As someone who comes from a culture where women are often marginalized and underestimated, this election holds a special significance for me. It represents a chance for us to show the world that females are capable and deserving of leadership roles. This election is not just about choosing our next leaders; it is about paving the way for global women empowerment. It is about proving that when we come together and fight for what we believe in, we can achieve anything. This election is a symbol of hope and progress, a chance for us to finally break free from the chains of sexism and discrimination.

For me, this election is deeply personal. It is about more than just politics; it is about healing and restoration. It is about finally seeing the prayers of generations of women come true. It is about believing in ourselves and our abilities, and showing the world what we are truly capable of. This election is a turning point, a chance for us to make history and create a better future for all women, not just in our country, but around the world. It is a chance for us to stand up and say, ""We can, and we will."" This election is about empowerment, equality, and the belief that together, we can achieve great things."

I wasn't able to quickly find a source with data to validate that claim, but assuming it's true then yeah for sure, some kind of purple wave outreach concept would be cool. I know purple = royalty but a quick look at search results shows that it also represents wisdom. And the idea of wisdom seems to resonate with more conservative people—""common sense"" is a term I've seen them use/relate to, along with ""restraint."" Voting for calm, steady, stable people would seem to be the conservative choice--and only Harris/Walz offers that."

Especially when some of the people we want to and can win over are religious.

One of my best friends in college was a senior who had been a a catholic priest but left the church in the 1970s because he was gay and wanted to be out. 

This was in Nebraska mind you. 

But he never left religion and opened the Omaha chapter of Metropolitan Community Church of Christ. Which was and remains an LGBTQ+ friendly church. He also took the pulpit for the Omaha chapter of Unity Church and was later in the 2000s recognized as ‘the grandfather of gay liberation in Nebraska’.

He never stopped being religious, though later in life his religion was kind of a mix of Christianity and Buddhism.

We could point to a number of other Christian denominations that are definitely progressive and accepting. We can also point to non-Christian examples."

You said something similar later in this convo, about how he actually has to compete because his views aren't appealing, but maybe his party should've kept their promises to us about Roe instead of the ""Christian nationalists"" and he wouldn't be losing."

On November 5, American citizens will go to the polls to choose their next president, in a race that has been tense and dramatic.

In late July, current US President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election after weeks of pressure following a disastrous debate performance and growing questions about his health.

Biden endorsed his vice president, setting the stage for a showdown between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.

The Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago last week, confirmed Harris' nomination and that of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her choice for vice president.

The two are now locked in a bitter confrontation with Trump and his vice presidential pick, JD Vance.

Who is ahead and who is predicted to win?

According to the latest national polls and historical data on Biden and Trump collected by Euronews, trends indicate a recent increase in support for Harris, with just over two months left for both candidates to campaign and increase voter support, especially in key US states."""

Payments can be spread out over subsequent years. Within that $100 million club, you'd only pay taxes on unrealized capital gains if at least 80% of your wealth is in tradeable assets (i.e., not shares of private startups or real estate). One caveat for this illiquid group is that there would be a deferred tax of up to 10% on unrealized capital gains upon exit.

4) the interview was ""staged"" and ""fake""

6) They had notes.

These are all pretty pathetic (I don't think any even require a response unless they somehow gain traction), which to me indicates they both did a great job.

In the end, nothing was said that hasn’t already been communicated directly to voters. With Walz, inordinate time was spent re-litigating questions from his 2006 Congressional campaign that the national public has already moved on from as told by how little it still gets talked about on social media. And Bash spent a lot of time trying to play ‘gotcha’ while asking worthless and, frankly, idiotic questions with almost 0 political context, e.g. ‘you were VP for 3+ years! Why didn’t *you* put on a Captain Marvel suit and solve *the problems*!’ Hmmm geee… let’s think about that one… But there is basically 0 acknowledgment of scorched earth obstructionism from Republicans in Congress and the Supreme Court — and somehow the Biden/Harris admin still signing a historic amount of legislation.

Kamala did great. Outstanding. ‘The media’ gets an F, imho, for acting entitled to the role of ‘arbiters of public discourse’ without actually rising to the occasion.

I was disappointed because they both dodged several questions the same way Trump does. The interviewer had to ask the same question several times because it wasn’t answered the first time. And Harris talked about helping the middle class just as Trump does. We need specific differentiation between her idea of helping the middle class & his. Imagine undecided independents trying to figure out whether Harris or Trump is more sincere when they communicate in the same way (not answering direct questions) & say they are for the same thing (improving the economy & helping the middle class).

1) Reauthorizing child tax credit (which she said in the interview)
2) building 3million houses so they're more affordable
3) reducing the max price of insulin for everyone (instead of just seniors, which they've already done).

Trump has: eliminate taxes on tips, which under his implementation would also help millionaires and billionaires evade taxes even more easily.

Harris/Walz proposed to do this same thing but remove the loophole.

Trump also has no plan to pay for any of his proposals.

Kamala does: tax the rich (who have more than $100million in assets) on unrealized capital gains."

Harris is campaigning on bringing people together and governing all Americans under the laws predicated by the constitution. The Trump Era is over - that is - the era of ""I can't have a conversation with those people."" The Era of Empathy and Action is here. That is: ""I hear your pain. What are we going to thrive in the face of all these problems together now?"" For one I want to defend the constitution in this country as the protection of freedoms it has been and, if Harris is elected can continue to be, for so so many human beings.  I will look for at least one Palestinian American to talk too about their concerns in this election and encourage them to consider what Ms. Harris is actually saying versus what the press says she is saying.

And I think it is important to state - as others have here - that there was also a lot of substance  and details in this interview.  Maybe a more effective response to Leslie's comment would have been for me to say something like: in response to your concerns about how Harris responded to questions about supporting the middle class, I know for me, an important one was the 25K tax credit on first-time home ownership. When I bought my first home we had something similar, a federal tax credit on home loan interest. When Trump ended that federal tax credit that hit my bottom line on owning a home!  She included other details as well. Extending a tax credit to the first year of a child's life.  And dealing with capping drug prices. And she included to context of our nation recovered economically faster that other countries post pandemic. As a family in the middle class I know that is true. We benefitted from stimulus checks and weathered that crisis but as a result had to change the kind of cheese we bought. Inflation is coming down now."

“A recent Wall Street Journal poll found that 84% of voters say they have enough information about Ms. Harris’ policy positions and career to form a firm opinion.”

Certainly puts one of the Republican/MSM talking points of the the past week into a different light, e.g. ‘We don’t know her policies! What are her policies! Policies! Policies! Give us policies!’ 

Cause… ya know… the mainstream political press is always so substantive and likes detailed and thoughtful convos about public policy. Yup. Yup. And also always has such a good pulse on the thoughts of regular people. Riiiight."

Does anyone know why the campaign picked CNN and why it wasn't a live interview? CNN's reputation and reporting is terrible. CBS, ABC, PBS, or NPR or even one of the content creators they invited to the DNC would have been better. It's hard to defend against ""well Trump goes on NBC and places he's not welcome"" when our candidate is on CNN"

How are we addressing the lack of response/complete ignoring of the questions about hostages when Walz was asked? I have Jewish friends that are very upset about that, and I can understand it. With Trump bragging that he is supporting Israel, it really just isn't a good look for the response from Walz to be walking away, imo. I know we are full of joy to have great candidates, and I hope To shed light on these issues that may be very significant to some voters, especially Jewish voters."

Exciting news this week:
1-New voter numbers! Per TargetSmart on CBS News, compared to July 2020, young Black women have seen a 176% increase in new voter registration and young Latinas just behind at 150%!

2- Per the Washington Post, your social media content and shares *do* matter! The 227 creators at the DNC made 7k posts... that generated almost 400 million impressions!

Tester is in a close race to keep his Senate seat in Montana. We absolutely want to keep that. Somehow the Maryland Senate race has Alsobrooks at a tie against her GOP opponent. 

If we can keep Montana and Maryland, we still have elections in Minnesota and Wisconsin that have Dems ahead but within the margin of error. 

In term of playing offense: The last poll has us within 3% of Rick Scott in Florida. I know folks are a bit excited for Texas, but Allred is still more than 5% away from Cruz. 

Osborn is a pro-labor independent running in Nebraska. They are within 1% of Republican Deb Fischer. That race has a ton of undecideds atm. ‘Reasonable’ people expect they will mostly break for Fischer in the end. I’m not so sure.

Anyway… worth considering helping make sure we have a Dem Senate majority to pass the legislation needed to realize Kamala’s opportunity economy 💪"

The LMN party had been polling between 10-15%. Kerry Eddy ended her campaign because she ran in the LMN party’s primary pretty much so she could then end her campaign and support Osborn.

 — 
Judge Tanya Chutkan has set a schedule in the federal election subversion case against former President Donald Trump that **will allow prosecutors to release never-before-seen evidence, such as grand jury transcripts, ahead of the presidential election**.

The deadline for the filing from prosecutors is September 26, according to the latest order from the judge, which largely sides with special counsel Jack Smith’s proposed schedule discussed at Thursday’s hearing. Trump’s defense team had sought to delay the public release of evidence in the case until after the November election.

This is the one of several filings the judge expects before voters head to the polls. She has not scheduled additional hearings or a trial date."

Wealth and Influence: Trump’s donors tend to be more traditional, wealthy Republicans with personal or transactional ties to him, while Harris's donors are often from tech and arts sectors, focusing on collective and long-term political strategies.

Engagement and Strategy: Trump’s major contributors have shown a willingness to take risks on unconventional candidates or strategies, whereas Harris’s donors seem to be consolidating around established Democratic frameworks and the broader party infrastructure.

Demographic Trends: Trump's donor base includes a mix of old-money and newer, tech-driven wealth, while Harris's support is more concentrated among progressive and establishment figures, particularly following Biden's exit from the race.

Summary
Both campaigns harness significant financial resources from their respective donor bases, but the characteristics, motivations, and backgrounds of these donors reveal broader trends in American political fundraising and the evolving nature of party allegiance."

as much as i wish ""let's motivate them!"" would work, with so many roadblocks in the way, it's hard to overcome that too. we know that we could flip the state, just that the people in power are willing to outright ignore our votes anyway. or, at worst, find a way to consider them illegitimate. 

instead, what i think would help, is _federal_ pro-voting measures that restricts them from putting so many roadblocks."

I’ll also add, the polls are really weird overall this time around. In 2016 and 2020, Trump performed better than the polls predicted, so the models for 2024 have all adjusted accordingly. However, democrats have been over-performing as well—most notably sincd 2022 when polling said there would be a red wave, but in the end dems lost the House by only a few seats, and also any time there are abortion amendments.

Meanwhile, things are happening in terms of new voter registrations and enthusiasm that the polling is probably not capturing because it isn’t sure how to model 2024. 

And we have a lot of other strange things happening with the polling this cycle where some democratic Senatorial candidates are polling significantly higher or lower than Harris in a way that is a bit difficult to believe.

So we’ll see lotta polls. Find whatever in them that motivates you. Then let them go. My 2 centz"

After appealing a decision on serious sexual misconduct allegations, Trump and his lawyers spent 50 minutes not only criticizing the ruling but also dredging up past incidents, which could further damage his image.

Why choose this approach instead of discussing his presidential plans? Here are six key takeaways from their comments that viewers might have missed:

  1. E. Jean Carroll's Testimony: Dismissing her story as 'utterly implausible' overlooks the jury's careful deliberation. They weighed the evidence and made their decision.

  2. Credibility of Witnesses: Just because the defense finds some witnesses unreliable doesn't mean their testimonies were improperly admitted. The court followed legal procedures, and the defense had ample opportunity to challenge the evidence.

  3. Political Motivation Claims: Framing this lawsuit as a political attack distracts from the serious nature of the allegations. The focus should remain on the facts, not political narratives.

  4. Judicial Bias: If Trump's team believes there was bias in the courtroom, they should address it through appropriate legal channels. The integrity of our justice system is crucial.

  5. Emotional Appeals: Using emotions to sway opinions doesn’t change the legal arguments. We must prioritize facts and evidence.

  6. Legal Process Integrity: Claims that the legal system is 'weaponized' are unfounded. All parties, including judges, are committed to upholding the law.

In summary, instead of addressing the merits of the case, the Trump team seems intent on undermining the rule of law once again. It’s a risky strategy, especially since they may still be campaigning against Biden and his supporters, who are less easily swayed."

The way Facebook moderates posts is not always accurate. Especially if it is being reported by those you are arguing with - they have an agenda to discredit - and mass reporting sometimes has this effect. 

The Reach app content has been thoroughly vetted for accuracy and you can also check out the new Harris issues page for more information. If you'd like help looking up a particular talking point I'm happy to help.

His model doesn't account for the exceptional circumstance of this election cycle (how can you predict something that is so different from prior years?), but his narrative has touched on it.

My read on the situation is that Harris experienced a huge bounce immediately when Biden dropped out; that bounce is just now petering off. Which is why she has been careful the entire time to repeat that we're the underdogs."

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but let’s be mindful of how we talk about Kamala. Our community is here to support the campaign by focusing on her leadership and the issues she stands for. Comments about her appearance, especially ones that bring gender into the mix, can take away from that focus. Let’s keep the conversation respectful and centered on the work we’re all doing together to support the campaign. 🙏💙"

With the debate starting soon, let’s all remember our shared goals: positivity, volunteerism, and getting Kamala elected!

As we’ve seen in past debates, some discussions—whether from media or personal circles—can veer into analyzing Kamala’s performance through a gendered lens. We ask that everyone remain sensitive to how these conversations can impact those who have experienced gender discrimination. Let’s keep our focus on policy discussions and show thoughtfulness in our commentary.

### Thanks for your support, and let’s continue working together to elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz! Enjoy the debate!"

Kamala is a hero. She faced a huge challenge. So much pressure. So many eyes on her, so many doubts from naysayers and worse. A media that undermines her constantly.  So many lies told about her, constantly. And the hopes of so many people around the world riding on her shoulders. And she did it. She did it for us. She used her talent, brains, sincerity, professionalism, and competence to get an enormous job done. THIS is the US I knew: Great people achieving great things, a place of winners and dreamers who seek to inspire instead of tear down and diminish. I am so happy for her.  And Joe Biden must be walking on air today. Right now she's on the front page of Financial Times, WashPost, NYT, and lots of international press, featured as the winner. Even WSJ concedes that she won, though they grumble about it."

China's startup sector is collapsing due to interference on ideological grounds—from 51,302 VC-funded startups in 2018, to just 1,202 last year 🤯 and fewer expected in 2024. Numerous quoted sources state that the climate for innovation in China is being hampered and funding is rapidly disappearing.

Notice that Trump et al never speak to the substance of the cases against him, attempting instead to gaslight the public about politically motivated charges and court procedures.

No doubt that he and all of those who wish to restore 1950s-era America, with all its implications, will do ANYTHING to win. I believe things will get worse -- a pre-extinction burst of horrendous behavior, or worse -- before they improve as we approach and win the Whitehouse. 

We must not be deterred."

A quick Google search suggests that various church groups in PA—especially PGH—make and sell them year-round.

Trump repeating this in a venue with 67 million viewers, and news and social media being able to spread and repeat this at the speed of light, is extremely dangerous! While this is a dark connection, I think it is a good idea to make folks that wonder about this (e.g. on your phone calls) aware of the parallels to how Nazi Germany othered and dehumanized Jews with this technique, ultimately leading to the holocaust. Haitians in Ohio are terrified, unfortunately for good reason. Sorry for getting so dark, but this is really serious."

I feel like this is how a lot of folks in MAGA operate. They want to bring you into hypotheticals and gamble on the possibility that they are right and ignore when they are wrong. They also know we can’t ignore being wrong and seek to find information that corrects wrong info.

If this were previous debates like those seen in 2008 and 2012, candidates would focus on policy and discuss their way of handling it, as well as the specific details. Trump did none of those things, he only started to fearmonger about scenarios such as ""the end of our country"" and ""World War III"", and used Haitians as a scapegoat to further his own image. That's not to say we can't change our opinions though if such claims are proven true, but such claims would not change our opinion about the abhorrent behavior of this candidate and former president. We are going to push for those articles that reinforce that incompetence, because those are the stories that matter, not a supposed coup involving the VP and the media."

In Springfield, Ohio, there has been a massive rise in communicable diseases, rent prices, car insurance rates, and crime. This is what happens when you drop 20,000 people into a small community. 

Kamala Harris's immigration policy aims to do this to every town in our country."

Follow the money: CNN is owned by Warner Bros. ""The leading shareholder in Warner Brothers Discovery is John Malone, a multibillionaire cable magnate. (Malone was a chief architect in the merger of Discovery and CNN.)

Malone describes himself as a “libertarian” although he travels in rightwing Republican circles. In 2005, he held 32% of the shares of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. He is on the board of directors of the Cato Institute. In 2017, he donated $250,000 to Trump’s inauguration.

Malone has said he wants CNN to be more like Fox News because, in his view, Fox News has “actual journalism”. Malone also wants the “news” portion of CNN to be “more centrist”."" https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/24/the-changes-at-cnn-look-politically-motivated-that-should-concern-us-all"

Florida (30 EVs) - 32% chance of a Harris victory
Iowa (6 EVs) - 15% chance of a Harris victory

The more that DJT seems like the loser, the more likely it will be that GOP folks refuse to co-sign his + JDV's increasinly unhinged lies and delusions. They will speak up if they no longer fear him. So we gotta keep moving, getting those poll numbers higher, collecting those strategic endorsements...we can do this! We're doing it for our candidates, but also on behalf of reality itself."

## We are increasing server security

❓ What do YOU need to do? Check to see if you have a phone number on your account. Phone numbers have to be mobile numbers. Landline and VOIP won't work. If you have not, set up and **verify your phone number**. For more information on how to check or verify your phone number on your Discord account, use this [support guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20you%20can%20also%20verify,beside%20the%20Phone%20Number%20section!) and scroll down to “Verify Your Phone Number”.

🛑 If your phone number is not verified by **Sept. 16th**, you will not be able to send messages or interact in the server until verified.

🔐 To achieve the best security within this Discord server, our admins will be enabling the strictest verification level available to us. This change will occur on **Monday, September 16**. By increasing our security, we will be able to verify all current server members, AND protect against bad actors infiltrating our community during the final stretch of this campaign!

Haitian and all immigrants in the U.S. work hard and contribute to their families and community. They pay taxes. We ask that anything you share or say about our beloved Haitian community is positive and protective of them, to help us change the narrative about this vibrant group of people and resilient, hardworking residents in the U.S. Thank you!"

The media has been quite bad on covering the issue of inflation, which Trump & Co. decided to make a major line of attack 1-by equating high inflation to bad economy (its not), 2- by not challenging the argument that if it happened under Biden then it is his fault 3- by never emphasizing that Trump made no case for why is it Biden's fault and what he would have done differently, and finally 4- by ignoring the offsetting increases in wages. I think my argument to debunk is the simplest and most effective way we can approach this. but I am having a hard time getting it out there.

As an attorney and policy analyst, I have been doing so since 2012. And now we found many unaware of the existential threat to our democracy  that is looming. That threat, is Donald Trump. He showed us four years ago who he is, and what he is capable - and now there is no palliative force such as Mike Pence anymore - just the opposite. And he has been immunized by the highest court in the land for his most egregious misdeeds.  Now it is up to us - to spread the word about the devastating effects Trump's Project 2025 will have on everyone - not just his voters.

This year, thanks to her stronger standing in state polls than in national ones, our forecast thinks Harris needs to win the national popular vote by only about 2.1 points in order to be favored to win. However, that still means the Electoral College will probably help Trump, meaning that it's essential for Harris to maintain her current lead in the northern battleground states especially. That's why our forecast gives Harris a 61-in-100 chance of winning instead of 72-in-100 (her current chances of winning the national popular vote).

 Climate Change as known government National Security Threat
·   ""By the late 1980s, official National Security Strategy documents, prepared by the White House to guide the national defense priorities and military strategy, acknowledged the threat to U.S. national security from a broad range of demographic and environmental factors.” -Gleick, 2019
·   Climate change and energy are two key issues that will play a significant role in shaping the future security environment,"" noting that ""climate change, energy security, and economic stability are inextricably linked."" -DoD, 2017
·  “We recognize that climate change is a threat to U.S. national security and the well-being of the American people,” Farnan said during a press event Wednesday.” – US Army
· “Climate change has serious implications for national security .. Climate change is dramatically increasing the demand for military operations and, at the same time, impacting our readiness and our ability to meet those demands while imposing unsustainable costs on the department,""- DOD, 2022

Climate Change has been recognized as a National Security Threat in several U.S. Military Field Manuals and strategic documents:

· Department of Defense (DoD) Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap (2014)
· National Security Strategy (NSS)
· National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
· Army Field Manual (FM) 3-0, Operations
· Marine Corps Operating Concept (2016)

I find it troubling that we can be considering electing a President who is a climate denier and our military and Special forces are ok with that.. I would really like to see the military stand up for this election, especially those who know it is considered a national security threat in the field manuals"

I want to take a minute and say that I hear you. We hear you. Many of us share the same concerns you have. And we know that bad news gets clicks, it gets attention. Bad news is infectious.

But we can choose where we focus our energy. Personally, I'm ignoring polls. I'm just foot on the gas until Nov. 6th, because even if someone tells me Harris +32 across the country, I want +38. I'm staying alert to the news, and I'm choosing to turn my energy towards action instead of what-ifs. When I wake up on Nov. 6th I want to know that I did EVERYTHING I could to win this.

We are in the middle of this campaign, and it can feel like a lot. We can do this though! We can choose to recognize the realities of what is at stake here AND we can choose joy. We can choose to turn our energy towards activating. When we do that we come out with a win win win. 

So, tell me, what are you doing to turn that energy into action? Or, what's one positive piece of news, or joy, around the campaign that you can share with others? Because joy is just as infectious!"

Here is a concise synopsis of the key points from the interview:

1) New polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in three key ""blue wall"" states - up 6 points in Pennsylvania, 5 points in Michigan, and 1 point in Wisconsin. This may be part of a broader national trend favoring Harris.

2) The latest Iowa poll shows Trump's lead over Biden has narrowed significantly, down to just 4 points after leading by 18 points in June.

3) Strategist Simon Rosenburg believes the debate helped Harris and hurt Trump, with the aftermath of Trump's efforts to change the subject being ""a huge failure"" for him. 
Rosenburg says the Democratic ticket is in a strong position with high favorability, and they have a better capacity to gain ground in the coming months.

4) While the Teamsters union did not endorse the Democratic ticket nationally, Rosenburg notes there were many local Teamster endorsements in key battleground states, and the campaign has worked hard to maintain strong union support, which he believes will be the most enthusiastic for a Democratic ticket in decades."

Specifics:
1) Health Care Costs: Harris supports extending enhanced Biden-era tax credits that have reduced health care premiums for millions. The Inflation Reduction Act caps insulin prices at $35 per month and limits out-of-pocket drug costs to $2,000 annually for seniors.

2) Medical Debt: Approximately 33% of Americans are affected by medical debt. Harris's initiatives aim to relieve $7 billion in medical debt for 3 million people by 2026 and propose excluding all medical debt from credit reports.

3) Reproductive Rights: Harris's policy plan affirms her commitment to safeguarding abortion rights, especially after the Dobbs ruling. She has launched a 50-stop reproductive freedom bus tour to promote her agenda.

4) Gun Violence: The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act includes measures like strengthened background checks and funding for school security, representing a significant legislative effort in response to gun violence, with tens of millions allocated for safety grants.

5) COVID-19: Harris has advocated for a $250 million contribution to an international pandemic preparedness fund and supports ongoing research for long COVID, addressing a condition affecting millions who experience lingering symptoms.

6) Paid Leave: Harris proposed six months of paid family and medical leave, significantly more than the 12 weeks included in the American Families Plan, and supports expanding the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600 per child, as well as $6,000 in tax relief for lower-income families during the first year of a newborn’s life.

The headline is as awful.  I’m going through video of the hearing now to see if this is indeed what the former border patrol agent said.  I’m well aware that the Biden Admin was ready to sign the border bill Congress was working on a year ago and that Trump scuttled.  Letting this acquaintance know that is not going to suffice.  Has the campaign put out any kind of response to these allegations by this former border patrol agent?  This is someone who would vote for Harris but this article has her very concerned and I’m worried she might change her mind and heaven forbid vote for Trump.   If she is feeling this way we could lose other voters particularly in border states on this issue,  I’m headed to AZ a border state next week to knock doors.  I need some good talking points on this allegation that border patrol was told to not report border crosses with ties to terrorism.  Can someone point me to a rapid response on this, admin statement in response, Harris campaign statement???"

Restore and Protect Reproductive Freedoms
Vice President Harris and Governor Walz trust women to make decisions about their own bodies, and not have the government tell them what to do.

Donald Trump handpicked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom – and now he brags about it. In his words, “I did it, and I’m proud to have done it.” He even called for punishment for women who have an abortion. 

Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, Vice President Harris has driven the Administration’s strategy to defend reproductive freedom and safeguard the privacy of patients and providers. As Governor, Tim Walz led Minnesota to become the first state to pass a law protecting a woman’s right to choose following the overturning of Roe. Vice President Harris has traveled America and heard the stories of women hurt by Trump abortion bans. Stories of couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Stories of women miscarrying in parking lots, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever have children again — all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. As President, she will never allow a national abortion ban to become law. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, she will sign it."

All very very helpful but this woman is aware Trump scuttled border bill.  What I need to be able to address is the allegation by this border chief that the administration was directing him to cover up serious problems at the border.  As I doing my own research, this hearing seems to be part of a series of hearings called by the Republicans to attack the admin and the Harris Campaign.  https://www.axios.com/2024/09/05/harris-walz-house-republican-investigations.

Paxton wouldn't be making so many aggressive attempts to preserve Republican control if they knew they had it in the bag. they're desperate, which means they can see things aren't going their way anymore. 

safe to say it's way, way too soon to make any bets. but it's not so unlikely that it _can't_ happen, just that it's a hard struggle due to how many walls they're throwing down to stop the blue wave, so it might take a while. 

circling back on topic though, i would _love_ to see Texas or Florida flip, because if anything that sends a LOUD message that there's a lot more joyful warriors than they could have ever hoped to prevent from voting"

I'm from Indiana!
I think it's very important  to turn my state BLUE again! We are currently  purple!! But Obama  was able to flip a red state such as Indiana BLUE!! He won that election  by a LANDSLIDE!! My point is small cities and towns like the ones that name up Indiana are the pulse that signifys to swing voters that if we Midwest voters are confident  in a candidate,  it MUST  be OK!!!!
Obama  visited my city TWICE! He held a rally  in our stadium!! He visited our most conservative  college campus to talk directly  with contractors  working on a building project fir the campus! It made a difference!! Incidentally Trump in his winning year, also visited our city several  times before he won his primary  bid and his presidency!
My Point Is VP Harris  has got to add Evansville IN to her trail!! She's got to visit!! She's trailing  45 in our polls by a small percentage.  But she needs ti close that GAP.  It's the difference  between  eking out a win in the electoral college, and a precise LANDSLIDE VICTORY.!! Leave NO room fir accusations of stealing the VOTE!!
So if ANY of you have connections  or influence  to her campaign  managers and advisors. PLEASE  RESPECTFULLY PASS THIS ON!!

Ultimately, the article concludes that Trump is not a fascist, but rather a cynical and erratic politician who could potentially enable the rise of fascism if he is re-elected. The author argues that good government is the only guarantee against the worst form of politics returning, and that a victory for Trump could be a cause of 21st-century fascism, not because he is a fascist, but because he doesn't know how to govern.

but polls can change, and as we saw in the debate, a _lot_ can change all at once. polls are, at most, a snapshot -- often 3-5 days later if not more -- of the _recent past_ opinions of a small sample of people. they're not at all reliable for predictions, except as a ""if it happened NOW, these are the likely breakdowns"" and definitely _not_ ""this is how it will go in the near future"". if anything, polls affect voters, not voters affecting polls. 

at most, i'd give polls a ""this is fun for thought"" and little else in terms of weight. encourage people _not_ to rely on polls to feed their voting decisions, and to rely on activism instead - such as phonebanking."

Definitely voter registration on campuses is a thing. There are a few options available that you could contact: 1) Most campuses have a local Dem club affiliated with the school - see if they have ongoing efforts 2) OR try your city's Dem club or local Dem Party office to see 3) OR check out the <#1268356016240857088> channel here to see what options are listed. Where are you in California? (Asking as a fellow Californian)

The last governor in Massachusetts is a Republican and he won by a bigger margin than Warren did in 2018. I voted for both of them. I will do split voting again this cycle as well. You can't win as Republican in Massachusetts running on a MAGA platform. Plus love the fact that Harris was a prosecutor.

1) Lowering Costs for the Middle Class: She emphasizes cutting taxes for over 100 million middle-class families, lowering the costs of housing, child care, and prescription drugs. Harris also plans to offer $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers and tackle corporate price gouging.

2) Supporting Small Businesses: Harris aims to make it easier for small businesses to grow by increasing the tax deduction for startups from $5,000 to $50,000 and providing low-interest loans. Her goal is to help create 25 million new small business applications during her first term.

3) Investing in Future Industries: She stresses the importance of leading in industries like clean energy, AI, and biomanufacturing. Harris plans to invest in these sectors and retool American factories to strengthen communities, create union jobs, and drive innovation.

4) Fair Economic Partnership: Harris advocates for a balanced partnership between businesses and workers, with rules that hold companies accountable. She promotes apprenticeship programs and skills training to help workers thrive in the modern economy.

In summary, Harris focuses on reducing costs, boosting small businesses, investing in future industries, and ensuring fair treatment for workers."

1) Tax Cuts for the Wealthy: Harris argues that Trump’s policies primarily benefited billionaires and large corporations, giving them trillions in tax cuts while raising taxes on middle-class families by nearly $4,000 a year.

2) Failing the Middle Class: She claims Trump has no intention of growing the middle class, focusing instead on enriching himself and the wealthiest Americans. Harris positions her plan as one that will help everyday workers, unlike Trump’s agenda.

3) Job Losses and Manufacturing: Harris points out that almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost under Trump’s presidency, even before the pandemic. She criticizes his promises to bring back jobs, using examples like the carrier plant in Indianapolis, where jobs were offshored to Mexico during his term.

4) Small Business Neglect: She references an article from a leading expert on small businesses titled ""Does Donald Trump Hate Small Businesses?""—with the answer being ""yes""—because Trump slashed small business programs and raised borrowing costs, making it harder for them to succeed.

5) Weak on China: Harris says Trump was repeatedly ""played"" by China, failing to address trade imbalances and offshoring. In contrast, she promises to take strong action to protect American jobs and industries."

HOW BIDEN & HARRIS HAVE FOUGHT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

CALIFORNIA. As California AG, Kamala Harris went after drug gangs, human traffickers and cartels that smuggled guns, drugs, and human beings across the US-Mexico border.

CENTRAL AMERICA ROOT CUASES. In 2021, VP Harris led the effort to address root causes of illegal immigration to the US from Central America, negotiating $4B in direct assistance and over $5.2B in US private-public investment. With economic recovery 2022-23, encounters at the Southern border from all countries increased, but the share of encounters from Mexico & Central America decreased by 30% points.

BIPARTISAN BILL KILLED BY TRUMP. In Feb 2024, Trump urged Republicans to REJECT the bipartisan immigration bill that included permanent restrictions on asylum while significantly increasing border agents, asylum adjudicators and immigration judges. The bipartisan bill (supported by ~20 Rep Senators) was DEMANDED and NEGOTIATED by Republicans who tied the bill to a Ukraine aid package, but Trump killed the deal for his own political gain.

BIDEN-HARRIS ASYLUM RESTRICTIONS. Between Feb and Jun 2024, the Biden-Harris administration developed and executed a plan for DHS and DOJ to suspend the entry of most migrants crossing the US-Mexico border illegally, virtually shutting down asylum processing. The Biden-Harris plan differs from Trump’s plan by providing exemptions for humanitarian reasons such as victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.The result was ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS FELL TO A 4-YEAR LOW. More recently, Biden has secured additional funding for the most significant increase in border agents in ten years. 

COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. As President, Harris will bring back the bipartisan bill and sign it into law. And she will push for  comprehensive reform that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship."

Quite frankly, even from a statistical standpoint, most polls have such a tiny sample size(500 - 1000) as to render it non-representative. Then they ""weight"" them to correct for perceived past polling errors! Add to that the genuinely baffling hypothesis that a large number of people can be swayed on fundamentally held preferences -- something social science and psychology in particular shows is not only highly unlikely but also that efforts to actually change someone's mind are frequently counter-productive and lead to entrenchment -- and what you wind up with is little more than fodder for media pundits. We should focus our efforts on driving out our base and increasing voter participation."

Quick reminder to keep them Harris campaign-oriented, only share news from articles, interviews, and socials. Please leave room for people to respond and let us know what you'd like to chat about with the links you share here. 

The idea is to generate conversation, discuss topics, and support one another and the campaign. Non-official events can go in <#1268426751164551199> and state channels only (we must move NE events to this channel and remove any events with fundraising attached per campaign finance law).

FEMA is working quickly and effectively, but right now, the scale of the damage is such that nobody has been able to do a true needs assessment. Roads are out so there's no way in or out, no power, no cell service, etc. I guarantee the Biden administration is handling this in the same way it has handled other disasters, by following protocols and providing help as requested by governors. I absolutely guarantee the white house and leaders are in close contact. But NC is really not a place for political campaigns right now - as Anthony said, the logistics take away from rescue/recovery efforts. But what IS really clear is how awful the Republican playbook is on FEMA, the national hurricane center, and climate change. Have you been phone banking or participating in online engagement to get the word out about the importance of a Harris administration compared to the awfulness of Project 2025?"

And I know, based on the Biden administration's quick and effective response to other natural disasters and situations like the Keystone Bridge, that they are hard at work on making sure folks in that area get the support they need. It's the role of good government when government is working well: to help people when they need a hand.

But I think the mismatch of where some few-millions of voters are in recent impact and seeing connection to campaign/Harris which <@345245681918803969> is mentioning is worth recognizing as being more than zero.   As folks mentioned:  informing about broader contrasts for 2025-29 pres. term would be helpful for folks that have focused on it.   To that end I see no content in the reach app videos/one-pagers or in discord meme-vault.  Not for mass media IMO.  I’d worry some messages might land poorly so close to the disaster but some info in more digestible form could be useful (DoI,NOAA,paper-towel-tossing,…) to help draw contrast & inform might be nice to have at hand.

——
Also.   Water trucks with yardsigns taped on them would be fine too and I believe compliant with campaign rules but the various governmental institutions instead of campaign are necessarily the prime source for that across all areas.  But maybe some key gap existed and can be filled quickly… could be a nice bit of earned media…. I’d hope/think a local campaign would do it though.   Like with covid ppe you sure don’t need dozens of “extra” buyers trying to pump resources into an area.  But if congressional candidate X knows Bob’s water which FEMA&others are NOT deploying and can bring in a couple trucks on short notice… that could be great earned media."

Just a morning reset...this channel is to discuss news **in ways that connect and uplift one another to do our volunteer work here.** 

Our hearts go out to everyone affected by the historic impact of Helene. We support the recovery and restoration efforts, which are sure to be long and complex. We respect that FEMA and state officials will tell us what they need most so we can respond with our best.

We won't solve national or global issues, or **win this election**, by debating FEMA response or the media.

Please, take serious concerns to your Team Leads (if it affects your work here and your responses to volunteers). They are the ones who can inform us on official campaign messaging and direct any anxiety into productive action.

Also, it's a great idea to practice Self-Care by limiting our focus on news in these final weeks. Let's not activate the negative feedback loop that's so difficult to stop. Instead, let's activate what we can control...contact with voters!

i was there when Ike hit Galveston, and it was awful. we got lucky, our street was the oldest so our power lines were underground. we had power back the next morning. but the rest of the neighborhood, and most of our side of town, was completely without power. people were sharing generators. we loaned ours to a family friend. one of my dad's coworkers had a tree fall on their house, so we took them in until they could move into a temporary housing while their new house was built. 

it took a _long time_ to recover. eventually we did, slowly but surely. but there were folks besides us who needed help much more than we did. hurricanes are HUGE, and this one devastated multiple states, in some places huge chunks of them. i can relate to frustration when we want our loved ones to be safe. i'm betting they're doing everything they can, especially since above being Dems or Repubs, they're Americans, too. covering that much ground is going to be hard, and it's going to take time, and it has to be done in steps so everyone's coordinating together. we got this, they got this. ♥"

he wore a friendship bracelet, something typically associated with women and young girls, to the debate. where we could see it on live television (provided his sleeves let us). 
this is who i want in office. a man who knows that wearing a 'girly bracelet' isn't going to make a statement about how much of a man he is.

Thank you for taking the time to compile and share that document. I can see the effort you put into gathering the resources.

Also there is a 1-2-3-4 punch manipulation of those groups that JD and Frump are very good at because of their own childhood shame...the author refers to it as a repeated ritual: 1- Frump or JD says something transgressive (ie people eating cats) 2-Pundits shame Frump all over the airwaves 3-Donald becomes the victim (See I'm all ganged up on but thats ok I'll take it for all of you)4- Frump ROARS back at his shamers and that is extermely cathartic for those out there suffering from their own shame. All in all a way to turn Shame to Blame. Democrats relate to steps 1-2 and Republicans relate to steps 3-4. Solution?? Difficult, but intercept at step 1, dont shame but clarify the truth and deflect without judgement/shame to create a competing narrative where you become the listener....(oh that's not true but tell me what you mean about X"".

I would be pointing out at every opportunity that there is a very good litmus test for who is telling the truth to America. Jesus told us to treat the immigrant as yourself, not turn them away as the right wants to do. Also not to seek power over others for your own gain, because money and power are idols, and that's exactly what rampant capitalism is. That is what defines and exposes the right. They can't argue it because any true Christian will see it clearly."

It’s a tragic event for us all. He also lost “his voters” in the pandemic. When covid first hit it killed red and blue alike. It’s possible initially he thought covid would mostly kill Democrats as it was so bad in cities like New York and Seattle where I am.

One study finds “A simple counterfactual analysis suggests that Trump would likely have won re-election if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower. We also find some evidence that COVID-19 incidence had a positive effect on voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency.”

The interviewer was pushing the ""abortion all 9 months"" theory in Minnesota. It was the first time I understood where the right was getting the ""9-month"" abortion idea. Tim said that when a woman needs an abortion for health reasons, is between her and her doctor, and it was clear they didn't want to put restrictions on that relationship. I thought he was very effective in pushing the woman's health care issue as opposed to someone running out in month 8 because she decided to terminate her pregnancy.  The host may have thought it was a ""gotcha"", but it was an ""a ha"" moment for me and made perfect sense. So I suspect many in the Fox News audience got it too.  Tim was adamant about ""VP Harris and I want to bring back Roe v Wade"" which I thought was very effective because getting into the minutiae of the Minnesota law was just going to confuse people. The interviewer also said that the family of the woman in Georgia said her death wasn't because of the abortion restriction laws, but Tim was on message that her need to travel to a different state delayed her health care and probably led to her death and he pivoted to the mess in Texas with the increase in pregnancy issues due to their strict law."

In the US, people are much more likely to identify as conservative or moderate than liberal. In fact, according to Pew Research, even in California slightly more people identified as conservative than liberal. This is also reflected in the 2020 CNN exit poll, where Biden won self identified moderates by 30 points. In my opinion this likely contributes to why messaging is often harder for Democrats, in addition to having more nuanced positions. It’s also important to understand that self-identified independents are not necessarily self-identified moderates.

This is just wrong making money off of sales of the Bible.    He also included in the Bible the 

Declaration of Independence 
And
The Pledge of Alegents!   

King James Version
Leather Bond
Selling for over $60 Dollars.    
Than he will also sign.   How can people be OK with this???   I realize some just see this as a book.   But many people see it for much more such as to give guidance in the times of need.  I am not a Trump supporter but he has gone to far, in many ways.  But using the Bible for policity is really over the top.   I am sorry I forget the state that wants a Bible in every classroom in the schools.   Separation of church and State but who cares he is Donald Trump.   But if this governor gets what he wants it will be amazing but the only Bible he wants in the classrooms are Trump's.  I admit that is not specifically said but  the governor is saying it must be leather bond.   KJV and have the Declaration if Independence in it and the Pledge of Allegiance in it.   So Trumps Bible.   He stands to make millions of dollars for these Bibles.   For his campaign!   This is just wrong on so many levels.   I will update the state i just didn't write it down."

After being left for dead on 09/23 at $12.15, the stock has jumped to today's intraday high of $27.24 a gain of 116% before closing at $25.28, a 108% gain. This would be a good indication of Trump's chances for an election win. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, a good indication of Democrats chances, closed at 5719 09/23 and finished today at 5815, a gain of 96 points or 1.7% over the same 13 trading days. While this indicates that both parties are gaining voters, Trump's gains are much greater than Harris-Walz especially among undecided voters. Is it true? Who knows? We'll just have to wait and see.

Actual early voting data coming in from PA shows democrats are building up a sizeable lead in that state early on.  Looks to be on pace to build a sufficient firewall of votes before the more conservative-leaning election day votes.  Michigan and Wisconsin also look promising.   

In the meantime, let's keep getting folks to VOTE."

I dabbled in trading digital currencies (cryptocurrencies) for a while. It has a lot of similarities to the stock market. There are lots of scams out there where the person offering the investment opportunity creates hype to pump up the share price. Then the creator sells all of their own shares, tanking the price per share (more common with digital currencies than stocks due to less SEC regulation). I wouldn't put it past debt addled Donnie to do something like that. The S&P 500 can't move as fast as a single stock because of the huge market capitalization. In other words, it would take a nearly impossible amount of money changing hands to make the S&P 500 go up by 100% in a month. A 1.7% gain in less than two weeks shows a very positive sentiment in the market."

I dream that US  campaigns could be drastically shortened. My preference is that All campaigns should be no longer than Kamala has had; it would mean far less time for nasty campaigning, far less voter fatigue, less time for contradictory polls bouncing to & fro.  There could also be less emphasis on fund raising if media coverage opportunities were time limited.. I know you probably feel I should be making calls instead of making wishes for the future right now but wishes for the future are the reason I’m in this and even though 11/5 is certainly the immediate issue,  I occasionally need to step back and look at the big picture in order to deep breath, reenergize and then get back to the dialer. If we talk about this stuff now, maybe 2028 or 2032 or 2036 or beyond could be saner."

I’m on the autism spectrum, and I was very anxious about calling, but data show calling voters has the greatest success rate in getting people to vote. I did it today, and it was easier than I anticipated. You can call at your own pace, so when I needed to, I just took a breather between calls.

While Kamala needs to be more left on foreign policy, we first need the country to be more left. So we have to vote and organize locally.

The dangerous part of the rhetoric being online it can deflate people in “red states” from not voting because nothing gets done. Where their local Democrats need them to turn out BADLY.

We need those people to progress and vote in their states, so the United States can start shifting. If they don’t, the states won’t move.

So we just got to at least encourage people to vote locally, and remember, progress is a marathon, not a sprint. We move step by step."

Isn't this about getting Kamala elected?

Organizing and building community should be about helping this team address the criticisms pointed at Kamala's policies.  If we can't talk about how we solve for that with the people we are in contact with where would we go to do that?  We need to solve for converting more voters to Harris/Walz.  How do we do that without mentioning the policy?  You censored my comment but I think it was about how to address the economy and inflation messaging that is not currently working with people that are not already Harris/Walz voters.  Being ""positive"" by not allowing a mention of the challenge is a little like sticking ones head in the sand.

Where can volunteers go to talk about framing the Harris/Walz policies in a way that reaches the Harris/Walz non-voters?"

ALL respectcable (and somewhat respectable) economists say the across the board draconian tariff scheme will spike inflation and the cost of living, will blow a gigantic hole in the budget deficit and will cripple our economy. Just think about it: everyone wants to wear Nike sneakers, but nobody wants to make them for 70c per hour (whihc is what the sweatshop workers in Asia are making them for). Tariffs are important to safeguard our competitevness in very narrow targeted areas that will enure the US wins the future, like battery techology, AI, advanced microchips etc. So, for example, Biden imposing huge tariffs on import of chinese EVS is a smart move, because we have a lot of good paying jobs in the EV supply chain and the battery technology is strategically important. These are the only kinds of tariffs that are acceptable. Again, tariffs are generally used to encourage domestic manufacturing of strategic goods, not as a means of collecting revenue from the US citizens by instituting an effective sales tax."

This makes no sense at all. All things being equal, more trade makes everyone richer. The wage exploitation issue is real but wage levels in Western countries like the USA have risen even higher since the 1990s when the factories first moved abroad. 30 years on, the kind of tariff you would have to impose on low-tech goods like Nike sneakers to move the shoe factory back to the USA would be so huge that sneakers would become a luxury item.

 Also, when we say ""people have not really become richer"" we have to be more precise in what we mean.  Real (ie., inflation-adjusted) median US household income is about 30% higher now than in 1992 and the median household can certainly afford more ""stuff"" like cheap sneakers, cell phones, computers etc now than 30 years ago. The reason people feel poor and stressed out is because the price of things we cannot outsource, like land to build homes on and services like a college education, medical care, child care, elder care have  risen much faster than wages and more of everyones' salary is spent on these items. Across the board tariffs are not going to solve any of these issues as these problems are all internal to the country.  
With regards to unions, yes we should encourage more union power in the strategic manufacturing industries we would like to develop like EVs, batteries, nuclear etc and one can use targeted tariffs to achieve that. Separately the government  also can facilitatie an increase in union power in the services sector which is much bigger now than manufacturing. Amazon workers, truck drivers, rail operators, teachers, dock workers etc are all under this category and tariffs do nothing for them."

David Plouffe himself laid out the case: The campaign thinks Trump's ceiling is about 48% in the swing states that matter and the Harris campaign is aiming to get her to as close as 50% as possible. Turn out is basically the ball game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=47s

If you have to look at a poll aggregator look at split-ticket or 538 as they both adjust for house effects and penalize/ignore junk GOP polls."

Would have lost by more in the sun belt (and probably wouldn’t have won Nevada. Not sure about New Hampshire (and the rest of New England to a lesser extent) since it’s kind of libertarian (The “live free or die” state) but he’s also from the area. Probably would have also done worse in Virginia and Colorado (possibly even lose them). Overall probably lower popular vote but possibly more electoral votes.

Every bit of hard work you've and others have done will pay off if we finish strong. Thank you for being here."

GA has had record-breaking turnout for both days early voting has been open. It's not a guarantee by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a great sign for us. Additionally, a lot of the early turn out has been in urban areas like Atlanta that are traditional dem strongholds. Urban voters are one of our most important voting blocks."

And Harris has done a truly admirable job with that by getting out of her comfort zone, and I think every interview I've seen really had high upside and not much downside, i.e. she didn't turn anyone off who wasn't already turned off. I don't feel like Trump has been successful at that."

Not as an either/or candidate, but rather a both/and! We’ve been missing that from a politician who wants to listen to everybody and create pragmatic solutions. She believes we all have more in common than what divides us, and I agree.

She is energizing the base by several policy proposals, such as Medicare covering in-home healthcare, building new housing, legalized marijuana, reparations investigation and much more.

She is also appealing to right leaning Independents and disaffected Republicans, by going to Fox News. Listing the threat to Democracy, how her economic plan is better, and highlighting gun ownership."

We voted to get rid of partisan gerrymandering. Then, 2 years later the gop legislature put a sneakily worded ballot measure in that lead with looking like it was going to ban lobbyist contributions over like 5 bucks. 

problem was that was already on the books and the rest of the initiative undid the anti-gerrymandering from before and boom! We're right back to the same situation we were in before and we hadn't even had a chance to have an election with non-gerrymandered maps yet."

They also tried to push for a change to the amendment process that would've made it so you didn't just need a majority of voters but the initiative would need to win in a majority of Missouri's districts and so many are rural that would be incredibly hard to do.

“Hasen told NBC News on Sunday that Musk’s PAC is only offering the payments to registered voters, not the general public at large, which is what could make the scheme illegal.

“Essentially what you’re doing is you are creating a lottery. You’re creating a lottery where the only people eligible to participate in the lottery are people who register to vote, or are registered to vote, and that’s illegal,” Hasen said.

He noted that the general intent behind election laws prohibiting bribery is to prevent people from buying votes, but “you don’t have to say you have to vote for a particular candidate in order to be breaking this law. ... It can be to either incentivize people to register or vote, or it can be to reward them,” Hasen told NBC News on Sunday.”"

We're now at a point where we have to close strong, which means doing the work regardless of what the polls and early votes say. (Although I too am encouraged by early voting numbers!) The single most important thing people can do right now according to the campaign is phone banking - it can increase turnout by 3.8%, and as you can see, that's within the margin for most of these polls. Would you all be able to head over to <#1242256751445934262> and make some calls, ideally tonight but any point in the next week would be super helpful? This is the number one priority for the campaign and really helps us get out the vote, which is how we're going to win this thing!"

I see that Harris was leading in the polls for much of the election. Now she is down in a TIPP poll, which accurately predicted elections 79% of the time, so not a junk poll. I understand polls are not votes, voters are votes, but Harris losing right now feels contrary to what I'm seeing: great energy on her side, huge crowds, on-target messaging, a truly massive volunteer campaign, versus a lackluster campaign on the other side. Several weeks ago, the narrative was he was in trouble, now it has switched. I suspect this might be some kind of propaganda misinformation/ratf**king campaign. What's going on? (I'm doing my part, written over 500 hand written addressed letters to swing state voters, signed up for door knocking in WI)."

disrespect is now everywhere: legal immigrants, childless cat ladies, minorities, even house pets--dog-eating immigrants. This is not the America they sacrificed for nor one I recognize.

Last year, with Canadian wildfire smoke everywhere, I wondered if this was the future of summer: burning eyes and lungs, air purifiers. If we elect leaders who ignore these problems, I think so.

By the end of our conversation I think I convinced him to choose Kamala over Trump. I presented to him evidence that America is on the brink of losing our freedom because of Donald Trump and Kamala can save us. So I asked him to go into the voting booth and choose Kamala in the best interest of America and the world.

This is why doing all the things like phonebanking, canvassing, and combating misinformation and disinformation is so important. We understand the assignment as the pro-democracy ticket. Between today and Sunday I hosting a phonebank, a friendbank, making content, and was just asked to do GOTV presentation to Win With Black Women for disabled voters. We need to get everyone turned out to vote. At the end of the day I am gender non-conforming gay woman of the Global Majority with a disability so I can't just sit on the sidelines. I said this also as a moderate conservative who attended the Republicans for Harris campaign event in Bucks County, PA a week ago. However, I have been involved in the campaign since the first week since I understand the assignment (Never-Trumper) in ways that others who share similar political views took longer to get here. Lastly, people unfortunately care more about power than freedom."

However, mail-in ballots are a legitimate and widely used method for voting across the U.S. 

Discouraging its use could disadvantage his voter base, so encouraging it ensures his supporters take advantage of all available voting methods. Rather than fighting against an established system that millions use, it makes sense to embrace it to maximize voter participation from his base."

Why would we cede the initiative on this narrative that Trump is the one backing out of interviews, that he's tired etc.? Because I think it was getting traction.

The three I about Trump's campaign -
Immigration, Inflation and Israel
Quite the opposite, I think that the three I should be Harris's advantage, not Trump's.
Immigration - Trump's comment about immigrants angered so many people. Who in good conscience could agree to Trump's policy of immigration?
Inflation - Trump's proposed tariff policy would cause "" inflation bomb "". In addition, inflation had lowered to 2.4% in September, thanks to Biden.
Israel - Trump will unconditionally support Israel. How about Gaza humanitarian crisis? Trump will not care about Gaza."
