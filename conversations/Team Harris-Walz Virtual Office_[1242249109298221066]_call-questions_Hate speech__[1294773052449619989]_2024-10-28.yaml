  content: 'Overall I have had incredible interactions with Americans during this
    campaign, and it''s been an amazing experience for me to come back from my job
    as a translator abroad to make these calls. I think I have managed to have a real
    impact on people''s lives and to inspire some great campaign events. Maybe I have
    a slight accent, either because I''ve been abroad or because my dad was British.

    Today I was calling into Nevada to independent voters with the NV dems. I  don''t
    want to alarm anyone, but I just wondered what our procedure should be if any
    of the callers we speak to should cross over the line into hate speech or threats.
    I expect the laws are different in different states about this.'

    \ nobody deserves to be subjected to that kind of abuse. Please take a break if\
    \ you feel like it would help and reset. We really appreciate you being here and\
    \ making these calls with us! \n\nWe have the hostile response option for people\
    \ who are mean and I'm also going to see if we have further guidance to answer\
    \ your question about hate speech, so please hold tight while I work on getting\
    \ an answer for you."

  content: I was able to confirm with a staff member that if we mark Hostile, that
    person will not be called back again. Right now that's the guidance we are being
    given. Thank you again for making calls as part of our team. With your help, we
    will win!

  content: I've had a good hard think about this. It's really sacrosanct free speech
    - there is probably more risk in having a flag abuse button than in not having
    one.
