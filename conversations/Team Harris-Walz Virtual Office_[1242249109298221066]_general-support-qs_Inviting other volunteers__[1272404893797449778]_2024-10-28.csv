Is it ok for me to invite folks from there to this discord server? Or do they need to take one of the trainings first?

I also have the same question about inviting folks to the Reach site"

If they'd like to take the training they're more than welcome since it covers how to use the server - but you can send them the invite."

Just FYI, I personally found this site a bit overwhelming when I first went to it, as due to it's organization by date it was kind of hard to find out what sorts of opportunities were available--so it doesn't seem like a great general link for folks first getting started. I'm trying to find out what friends are interested in doing and then sending them specific links to events or trainings in those areas. Is there any way an overview menu could be put together for this site?"
