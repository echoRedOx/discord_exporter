Each team has moderators, and there are moderators for the general chat channels. If you want to join call-mod, text-mod, etc. reach out to that team, they will give you the details. If you want to apply for general chat moderator, I'll connect you with Staff. The role includes training, shadowing, and the expectation is at least 3x 2 hour shifts a week during peek hours."

I was a back end text mod in 2020 and was hoping to do it again
