Content: As far as I know, yes. I signed up and now when I go to the event page it indicates that it is at max capacity. So guessing it’s not showing up in Mobilize since you can no longer sign up. But I still haven’t heard a time or place announced.

Content: Hi! 👋  The Democratic National Convention is coming up and the best way to help share the Democrat's message of progress and positivity is for you to host a watch party for your friends and family. (You can even make it private!) Here's how you can do that through Mobilize: https://events.democrats.org/c/convention2024/event/create/?utm_source=dnc_organizing&utm_campaign=sms_stw_mb_ds_vol_vrec_20240809_vm_natl_b1_a_na

Content: Hello Arizona!! I was wondering if there are any initiatives happening in Arizona with college students- specifically with registering students to vote (most should be eligible to vote in Arizona by November I think) and/or targeting Arizona students attending college out of state with how to request absentee ballots? That’s where I’d really like to volunteer my time!

Content: Hello everyone, for the Harris-Walz phone banking, is there any way to know the dates/times they’ll focus on Arizona voters? I’d like to focus my efforts in AZ but so far have hopped on phone banks talking with voters in GA, NY, & NJ. If anyone knows where I can find that info, I’d be grateful for the help. Thanks!

Content: Hi <@1255517762541846530> I appreciate you want to focus your effort on your home state. But we really don't know ahead of time which phonebanks go to which states, and all efforts are important. We are so grateful for all you do.

Content: I'm a CA resident that is interested in moving to AZ for the final month of the campaign to help organize. I can pay my own way to get to wherever I will be most helpful to the campaign, but I was hoping there might be another volunteer or member of the campaign that has a spare room that I could stay at while I volunteer. Please let me know (in DMs) if anyone can help connect me with the right person!

Content: According to the polls, trump gained significantly after the debate in Arizona. I’m more sympathetic to polls in the other states, but I’m not buying it with the great state of AZ. Pollsters are not getting their opinions right; it’s going to be a margin of error race in AZ

Content: Hello. I just got on here, haven't read the onboarding stuff yet. Wondering if anyone can advise on door-to-door canvassing in Arizona. I'm from out of state, but willing to come knock doors if it would be useful.

Content: Hey Lucas, that's awesome! Thanks for offering to help!! 

Your best bet would be contacting the AZ Dems party directly about this! We mainly focus on the national efforts here on the Discord but maybe another user could also point you in the right direction. You can search http://events.democrats.org/ for "canvassing" and "Arizona" as well. We also do call/text a lot of Arizona voters along with other swing states if you'd like to help with that as well. Check out <#1268398608097476750> for the list of virtual events to sign-up for!

Content: Personally, I think either one is a really good choice. They both have the potential to have a huge impact on the electoral picture. I think reaching out to AZ Dems / GA Dems party offices would be your best bet to see where and how you can impact with canvassing. I can't link to their websites as they have fundraising links not associated with the campaign, but you should be able to find them easily and if not, I can DM you the links.

Content: On this day 4 years ago, a record 3.3 million Americans cast their ballot early.  And as expected, only 1.7 million early votes have been cast (a 45% decrease).  Please use the link below or call the Democratic Voter Assistance Hotline 9am-9pm (EST) (1-833-336-8683) to request an absentee ballot, or make a plan to vote early or on election day.  https://iwillvote.com/

Content: I was there as a volunteer passing out water to people in line. I walked 7 miles on Thursday going back and forth in that line!  I barely made it inside thanks to the fire marshal opening the doors back up after they counted the number of people inside. Over 12K RSVP'd. Initially 6K were admitted, but it wound up being closer to 7K.

Content: Remember: Since about 80% of the state votes by mail, Arizona is the only presidential swing state that processes and counts absentee ballots as soon as they get them.  That's why it is extremely important that you hand deliver your ballot and not put it in the mail.  The sooner you deliver your ballot, the faster we can get the results on election night.
