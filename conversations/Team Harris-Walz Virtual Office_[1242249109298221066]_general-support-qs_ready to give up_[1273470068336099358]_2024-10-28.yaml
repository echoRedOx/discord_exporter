  content: Jeff I also sent you a DM with a suggestion where you clear the storage
    for the app on your phone. The steps I gave are for Android but I'm sure that
    iOS has something similar.

  content: I had this happen with another app so I knew that aside from restarting,
    this trick works. The only thing is I only know how to do it on Android since
    I never used an iPhone.
