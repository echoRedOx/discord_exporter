Content: <@936622618293968958> did it refresh once you backed out and clicked again? We just switched to WI, so that might have caused the glitch?

Content: Nope. I'll just keep trying.  Maybe network is shaky in my area. Thanks Jen!

Content: <@936622618293968958> you may want to close out completely, toggle your internet connection off, wait a few minutes, toggle internet back on, then reconnect to the dialer. Which I know is basically a fancy way of saying...have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in again. But actually disconnecting from my internet network and reconnecting has helped in certain situations.

Content: Sorry, I know this is frustrating. 2 things to try - first if you're on a Safari browser, try Chrome. second, see if going inconito fixes it.

Content: Thanks, Larry! I'll give that a go, cause I was still getting the error. Hopefully it's just me and not a bunch of callers.
