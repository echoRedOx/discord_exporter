  content: I just want to add that (from my experience) so many of the trainings are
    set too early for west coast folks to attend them ( I work odd hours, so could),
    but most of them hit 3 or 4 pm during the workday here. If some later times could
    be offered, I think that would help you recruit more west coast volunteers.

  content: States offer their versions of some of the national training, and those
    virtual schedules are better for west coast volunteers.  But I'd suggest asking
    if those versions are ok if you're planning to work on a team here.
