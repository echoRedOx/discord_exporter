  content: 'Hi I was recently trained on phone banking and have a follow up question:
    I don''t see a response in the script for when a different person than the one
    I''m calling comes to the phone. There are lots of choices: answering machine,
    hostile, do not call etc. but if it''s just "not Joe" what''s next? Thank you
    in advance!'

  content: If it's a different person answering the phone and the person you are looking
    for isnt there right now, please select "busy/call back." If the person who answers
    says that the person you're looking for isn't at that number anymore, select "wrong
    number." Thanks!
