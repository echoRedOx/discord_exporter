  content: 'Oof. I think I understand, right around the 2:00 minute mark and how that
    would make our trans siblings feel abandoned and disempowered after being embattled
    for several years.


    Of course, I will bring this to the internal teams I am in contact with.


    May I ask you two questions?

    - When did you complete the form at the official campaign site?

    - What can the campaign do to repair and reconcile the impact?'

    \ the abortion issue. By and large I think that\u2019s smart, but the lack of\

    \ be some latency between requesting one, having the note be available to rate,\
    \ and the CN being published.\n\nCan I ask you to do two things for me?\n1) Moving\
    \ forward can you DM me screen shots? This way, we can reduce further harm to\
    \ our fellow volunteers (and ourselves)?\n2) While we cannot control QTs and the\
    \ discourse, what are some small actions we can do offline that bring care and\
    \ joy into the moment?\n\nI'll be on shift from 3-6pm (US-Pacific) today, but\
