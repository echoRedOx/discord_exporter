Content: Also, you can get oriented to the server at <#1268398483841220649> and <#1268398608097476750> which show a suggested workflow for your time here. Once you complete a text team training it can take up to a day or two to be added to the team. In the meantime, you can peruse our other channels, try out other team trainings, and chat with us in <#1242249109298221069> or ask any questions that come up there!
