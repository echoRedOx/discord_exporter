  content: Hi Jen! Great question and love that you want to share what we are doing!
    We prefer people to go through our program and trainings so they have all the
    tools they need to be successful especially if we are not sure how they may lean!

  content: "So, just to summarize and make sure: As long as we send folks to mobilize.us,\
    \ they should only be able to see publicly visible trainings and programs. But\
    \ non-public things are shared here, and we don\u2019t want those distributed\
    \ outside of the channels that they\u2019re shared on. That way we can make sure\
    \ people are in the best trainings for them to be successful, but also that non-public\
    \ info isn\u2019t going into public spaces?"
