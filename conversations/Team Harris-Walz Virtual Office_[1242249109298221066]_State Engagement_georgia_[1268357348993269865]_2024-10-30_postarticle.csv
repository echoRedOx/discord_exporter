I was wondering if there are any initiatives happening in Georgia with college students- specifically with registering students to vote (for those who can claim residency) and/or targeting Georgia students attending college out of state with how to request absentee ballots? That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd really like to volunteer my time!

Being the government librarian for an FDLP library, I have to host a Constitution Day celebration (all public educational institutions have to technically but our college is REALLY into it) so i contacted the e League of Women voters and they‚Äôre helping us run a voter registration table in the library. They‚Äôre really fantastic and bring tons of voter information. We worked with them for the midterms and it was a great turn out. Our SGA also is doing something but I don‚Äôt remember what their event is doing."

Phonebanking is our **number one priority** so close to the election, and it‚Äôs a phenomenal way to get started. We often set goals for specific numbers, like how we set a goal for 5 million calls this past weekend. We made 4.6 million, reaching immense numbers of people!
