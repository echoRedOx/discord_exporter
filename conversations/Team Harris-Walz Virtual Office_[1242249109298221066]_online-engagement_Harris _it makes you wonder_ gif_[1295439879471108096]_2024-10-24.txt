Content: Here's the alt text I wrote when I posted this gif on Mastodon: 

GIF made from screenshots of the NYTimes video.
Frame 1: Harris is holding her chin in the classic thinking pose. Caption: "It makes you wonder"
Frame 2: Harris is still at the podium, and an audience member to the upper left is holding *his* chin in the classic thinking pose. Caption: "It makes you wonder why does his staff want"
Frame 3: Harris is holding the podium, a faint glint of a smirk as she asks (caption): "him to hide away?"
Headline: "Harris Suggests Trump Is ‘Weak and Unstable’ in Pointed Challenge"
Subheading: "Kamala Harris asked why Donald J. Trump had not released his medical records, appeared on '60 Minutes' or agreed to a second debate."
Video caption and credits: "The vice president criticized former President Donald J. Trump, calling him 'weak and unstable.' Credit Erin Schaff/The New York Times"
