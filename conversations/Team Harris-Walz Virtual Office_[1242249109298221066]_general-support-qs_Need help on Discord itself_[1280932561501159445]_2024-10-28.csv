I am looking for help to figure out how to clear the red #2 by Kamala's picture on the left of my screen and the red ""2 new mentions"" at the bottom of my screen. I am very new (2 days) to Discord--and I just can't figure out what these actually mean and how to clear them out. Can you please help me? Or perhaps help me tag someone who can?
