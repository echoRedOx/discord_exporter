Content: I am involved in League of Woman Voters and refer people
to Vote 411.org  all the time - great source for all the candidates.  How come the candidates questions are not answered?   checked and they are not in Ballotpedia either.

Content: I am reaching out to Vote411.org (and Ballotpedia) they say I should reach out to the candidates.  

I tried filling out a form for the Harris campaign but it is not letting me submit - says it looks like spam.  

PLEASE - this would be a serious MISSED OPPORTUNITY to communicate with voters.    i know people who use these tools as their source of info (esp local races) and they say it influences their vote if the candidate didn't answer the questions.   (thankfully Trump didn't answer either.  in PA senate race - Casey answered, McCormick didn't..... 

Can someone get a message to the campaign to look into it?   I've reached out to Vote411 as well.

Content: I would try the form again and submit it. I agree - that's where many voters go for info. And it would influence mine if a candidate hadn't answered
