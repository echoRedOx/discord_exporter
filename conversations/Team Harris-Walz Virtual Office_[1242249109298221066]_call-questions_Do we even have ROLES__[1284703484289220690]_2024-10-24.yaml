  content: Hi <@482311755855429653>, I'm happy to answer any questions I can or point
    you in the right direction if I don't have the answers you seek. Regarding Roles,
    are you seeking to get involved in another capacity with the team? The feedback
    in your question, was that intended for the debrief on a phonebank yesterday?

  content: "Maybe roles is not the proper term here. In a former discord, basically\
    \ people would go to a specific tab and ask for what they want to be notified\
    \ about.\n\nThen mods of the server assign that to their profile and when another\
    \ person uses the @______ ALL others with that would be notified.\n\n50 states\
    \ are a must. \nPolicies are second.\n\nLike if I were to post an excellent meme\
    \ or a good video or a good Tik Tok, we want as many people watching it as possible.\n\
    \nPeople with friends will see it and then they can be persuaded if undecided."

  content: "As for your other original questions: \nThe campaign has a 2x/weekly *PRIORITY*\
    \ volunteer event called Latinos Con Kamala Phone Bank making bilingual calls\
    \ to voters! Per a fellow KC in <#1268378299428634727> chat, Eva Longoria was\
    \ the surprise guest last night! You can sign up to join here: https://events.democrats.org/event/647512/\n\
    \nThere are plenty of volunteers who also work with Beto's PXP (I'm one of them!)\
    \ but there are strict campaign finance laws we have to abide by as this Discord\
    \ is specifically for Harris For President. I recommend checking out PXP's website\
    \ for events & info on how to get involved!\n\nHappy volunteering!"
