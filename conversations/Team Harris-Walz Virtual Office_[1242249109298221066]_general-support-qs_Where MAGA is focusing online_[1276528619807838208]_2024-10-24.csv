Ex: I'm pretty sure they are specifically flooding the ""news"" section on the home page of YouTube with frankly weird lies (comments/upvotes) and brigade-downvoting pro-Kamala people who come into that space.

Idea: We could deploy some kind of resource to combat this with similar tactics or advise people on how to avoid engaging, etc."
