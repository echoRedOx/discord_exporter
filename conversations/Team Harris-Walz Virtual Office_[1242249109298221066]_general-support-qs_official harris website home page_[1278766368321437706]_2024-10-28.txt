Content: Can someone contact the administrator to the Harris website? They keep posting messages that they need someone from the campaign to contact them. Message gets bigger every day. Here is what the Home page looks like when you try to buy a T-shirt.

Content: That appears to be someone outside the campaign who owns the domain harriswalz.com. They'd probably like to sell it to the campaign, since according to news reports, they spent $15k to buy the domain. It's nice that they're at least forwarding to the official site, for now.

Content: If we're talking about fake sites (And that's what I came here to do) I'm assuming this is false and not a dime goes to the campaign

Content: It's likely that the campaign has grabbed all the possible URLs that someone would try, and the campaign is providing the redirecting.
