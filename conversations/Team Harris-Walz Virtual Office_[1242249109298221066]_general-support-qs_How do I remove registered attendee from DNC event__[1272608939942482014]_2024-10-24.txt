Content: I am hosting a DNC watch party and at least 1 attendee who is registered needs to be removed and blocked (offensive name and email). 

This is an official DNC event and the person registered through Mobilize.

Does anyone here know how I can remove, delete, and/or block attendees  or who I should contact to find out how to do so?  I will not be hosting an event if I can't control attendees.

Content: Is this on Zoom? If they are in the meeting. Go to the Participants list, mouse over their name, and choose Remove. They cannot rejoin from the same email.

Content: No this is in the attendee list of registrants. They've signed up through Mobilize and I cannot remove them.
