Content: Something weird happened with his discord account. He tried deleting his old account but his phone number was still attached to it. So now theyâ€™re making him wait 15 days for a new discord. I believe he got trained this past Thursday, and he has texted for the Biden campaign before. Is there anything we can do to help him start texting now or do we just have to wait the two weeks? Thank you ðŸ‘Œ

Content: Hello <@422535566697955329> I am so sorry your friend deleted their account. Discord says it takes up to 2 weeks to process that and then the phone will be free. If your friend has a family member who doesn't use Discord they can use their phone number to complete the verification and get back into this community.
