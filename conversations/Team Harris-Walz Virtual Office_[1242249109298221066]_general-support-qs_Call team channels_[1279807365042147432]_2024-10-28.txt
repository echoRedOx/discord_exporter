Content: Hi. I have been a member of the call team for a number of weeks and have been making calls successfully. I did my shadow call shift and submitted my debrief form. I do not have access to any of the call team channels including the resource channel, the question channel and the main channel where announcements are made. I plan to continue making calls and would like to have access to these helpful resources. I am committed to being part of the call team and am respectful of all guidelines. If I have used a channel incorrectly, please let me know and I will abide by all additional information I receive. I am doing my best to be a good member of the call team and am unaware of any reason I should not have access to these channels, but if I have misunderstood how they are used please inform me and I will comply with any additional information you provide me with in response to this post. I reviewed a lot of information about how to use discord, the virtual office and its many channels and may have misinterpreted some of the information.

Content: Hi Amy! I've tagged all call mods here so hopefully someone can help you with this. Also, be sure you click on "Team Harris-Walz Virtual Server" in top left sidebar and make sure "Show all Channels" is selected. Sometimes discord likes to glitch and turn that off even after we've selected it, so check first anytime channels disappear/aren't showing up for you!
