Content: I'm looking to volunteer for data entry and background work on the "Special Projects Volunteer Onboarding", but the only option seems to be taking place at 3 CST for me. I work in a call center and can't be off the phone for more than a minute, so I wanted to see if there are any other training times for that kind of work? 
Let me know if this is the right place for this question, since it's not really tech related ðŸ˜…

Content: I just want to add that (from my experience) so many of the trainings are set too early for west coast folks to attend them ( I work odd hours, so could), but most of them hit 3 or 4 pm during the workday here. If some later times could be offered, I think that would help you recruit more west coast volunteers.

Content: States offer their versions of some of the national training, and those virtual schedules are better for west coast volunteers.  But I'd suggest asking if those versions are ok if you're planning to work on a team here.
