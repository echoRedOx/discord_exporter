  content: I would point out that it was written by staffers who worked in the Trump
    Administration when he was President, and published by the Heritage Foundation,
    whose recommendations for the Supreme Court were accepted and nominated by Trump
    to the Supreme court. He's closely tied to both groups and many of those former
    staffers are going to be in his next Administration if he wins.
