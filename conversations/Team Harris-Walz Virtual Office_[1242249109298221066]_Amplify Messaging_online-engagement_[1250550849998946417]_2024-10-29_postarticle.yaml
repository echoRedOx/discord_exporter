    We pushed out **85** individual posts for amplification, and have had over 168m

    The best things we can do in the coming hours and days:

    - Post as much content about Trump being unhinged as possible

    - Continue to push out Project 2025 content, to show just how Dangerous Trump
    is

    - Contrast the different between Trump + Biden - a dangerous felon vs. a public

  content: If Trump had actually talked about the things he wants to do then it might
    have changed things in his favor with more Republicans or Independents.  But he
    is who he is and he can't help but keep saying all his lies. 2 more debates like
    this and he will only lose more voters. Biden just needs to keep repeating all
    his accomplishments and ignore what Trump is saying.

  content: I can tell you that the content creation team has been working a lot on

    had a huge draw among the youth vote.

  content: We should still enable people to read he whole thing because it covers
    so much. For example, I only recently read what it proposed to cut for service
    members and veterans. That wasn't listed in any abbreviated versions that I've
    seen and is very serious. That could influence the vote of millions of service
    members, veterans, and their families. https://www.stopthecoup2025.org/chapter-breakdown

    900+ page report (even I didn't bother to read).  However, I do have leisure time
    to read a 16-page Platform that's getting [positive press](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/08/rnc-platform-national-abortion-limits-00166788)
    for Trump's edits.

  content: It leaves too much out. We need to flood social media with as much information
    as possible. People don't know what they don't know, so we have to inform them.
    With the chapter breakdown, you can go straight to the chapters that interest
    you. For example, I am a veteran, and I wouldn't have known what they want to
    do to veterans and service members if I hadn't read that chapter.

    from France that seem like solid concepts:


    Choosing between a mediocre TV dinner and a nicely-present turd.

    Looks at the turd: "You have to admit, it''s well presented, with some red, white
    and blue."

    Looks at the frozen dinner: "I heard in the press that the dressing really wasn''t
    that great. And I''m told that it costs too much."


    A pitch to the youth.

    "We''re not asking you to choose the love of your life, but to take the bus with
    them."

    "It''s better to be frustrated with the left, even if it''s imperfect, than it
    is to find yourself alone against fascism."'

  content: 'To beat Trump, voters will need to be more disturbed by what a second
    Trump term portends than any foibles of the Democratic ticket. "All the Best People"
    is a stark reminder from unprecedented numbers of people who served in "Trump
    I" who left sounding the alarm, like Press Secretary Stepanie Grisham. Her story
    is especially compelling because she joined the Administration as a "true believer"
    but left denouncing Trump as "the ultimate con man" and warning that a second
    term would be "nothing but revenge, retribution and how he can benefit himself."

  content: "My suggestion to everyone is what Kate said in the online engagement announcements\
    \ and I also have a few suggestions as someone who has been in this game for a\
    \ while now. \n1. Use reputable sources whether they be from our guidance and\
    \ staffers or from a source with clout. Good examples of news outlets if anyone's\
    \ looking to share that are sources like Reuters and the Associated Press since\
    \ they are wire services and therefore they don't have any of the bias we're seeing\
    \ from many of the big ones like CNN. \n2. Don't use any inflammatory language.\
    \ This is not just because we're taking the Michelle Obama, \"They go low, we\
    \ go high\" approach right now but also because of something called slander. If\
    \ you don't know anything about that, I do encourage you to look it up. We're\
    \ trying to avoid anything that will make us look like a bunch of jagoffs basically.\n\
    3. I know this is a crazy time but there's a reason why we're taking the approach\
    \ we are right now and since I'm a bit of a social science nerd on top of having\
    \ knowledge of Communication and media, I think what we're trying to do it take\
    \ an approach of speak softly and carry a big stick. Now I know Teddy Roosevelt\
    \ was saying, \"Oh, I'll use the military if I have to\" basically but in the\
    \ digital world it's more like, \"We're going to post that uplifting content and\
    \ show we mean it when we say that we want to unite the nation but we'll also\
    \ remind you that our opponents are horrible people.\"\n\nIn other words: use\
    \ reputable sources, present the facts like we always did, and for the love of\
    \ God...KEEP YOUR LANGUAGE CIVIL! You guys are doing great so far so let's just\
    \ keep breaking through the noise and show that we're nothing like these people\
    \ that are causing all the fighting, division, and hate. Thanks everyone!"

  content: I had a post on threads, yesterday that has 42k views. It is the 'no idea/new
    idea post. I almost never encounter much MAGA response. The post got a lot of
    attacks from them, so I  blocked them. For quite a while it seemed like every
    block generated a new attack immediately. I always check a profile after I hide
    the content before blocking it to see if any evidence of persueadability is there.
    I note that a lot of then are very similar and often have cross conections. Are
    these bot accounts that are doing this?

  content: "I'm calling elected and candidate Democrats who express a desire to have\
    \ Biden back out. Here's my script. If you don't want to talk with a live person,\
    \ try calling at night or on the weekend:    I\u2019m not a constituent, but what\
    \ you do impacts my life. News reports say that you are asking President Biden\
    \ to drop out of the race. If that\u2019s true, I think you should consider that\
    \ he is probably the best president we\u2019ve had in a generation, in terms of\
    \ getting things done in spite of a lot of opposition from MAGA Republicans. I\
    \ think you should also consider that a lot of us voters voted for him in the\
    \ primary, thinking we actually HAD a vote in a real primary. I know it\u2019\
    s scary to think Trump might win, and we want to put forward the best candidate\
    \ possible, but we voters knew that when we voted and we overwhelmingly chose\
    \ Joe Biden. I really hope you\u2019ll come out in support of the President and\
    \ put these rumors to rest."

    their decisions. They're focusing on Biden's one bad debate while disregarding
    the 3 1/2 years of good he did for the country. Biden is completely capable of
    running the country for another 4 years.

  content: What in the actual heck???!? We need damage control now.  The amount of
    people saying they're voting for Trump now because we can't get our own party
    straight is horrifying.  Our own party members saying they're changing to independent
    after this election.  It's terrifying.  I am terrified right now . So many are.  We
    need words of encouragement or something right now.  All I can say is this seems
    like a mistake.  It also seems like it may be a good time to put in Harris Buttigieg
    however!

  content: I have been a Democrat since 1974. This feels like the Donorcratic Party
    to me now. I am considering going Independent. As an older person, it makes me
    very angry that his age and one poor debate performance was pounced on, despite
    his REAL, PROVABLE PERFORMANCE over the past few years. I thought age discrimination
    was illegal in this country. Apparently not for Presidents or candidates. Of course
    I will vote for anyone against Trump but I have cancelled all my donation subscriptions
    and replying STOP to all political text messages. But I can no longer trust myself
    to convince anyone after watching 14 million primary votes get tossed out so easily
    by the donor class.

  content: It is illegal, however, it doesn't stop people from doing it. Look, I'm
    annoyed too but I can understand the reasonings and while you argue donors, you
    also have to think about the court of public opinion because Trump did gain momentum
    between the debate debacle, the assassination attempt, and picking a young gun
    like JD Vance. There are so many factors in play here...and this is coming from
    someone who is more in the middle when it comes to age.

  content: "Hey all -- this afternoon, President Biden decided to not seek reelection\
    \ and wholeheartedly endorsed Vice President Harris in our effort to beat Donald\
    \ Trump.\n\nHere are key messages we wanted to share: \n\n- Vice President Harris\
    \ has spent the past four years as a governing partner to the most experienced\
    \ president in American history. She has helped pass and implement historic legislation,\
    \ and strengthened America\u2019s national security through her travels to more\
    \ than 20 countries and meetings with over 150 world leaders.\n\n- Her record\
    \ as Vice President builds on a distinguished career as District Attorney, Attorney\
    \ General, and United States Senator from the nation\u2019s largest state.\n\n\
    - No one is better prepared than Vice President Harris to prosecute the case against\
    \ Donald Trump. Her work as a prosecutor makes her the ultimate contrast to Trump,\
    \ the convicted felon.\n\n- Vice President Harris was part of the only ticket\
    \ to ever beat Trump, earning 81 million votes in 2020 as Joe Biden\u2019s running\
    \ mate.\n\nWe'll have more tomorrow! In the mean time, excited to be here with\
    \ all of you and doing this important work."

    \ 52 miles of poorly constructed wall, often just replacing what was there-  ProPublica/Texas\
    \ Tribune\u201DYet an accounting of border wall contracts awarded during his presidency\
    \ shows that his administration has failed to protect taxpayer interests or contain\
    \ costs and stifled competition among would-be builders, experts say. In all,\
    \ Trump\u2019s wall costs about five times more per mile than fencing built under\
    \ the Bush and Obama administrations.\n\nExperts say the frequent use of so-called\
    \ supplemental agreements to add work or increase the price has amounted to giving\
    \ no-bid contracts to a small group of pre-selected construction firms, many with\
    \ executives who have donated to Trump or other Republicans.\u201D And the funds\

  content: I want to know who to talk to about the Reach App and its content. I have
    had trouble in the past because Instagram specifically claims that I have posted
    false information. In addition, I have noticed that when I create my own content,
    people respond. When I post the Reach content, there is not much engagement.

    are ultimately persuadable.  Evidence of Vance's connection is building.

  content: "<@1247909990560301182> you asked us to report about online engagement.\
    \ I posted on Facebook in response to Vance\u2019s comments earlier this week\
    \ about childless people not caring about our future. I was especially offended\
    \ that he included adoptive parent Pete Buttigieg in his list of childless cat\
    \ ladies and responded from a personal place as an adoptive parent myself. I pointed\
    \ out that Adoptive parents deliberately choose to take up the responsibility\
    \ of care for a future generation. But I expanded my comment to a broader point\
    \ - Americans are generous, and loving, and perpetually optimistic and future\
    \ oriented. Don\u2019t try to shrink our national concern down to a craven and\
    \ egomanical world view. \n\nI got a lot of positive and vocal engagement from\
    \ people who were mostly already dems already and happy to comment that they would\
    \ be out and voting this year, but also from someone I was surprised by. They\
    \ seemed very connected and enthusiastic about tying democratic platform to real\
    \ values of caring and optimism."

  content: I'm also a parent through adoption and Vance's cynical and mean comment
    struck a sour note with me as well. I don't think you need to give birth to a
    child to care for the next generation. If that were true men wouldn't care about
    the future at all. There are many ways to make a family. The only important ingredient
    is love. Step parents are parents. Adoptive parents are parents. Foster parents
    are parents. Found parents are parents. Raising another couple's children is an
    act of compassion, love and optimism.

  content: Not to be that person, but let's try to be aware of the cultural heritage
    of Indigenous folks and the term "spirit animal." For those of us without that
    real background or experience, it's probably more appropriate to say "kindred
    spirit" or "guide" or "familiar." It's something that I personally have been trying
    to better myself on. We all can keep learning and that's great. Just wouldn't
    want to alienate someone from that background when we're all trying to come together
    for a shared goal.

  content: "There are a few ways to go around this\n1. This is not an easy thing to\
    \ do. I mean, you can't wave a magic wand and boom, it's gone. There's supply\
    \ & demand, shrinkflation, etc. Also, I think <@1266177007755198517>raises a great\
    \ point about how the problem really is global. For instance, I have a friend\
    \ who moved to Canada because of her job and one day she was doing the conversions\
    \ and realized that she's paying a lot more in Canada than the US. \n2. Trump\
    \ did a lot of things that caused a lot of this as we know. Biden inherited a\
    \ lot of economic mess and it wasn't all because of the pandemic. \n\nAlso, I\
    \ was asking around and <@1260983976483356767> pointed out to me there's some\
    \ things in the library on Reach regarding the Inflation Reduction Act which I\
    \ really suggest everyone taking a look at and sharing with anyone who talks about\
    \ this because I have heard this complaint from everyone...including my dad who\
    \ is VERY anti-Trump. The reason why my dad stopped complaining was because one\
    \ day we were in Walmart and saw several products we buy all the time with lower\
    \ prices than the last time. Also, I buy a lot in bulk and have been for years\
    \ but the last time I was in BJ's (it's kinda like Costco which I also frequent),\
    \ I saw prices on a lot of things being much less than they were a couple weeks\
    \ ago. We're seeing the impacts of the IRA but it's just taking longer than most\
    \ people would like."

    for combating the industry / lobby ... Thanks in advance for some direction.  BTW
    I spent the past day looking around and find no mention of this particular plank.
    Appreciate it.

    a lot of the stuff that we are for, the NRA is fully against.

  content: I've been trying to figure out if there is one to be honest because I also
    know registered Democrats who are gun owners. I for one am a Democrat and I have
    a legal carry permit in PA. I support common sense gun laws because I don't want
    some crackpot getting a gun. Also, there's something rather sus when you look
    at states like Texas that will restrict everything except how much fire power
    someone has.

  content: In my opinion nobody is a lost cause. I always try to understand exactly
    where people are coming from and ask questions. Then I give my perspective on
    things without judging or directly confronting. You cannot change one's opinion
    in one conversation, but you can in many, or if you are not going to have multiple
    conversations, you can always put a question mark, a doubt in their mind which
    somebody else might expand later on.

    \ was a good texting volunteer for Bernie in 2020 and sent literally 30,000 text\

  content: I can tell you from working as a field volunteer for years before I went
    to the digital side that not even field staff know when a rally is going to happen
    until days before but when we hear about them, I'm sure the staffers or one of
    the volunteer mods will pass on the info.

  content: I do believe they will send you emails on those as well. I know many campaigns
    do so keep an eye on your email. Also, one thing the party has done in the past
    and while I don't know if they will do this or not this time is they have also
    sent text messages if there are events near you.

  content: Graphic designer here - I personally don't see QR codes on websites as
    being very effective. If the person is viewing on a desktop and takes out their
    phone and scans the code they've moved from the desktop to their phone. I think
    its more effective just to put a link to where you want them to go instead of
    a QR code. I typically only use QRs in print media and physicial signage. Hope
    that helps!

    to commenting here. While searching for Harris specifically, Border/immigration
    isn't a filterable category. Searching for border produces 2 videos, and immigration
    only 1 (which was included in the border search results). Israel/Palestine isn't
    a drop down either. Searching for both individually produces the same video included
    in the border search results

    endorse if that makes sense. If you use hashtags to get seen by young ppl in spaces

    social media account at their disposal. It also helps in the sense that while
    people are still using platforms like X/Twitter (whatever it's called now) & Facebook,
    there are others that are using smaller ones like Mastradon and BlueSky as well.

  content: I'm actually starting to draft a bill suggestion i'm planning on sending
    to my representative Melanie Stansbury.  microblogging is an important way for
    our government to communicate with the public.  Especially during disasters.  What
    scares me is the thought of a company getting bought up or going out of business
    when our leaders need to reach us.  So I want her to suggest requring all government
    agencies and representatives to exclusively use open source platforms like mastodon
    that don't rely on a company.  The US can afford to run it's own mastodon servers
    (and does already in a lot of education settings).  That way we never have to
    worry about any of those nightmare scenarios.

  content: Since I'm talking about OSS, you might also tell them to read the licenses.

    might not be completely possible in a gov scenario.

  content: "Thanks to all who responded to me yesterday about QR codes.That was really\
    \ helpful. \n\nI\u2019m one of the creators in the volunteer content brigade and\
    \ I have another question for all the Online Engagement folks. We have occasionally\
    \ gotten some feedback as to what subjects you\u2019d like us to cover (Project\
    \ 2025, Kamala\u2019s accomplishments etc.)  But what we haven\u2019t heard is\
    \ how you\u2019re feeling about the content we are making.\n\n** Is there any\
    \ feedback you can share about what things \u2013 or even types of things \u2013\
    \ your people are responding/engaging to? **\n\nFor instance:\n\u2013 are comparison\
    \ graphics between the candidates helpful? \n\u2013 or infographics?\n\u2013 snarky\
    \ jabs at Trump/Vance/GOP?\n\u2013 graphics featuring quotes (either negative\
    \ or positive)?\n\u2013 memes?\n\u2013 positive photos, slogans of Kamala\n- negative\
    \ videos of Trump/Vance/GOP\n\u2013 positive videos of Kamala\n\n- Has anything\
    \ really clicked with your circle that surprised you? Or has nothing? And how\
    \ are the volunteer-made things comparing to other things you find online and\
    \ share? Is there anything others are doing that you would like our team to lean\
    \ into more? \n\nAnd lastly, a question for the leads. <@1256039311367999658>\
    \ <@941196169852366859> <@1054909991468929104> <@1184187512491618404> <@1263196733790224597>\
    \ <@1247909990560301182> <@1248274609086660722> \n I know views and shares are\
    \ a very inexact science, but Reach and Sosha and Discord all have analytics and\
    \ ways of getting feedback from volunteers. Do we have any data on what we think\
    \ might be working well and working less well at this point? \n\nThanks very much\
    \ in advance for your honest and constructive feedback. We have lots of wonderful\
    \ volunteers creating lots of different things \u2014 which we will all continue\
    \ to do. But personally, I think it would be great to hear how it all might be\
    \ playing \u2014 or *not * playing \u2014 out in the wild and how we can better\
    \ help you engage!"

  content: The Biden policy on Cap Gains I know (since I pay Cap Gains and depend
    on income from investments) were not going to increase for anyone who didn't make
    over $1M per year. It would affect very few of us normal people. I also had a
    phone bank call where they asked about Cap Gains. It's just a scare tactic w/
    inaccurate info. Those who make over $1M/yr have tax experts who help them get
    deductions to minimize all these taxes, which change all the time.

  content: On getting more engaged with faith communities, there is a program called
    Labor in the Pulpits which is done in congregations on Labor Day.  It usually
    has a person from Labor delivering a message.  In PA, that message might be about
    sustainable energy and increasing the union labor force to make that a possible.  This
    could be tied to voter registration and identifying voters for the Harris campaign.

    He lies so much and threatens others when lying... it is a pattern. Ppl think

  content: Lootboxes have some serious means of harming people vulnerable to that
    type of gamification.  On top of that, there was nothing holding many gaming companies
    accountable for the way they presented loot boxes.  Oftentimes, they would present
    the box as having a "chance" to win a high-value item, but in reality, you'd have
    to spend hundreds of dollars to pull the high-value item LAST out of the box,
    which shouldn't be the case if there were actual chances to win, as implied.

    side of Discord in your browser, will be all the servers that you are a part of
    (the sidebar in the box). Click one and you'll be on that server and when you
    want to switch around, this is where you go.

    things though Reach so also keep your eye out there as well. If you use the mobile
    apps, you can set notifications for both Discord and Reach for new content. Also,
    SoSha is our newest tool in the arsenal so check out that as well.

  content: 'I''m getting total dejavu here. Here''s why: I was a field & distributed
    organizing volunteer leader with PA Dems in 2022 and that year in the governor''s
    race, the GOP nominee, Doug Mastraino had ties to a social media platform called
    Gab which was not only far right but it was also anti-Semitic. That last one was
    a huge talking point because the Democratic nominee--and now PA''s current governor--Josh
    Shapiro is Jewish. Oh man...the GOP never learns, do they?'

  content: The same when I was in Spain. I was living in Gandia when refugees were
    stranded in a ship. Our city took in an amount that community groups could support.
    They were welcomed at the Town Hall and given Spanish lessons. Those that were
    able were given jobs in the city or community to offset their cost of housing
    and utilities. They were put on the social healthcare system and given vouchers
    for food and personal items. This helped the local economy as well. The Mayor
    and city council decided how many immigrants were allowed in the city. I had to
    register at the City Hall and the police department to stay past my 3 months and
    apply to the province capital for residency.

  content: "Hey everyone! I wasn't sure where else to put this, but this could be\
    \ big, and maybe something that we should keep in our back pockets as the Trump\
    \ campaign tries to distance itself from Project 2025. \n\nJD Vance is literally\
    \ the face of conventionofstates.com right now. If you don't know what it is,\
    \ it is Project 2025 without going the whole \"executive branch takeover\" route.\
    \ Article V of the Constitution includes two routes for amending itself. This\
    \ is the option that we have never used. They want the same thing as Project 2025.\
    \ They even said so here in an archived blog post: https://web.archive.org/web/20240802175038/https://conventionofstates.com/news/what-is-project-2025-a-plot-to-destroy-america-or-a-playbook-to-dismantle-the-ruling-class\n\
    \nI archived that link in case they scrub the blog post from their site.\n\nI\
    \ think it is important to get some eyes on this. Bringing light to Project 2025\
    \ has severely damaged the Trump campaign. If Convention of States gets the same\
    \ attention, AND Mr. Vance is proudly the face of it, perhaps this could energize\
    \ more democracy enthusiasts like myself : )\n\nAfter all, the distance between\
    \ Trump and Vance will be a heartbeat if they somehow win. Again, sorry if this\
    \ isn't the right place. I wasn't sure where else to get the word out. \n\nArchived\
    \ link with JD Vance as the face of Convention of States' website in case they\

    \ The momentum is with Kamala and Trump is flailing. There are lots of reasons\
    \ for optimism. But with three months to go, this is far, far from won.\n \nSo\
    \ we need to keep reminding voters who Trump is. And no one has more credibility\
    \ doing that than the unprecedented number of people he invited into his Administration\
    \ who left sounding the alarm.\n \nLike British-born Fiona Hill, the leading Russia\
    \ expert on Trump\u2019s National Security Council. Hill witnessed first-hand\
    \ Trump\u2019s fawning, creepy admiration for all-powerful autocrats like Putin,\
    \ Kim, and Orban.  She warns \u201Cwe\u2019re in a very dangerous moment\u201D\
    \ and that a second Trump term \"is \u201Ca path toward authoritarianism and autocracy.\"\

    the DNC platform when it is released to create posts like the one below.


    In short, I want to pull factual info/quotes from the documents to compare and
    contrast. Then attach screen shots of the relevant language from the documents.


    Does anything like this already exists? A lot of what I''m seeing in the Reach
    App are general, very broad, statements.

  content: Hi Deb. Thanks for being here with us. It looks like the staff has made
    that action card expire for us in the monthly points contest. HOWEVER, the video
    might still be available to you in the LIBRARY section of Reach. Look for that
    button next to the ACTION feed, then select see all RECENT CONTENT. (The videos
    have their length in the bottom right corner.) Perhaps it is there now? Or in
    one of the Galleries already? Thanks again. (In general, action items are moved
    to the COMPLETED section once you've marked them done. So sometimes you just need
    to click on the COMPLETED button to see them. Again, this one expired so you probably
    won't see it.)

  content: 'I have been looking for a side-by-side comparison of Harris Vs Trump to
    use with anyone on the fence, but I''m not sure about using this one.  It doesn''t
    feel like an apples-to-apples approach in how they compare the two on some of
    the issues-- look at "immigration," for example, where on Trump "side" it is just
    a quote from his website that begins with "Trump promises a crackdown on migration.
    His campaign website says: "President Trump will shut down Biden''s border disaster...."    And
    there is no reference to the disastrous family separations policy that were in
    place when he was in office, and no reference to his recently killing the bipartisan
    immigration bill so he could continue to blame Biden for issues at the border:  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/immoral-republicans-rebuke-efforts-kill-immigration-deal-help-trump-rcna135732'

    that was showing the rally (on live stream loop, and still is) and the video has
    a section where they scanned the entire stadium and there really were so many
    empty seats. I don''t know if it''s AI some of the right''s videos are posting
    but they''re claiming the seats were only empty before Trump came on but that
    is not true and can be viewed here, if you have any friends/family who trust you
    enough to watch it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5QW-WxscqE (can scrub through
    video to see the empty stands while Trump is talking). edit to add: Trump even
    talks about all the empty seats and blames the university staff.'

  content: Fears about dangerous immigrants is really big, sadly.  Also, a big focus
    on abortion as murder.  I think they have also been told to fear that Christianity
    will be outlawed.

  content: The problem w/ these side by side posts is MAGA is replying that these
    aren't taken at the same time during the rally and the Trump clip is "before he
    came on". It's hard to tell if that that's true or not. So the link I sent is
    unequivocal evidence of empty seats, which Trump acknowledges in his rambling,
    incoherent, long, boring, selfish, weird speech. So it can be a response to those
    commenters to send that link (and can share with a timestamp so it starts right
    where he's speaking then swings to show all the empty seats).

  content: Makes sense. In his endorsement of Biden, he begins by addressing a few
    things he "strongly disagrees" with. Then, he went on to discuss the many accomplishments
    and points in common. It was beautifully done, IMHO, and showed how we can disagree
    on some issues but still come together for the greater good.

  content: Alright. Here's what I got. There in all likelihood won't be a recording
    as there will be a lot of focus on listening and answering specific questions
    and less talking points. The official Harris Campaign YouTube channel will have
    loads of really good content if you're looking for specific videos and recordings,
    though. Probably not the answer you were looking for, but I hope this helps.

    Our concerns are basic. Food, shelter, transportation, and healthcare. We already

    that young people are rightfully concerned about.

  content: OOOh fair point - I think many would have no problem with going back to
    the Gilded age of robber barons and 16 hour workdays. But a lot of head honchos
    in the business world have come out for Harris. They prefer stability. Trump was
    very reckless with business regulations and it caused a lot of upheaval. Also
    the threat of political upheaval makes CEOs very anxious, and when they are anxious,
    they curtail growth, and cut costs. They infinitely prefer gentle political turnover
    and changes that occur through the political system, because that often increases
    rights and that opens up more revenue streams. So if he's worried about layoffs/lack
    of career growth, he should avoid reckless candidates.

  content: I am still trying to figure out the most effective way to message to the
    vast diversity of my state. It seems as if I must first pop the disinformation
    bubble that has held my state prisoner for the last 8 years. I am on my own which
    makes it even more challenging. Even when I share stories or information I know
    to be accurate (meidas mighty here) I am getting extreme push back. So....I am
    trying a variety of new things to see what may be more effective. I am always
    hopeful that the people in my own community will one day snap out of this delusional.
    I have tried stories of women. I was called a liar. I have tried videos of Trump
    and Vance saying it outloud  - same result. I have tried news articles. Same push
    back. Yesterday, I left a message in the group. It was very vague. It helps me
    to determine who is who in the community. I let them tell everyone exactly who
    they are - so....next step. Block bots, report threats, find my people, and move
    forward.

  content: "Okay, I'm going to pull out an old trick from my days as a field volunteer\
    \ leader and see if I can answer this. The best way to do this is to simply see\
    \ what issues matter to them. Engage in a conversation with them and then you\
    \ provide the facts.\n\nFor instance: let's say your friend talks about infrastructure.\
    \ They say about how they're afraid of a bridge collapse or if they take mass\
    \ transit, issues with mass transit.\n\nWhat you can do at first is connect with\
    \ them and be like, \"Hey, I get it. I was on the train heading home and I felt\
    \ like this thing was going to fall apart (or there were delays not to be believed).\"\
    \ or you can say how you are concerned because of recent bridge collapses that\
    \ caused traffic jams (we had this happen with a part of I-95 in the Philadelphia\
    \ area).\n\nNext is to tell them how the Democrats have combat this. You can talk\
    \ about how the Biden administration has pumped billions into improving our bridges\
    \ and mass transit. For instance, here in PA where I live, that part of I-95 that\
    \ collapsed was repaired very quickly and the mass transit system, SEPTA was able\
    \ to accommodate the overflow to the point where they worked with other nearby\
    \ systems to borrow extra trains to ease congestion on the rails. There was also\
    \ an announcement in the Philadelphia area that SEPTA is planning to improve the\
    \ cars on their subway lines and also, Amtrak itself has had massive improvements\
    \ to their stations, trains, and lines.\n\nBasically you're connecting with the\
    \ voter and providing information and trust me, it does work. For instance in\
    \ 2022, I canvassed in the town I live in and this one lady said about gas prices\
    \ which were close to $4 a gallon at the time in some places. I could relate because\
    \ I have a (small) SUV and I told her how John Fetterman wasn't going to pander\
    \ to big oil. It won her on voting Dem. \n\nHope this helps."

  content: I remind them sometimes the 3rd party candidates are not on the ballot
    in every state, like this year, it is statistical impossible they win. A vote
    this year for 3rd party candidate is a vote for Trump, all are the same side of
    Project 2025. It's my 2 cents.

    in a truthful, authentic way. Those aspects matter more than any facts (if it

    of negative attention - she's young and I'd hate to see her get harassed - I mean
    this sincerely! - I don't think she needs to be called out much more than this.

  content: I think <@260982275506700288> may have been thinking more about smears
    and rumors about their identity or past, rather than their platform. For example
    in one of the calls I made today on a phonebank, the voter was concerned for increased
    scrutiny and attacks on the LGBTQIA+ community if Pete Buttigieg was picked. Another
    example, Kamala's husband was forced to acknowledge an affair in a previous marriage.
    The right will attack anything, especially if it distracts from the issues.

  content: "Okay, this is bizarre but I think I have an explanation.  So, believe\
    \ it or not, \"Kamala\" translates in Finnish as \"horrible.\"  So when the text\
    \ was one word only, TikTok's auto translator didn't recognize her first name\
    \ as a proper name, guessed the language to translate that one word was in Finnish\
    \ and bingo!   I suppose the exclamation mark made it even more likely to mis-translate\
    \ this in the computer. \n\nSo I imagine it's not malicious or an error on our\
    \ part.  It shouldn't happen with any sentence that isn't the one word \"Kamala.\"\
    \  And I'd also imagine that auto-translators should start recognizing her first\
    \ name as a proper name soon."

  content: Mari, What a comfort you must have been to her! "Namaste," which, as I
    learned it, means "the light in me seeks the light in you." That's what it's all

    up on this channel and you'll see the "Drop the Hat(e)" meme posted this morning.
    I think you'll really like it.

    I discovered I need to take some more classes on disinformation, so signed up
    for more classes. Have been pushing out stuff from Reach to state FB groups and
    other social media sites. Just trying to figure out who likes what and where.

  content: I really like Walz. He's done so much for Michigan. All children have free
    breakfast and lunch. They do lunches during the summer. He's done a lot for education
    (he's a former teacher). He's done paid family and medical leave. If you get a
    driver's license you are automatically enrolled to vote. He's a great pick.

  content: Hi Delois, I appreciate being new here is challenging and may not be the
    right path for you. You can continue to engage with the campaign directly on Reach
    which is pretty easy, it allows you to choose content and then automatically shares
    it with your social platforms.

  content: "Really want to give a shout to the people running the online engagement\
    \ trainings. They're great. I went to parts 1 and 2. The best tip is that when\
    \ people react negatively to a post, even when it's just something like sharing\
    \ where Kamala and Tim stand on issues, it's better to just not engage. Move on\
    \ and do the most good you can with others. My instinct sometimes is to engage\
    \ to understand where the person is coming from. With only 90 days to go, we have\
    \ to be focused on undecideds, not those who would never vote for this ticket.\
    \ That really helped me, especially yesterday, when I posted about Tim adopting\
    \ rescue pets. Most people were lovely and it got so much engagement. And there\
    \ were a few who were just hateful. I just muted the hateful ones and it was absolutely\
    \ the right thing to do. \U0001FAF6"

    \ Trump-Vance is flailing. But the election still looks to be razor close, especially\
    \ in swing states.\n \nTo that end, I\u2019m pleased to report that the video\
    \ series is gaining attention across the \u201CBlue Wall,\u201D with Democratic\
    \ officials from Susquehanna County, PA, to Oakland County, MI, to Polk County,\
    \ WI, sharing the videos with voters. It\u2019s also heartening to see leading\
    \ news organizations reporting on the large number of former Trump Administration\
    \ officials who are not endorsing Trump in 2024.  In that vein, Talking Points\
    \ Memo just published a piece titled \u201CThe Democrats Secret Weapon,\u201D\
    \ identifying leading figures from the Trump Administration who are opposing him\
    \ now. And I\u2019d expect that the Democratic Convention, which starts August\
    \ 19, will feature former Trump officials who are now supporting Harris-Walz.\n\
    \ \nIndeed, an extraordinary percentage of Trump\u2019s former cabinet appointees\
    \ \u2013 almost 50% \u2013 are not supporting him in 2024. For good reason. Watch\
    \ (https://ourfutureourchoice.net/compilation/) as high-level appointees explain\
    \ why they left the Trump Administration sounding the alarm. And please share\
    \ this link with neighbors, friends, colleagues, and relatives.\n \nPlease also\

  content: I agree and wanted to add some ideas.  I was in conversation with a friend
    who said many of his co-workers are pro-trump, what do you have to say to them.
    I calmly said, I have nothing to say to them.  I have no need to try and talk
    to them, no desire to try and change their minds.  They are who they are. However,
    there are more of us than there are of them. My job is to make sure all of us
    are informed, registered and vote.  It ended the conversation easily and we moved
    on.  And oh my god do we all need to learn how to delete, hide or mute comments
    on our feeds. don't argue, don't engage, just delete.  They can have their "free
    speech" elsewhere. Just not on my feed.

  content: Stolen valor refers to taking credit for military service or credentials
    you didn't earn. Trump likes to pretend he earned a Purple Heart, for example.
    Some men parade about in military dress, complete with fake medals. It's an insult
    to those who served.

  content: I was just about to mention this. Also, Trump was given a Purple Heart
    from a vet who supported him and he said, "I always wanted one." Now I have an
    uncle who has since passed away but he was in Vietnam as a tunnel rat and he was
    awarded three Purple Hearts. He didn't go in saying, "I always wanted this," he
    got it for doing service to the country. Also, after the third time, he didn't
    want to go back because he told everyone that he knew that would be the one that
    killed him. He came out of Vietnam alive but in a way it did kill him because
    he died in 2015 from health issues related to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam.

    the Trump statement. I am unsure why they are stating that, I am aware he served
    in the Army, NG, to CSM, in 1/125 in MI, but beyond that I believe it's them that
    is mistaken. I am not sure what I am missing.

  content: I gather from the scans that he retired just as his National Guard unit
    was called to go to Iraq in 2005. Napkin math says he was ~41 at the time. https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/08/06/tim-walz-who-spent-decades-enlisted-soldier-brings-years-of-work-vets-issues-dem-ticket.html
    says he retired honorably. He has never claimed to serve in combat. He immediately
    went into the house of representatives and started working for veterans. This
    idea that he abandoned his unit is a big stretch.

  content: In my less than humble opinion, no debate should have a crowd. That's what
    rallies are for. During debates the candidates should concentrate on the topics,
    and an audience tends to be distracting. That being said, that's so much more
    the case with someone like Trump.

  content: 'Re: Message of the Day "Meet VP Pick Tim Walz"

    A couple suggestions:

    1. Please make sure these message of the day items get added as "Action Cards"
    in Reach. It makes it so easy to share.

    2. The link you shared goes to another video when the ad ends. I recall that it
    is possible in YouTube to create links that simply cycle back to allow viewers
    to replay the ad. You may want to use those features.


    Hope this is helpful.'

  content: A general question >> how can I be impactful in a blue state? most of my
    online communities are local to the Bay Area, and myself like to protect my online
    profile because I work in social media for tech companies and I want to remain
    non-partisan for fear of alienating coworkers or customers. the only place i let
    loose is my personal IG (which i keep private)  where i frequently post reels,
    images, and other news, etc. does anyone have any advice for maximizing reach?

  content: I saw an amazing video out of Tennessee where a very hopeful man was saying
    how they could turn their red state blue if every voting blue person just found
    one person to take to the polls with them to vote blue. I think that's an amazing
    idea! There's so many people who don't get out to the polls just because their
    day gets busy or they don't have transportation or they don't have somebody to
    watch their kids. If you could be that one person to help that one person get
    to the polls that day, we could flip these red States!

  content: I had a really interesting insight from the Medium posts I've written about
    Kamala and Tim - both around climate and environmental sustainability. When I
    focus on the story being about Kamala and Tim, not much engagement. When I focus
    on what they've done - the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and making Minnesota
    a climate action powerhouse - there's a lot more engagement. Not totally surprising
    since my Medium readers are focused on climate and sustainability, not politics.
    But it's an interesting learning to focus on the topic first in the headline and
    lead, and then connect to Kamala and Tim later in the piece.

    made me cringe. I don't think it's a good idea to call wearing eyeliner creepy

    be able to wear eyeliner if they want to. I think it's a distraction from the
    backward policies he supports.

    you might find it helpful to have the attached collection of fact-checking articles
    from 7-17-24 to 8-7-24. The links use bitly to make them very short for posting.
    The articles have been super helpful for Community Notes.  I draw from Kessler

  content: Hi Laura, I appreciate your opinion. We do reach out to redirect folks
    whose messaging distracts from our purpose. We encourage content that highlights
    hope, joy, freedom, etc. This is a community for everyone and we need to consider
    how the messages are seen/understood by everyone. On the flip side, there are
    folks who want to share the cringy messages with their communities and we don't
    want to alienate them either. It's a fine line, and we do remove items that blatantly
    cross it.

    \ Many won't know about the swift-boating of John Kerry, so this may need a one-sentence\

    it might be best to focus on a smaller patch? Most of us can't be effective everywhere.
    All of us CAN be effective somewhere. The trick is figuring out how to optimize
    (something I'm still working on).

  content: Hi Leigh, I know it's frustrating but we can't opine, as volunteer moderators/guides,
    on what the campaign's positions will officially be when they haven't released
    them yet. The campaign is so new. We do wish we could help on single issue talking
    points. You could refer to previous work and statements they've made if you want
    to research that, but we don't know if those will be their official positions
    after the convention. You could ask them to let you get those positions after
    the convention or talk about what they've previously said/done.

  content: since the DNC is putting together their platform now, the best thing they
    can do is call their closest Democratic representative and let them know who they
    feel - many people are understandably upset! but it's not worth letting it become
    a wedge issue, not when we have our representatives ears, and not when we're so
    close to sending a strong anti-authoritarian message. Apathy will not solve this
    - but I think it's also important to note that if you have close friends who feel
    strongly about this, give them sympathy. give them room to vent. Be a friend first.
    We've got 80-something days and a whole DNC to do. There's time to grapple and
    process. We have a wealth of compassion to draw on, and sometimes we have to show
    that first.

  content: Thanks much, Megan, for your thoughts on how to respond to those who are
    angry and disillusioned with the U.S. stance on the Hamas-Israeli war. Yes, give
    sympathy and space to those who say "no ceasefire, no vote."   I thought Kamala's
    response to hecklers in Detroit was too abrupt. She did meet with reps from the
    Arab American community before the rally, and as a result, an Arab American official
    is now supporting Kamala.    In AZ yesterday, she had a longer response to hecklers
    saying the administration is working around the clock to get a ceasefire & bring
    the hostages home. I am working on talking points on this topic, using AOC's wonderful
    response and Kamala's official statements. Many credit Kamala for having more
    empathy for the Palestinian's plight & stronger on the need for a ceasefire than
    Biden.  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/07/25/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-following-meeting-with-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-of-israel/  https://www.thewrap.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-biden-gaza-war/

  content: "Reposted from <#1260333091319451660> by me (this is more of a deep dive)\n\
    Little thing I wrote up about Tim's Nickname by Republicans/GOP\n\nWalz being\
    \ called \"Tampon Tim\" by Republicans/GOP is actually doing our work for us;\
    \ as we can see on this article by The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/10/republicans-tampon-tim-walz)\
    \ Tim Walz actually made mandates for Schools to have Free Mensturation Products,\
    \ The Guardians Arwa Mahdawi states \"...mandated public schools offer free menstruation\
    \ products in their bathrooms.\" Additionally, Mahdawi states that \"Tampons are\
    \ expensive! And \u201Cperiod poverty\u201D \u2013 the inability to afford menstruation\
    \ supplies \u2013 is a serious problem in the US.\" This New York Post Article\
    \ shows how expensive Tampons & Pads are getting (https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/business/tampon-pad-prices-nearly-double-over-last-5-years-due-to-inflation/)\
    \  As they have doubled the prices over the past 5 years. \n\nThe Menstrual Products\
    \ being funded by the State Government is **true** in https://www.house.mn.gov/sessiondaily/Story/17937\
    \ one of the many things the bill does is quote \"$3.6 million for menstrual products...\"\
    \ showing the bill provides schools funding for Menstrual Products.\n\nApologies\
    \ for this being legnthy, but in conclusion Republicans are actually doing some\
    \ good press for the Harris-Walz Campaign by naming Tim Walz \"Tampon Tim\". Despite\
    \ them trying to make fun of him with the name."

  content: 3:30 to 3:50 timestamps on leaked project 2025 video they quote stalin
    and hitler and then AGREE with them "if you repeat a lie often enough, people
    will believe it". Someone should clip that and then show clips of all of trumps
    major lies (with proof on screen that its a lie). I dont know how to do this,
    I'm sorry, but this would be a very powerful message to potential voters I feel.

    community contributions. If you know who the democrat donors are you can send
    emails countering the representative. Not sure what to suggest for the media outlet
    and the homeless.

    \ of hype about Kamala\u2019s rise in the polls and her crowd sizes at her rally:\
    \ What can we do to keep this momentum going. Surprisingly a Republican posted\
    \ an answer that made total sense. He said, \u201CKeep posting the excitement\
    \ and show how large these crowds are at Kamala\u2019s rallies. Post about the\
    \ well known Republicans who are endorsing Kamala/Walz. And most important don\u2019\
    t argue with Trump supporters online, not only is it a waste of time but also\
    \ because they like the attention. I would like to add that he also suggested\
    \ Trump memes are not effective at all in convincing republicans but I know it\
    \ keeps the excitement going and sometimes laughter is the best medicine for my\
    \ current followers supporting Kamala and Walz."

  content: so first off all, it wasn't a snitch hotline, it was a question hotline,
    for people who had questions about a covid, which as we can all remember, there
    were a Lot. Calling it a snitch line is a gross mistatement of an effort to help
    people who are feel more comfortable making direct phone calls, like many in the
    elderly population.

  content: I think saying Walz 'oversaw the largest covid fraud scheme' is a lie.
    A Minnesota audit was able to uncover the largest dollar amount of fraud of all
    the states, and all participants uncovered have been charged. Why is this being
    pinned specifically on Governor? Fraud was rampant - look at the Brett Favre situation
    in Mississippi, for example.

    1 and Part 2 Digital Engagement Training since I was trying torn and posting but
    also trying to engage when someone seemed a normies. And as someone said to educate

    *for the most part* at least on TikTok posting content might be the focus and
    not spend time commenting, right?

    \ of the erosion of our rights and national security we saw when Trump was in\
    \ office, and my dismay that so many remain under the spell of right wing propaganda.\n\
    \nDuring 45\u2019s term I realized that he was not intelligent or disciplined\
    \ enough to have reached the Oval Office alone, but I felt like it wasn\u2019\
    t only Putin/RU mafia behind him, that there were American teammates. Except the\
    \ alt-right, I did not know who. Project 2025 was the missing piece of that puzzle.\
    \ Heritage and something like 60 orgs were the policy brains that explained the\
    \ disconnect between Trump\u2019s actions and his personal character.\n\nIt is\
    \ going to take many of us persisting through adversity to maintain our freedom.\
    \ I see that now. Before Trump I had opinions. Now I have experience. And yes,\
    \ I am scared. But there\u2019s no good option other than to work."

  content: 'Unfortunately, you''d have to signup directly in those swing states.  In
    swing states, you can choose to volunteer with Kamala''s campaign, Congressional
    campaigns or even state campaigns.  Each campaign would have their own events.


    You can add those swing state''s channels here, but those channels aren''t very
    active yet.  I''d recommend joining the much larger [state groups](https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/groups)
    on FB and just ask the in-state volunteers for guidance.  It''s also a good way
    to familiarize yourself with the state''s issues, so their voters can''t easily
    tell that you''re not a neighbor.'

  content: I live in a swing state, Nevada. You saw the rally in Las Vegas last Saturday.
    Many of my friends were there. But that still leaves all of rural Nevada which
    is much more conservative. Campaigning there is hard because it's miles and miles
    of nothing but miles and miles. We have a coordinated campaign office, so if you
    want to help, just go to NVDems.com.

  content: "\U0001F9CAToday\u2019s Icebreaker \U0001F9CA\nWhat makes you motivated\
    \ to help out in this election?\n\nI was looking at this question and I started\
    \ thinking of a conversation I had with Colton today in a video call. I told him\
    \ how I've worked on campagins since 2016 and in that year, I worked as a field\
    \ volunteer with PA Dems in lower Bucks County. There was this little girl that\
    \ came in and she was asking for anything related to Hillary and I remember giving\
    \ her a piece of campaign lit we had that had Hillary's photo on it and the heartbreak\
    \ of seeing Hillary lose.  That's the one thing that always kept me going.\n\n\
    I did a lot since then from texing into several states in 2020 to spending the\
    \ 2022 midterms running phone and text banks for PA Dems during the week and knocking\
    \ on doors in Bristol, PA on the weekends. I still have the selfies of me with\
    \ John & Gisele Fetterman from 2022 along with a photo of me with then Vice President\
    \ Biden in 2016 and a photo of me and a group of field volunteers in 2016 with\
    \ President Clinton. This time I keep thinking it's different because we learned\
    \ from the mistakes of 2016 and we are taking an approach I only saw as a campaign\
    \ volunteer once before which was in 2022 with the midterm elections in PA. I\
    \ know right now we're also taking an approach which is very similar to Obama\
    \ but I keep thinking of the excitement of 2022 in PA and the heartbreak of 2016\
    \ and when Kamala said, \"We're not going back,\" I was like, \"And this won't\
    \ be like 2016.\""

  content: Just joined officially on Saturday, but I've been posting to my FB friends
    all year, since many are Republican and leaning family and friends "back home"
    (some of whom are at least reasonable and possibly persuadable), sharing articles
    with excerpts or my intro comments and also some memes, hoping to sow the seeds
    of doubt or show them how outrageous their leader is and how their party has gone
    astray.  I try to use sources with mainstream credibility (which means they'll
    still be accused of being "the liberal media"), and especially like to share articles
    authored by Never Trump Republicans/conservatives. I hit often on Trump's disrespect
    for military service members and his blatant immorality and, more recently, his
    incoherence and age. I've begun using some of the materials on Reach displaying
    the positive, upbeat approach of Harris-Walz and talking turn-out and its importance
    for younger voters.

  content: I live in South Carolina and have always voted but have also stayed pretty
    centrist- so it is rare that a politician grabs by imagination.  I remember when
    that happened in Summer of 2019 with Pete Buttigieg- I saw him speak at a rally
    on TV and the next day I went to what turned out to be the grand opening of his
    local campaign HQ and met one of his organizers, Kat Thames.  Kat taught me and
    her group of volunteers how to knock on doors and make cold calls and join text
    campaigns and we even met Pete together!  We worked hard and became very close-
    we are still in touch with each other.  Pete actually won our piece of South Carolina
    on the day of the primary!  We did something right!  This moment with the Harris
    Walz campaign brings those feelings back to me- we can actually turn this tide
    of potential disaster into something fun and hopeful- we can grow peace,  joy
    and belonging in this world!!

  content: I use ai at my job for fun internal stuff - it once took over an hour to
    get a drawing of a lion in a old-timey swimsuit. I think we're still ways away
    from dystopian nightmare deepfakes, and I hope there's some regulation soon that
    would enforce a watermark on any visual generated by prompt. When it comes to
    writing, I've seen it be very useful for the very tedious corporate technical
    writing tasks that wouldn't excite even the most eager intern. Without careful
    and determined personal effort, it cannot be used for anything remotely creative.

  content: I asked what was influencing this persons vote and they gave this response.
    "Christian values, the economy so working class can thrive again like they did
    under Trump, the open border crisis and the almost 100,000 missing migrant children
    caused by Kimala and Bidens policies, the fact we are almost in world war 3 due
    to their weakness. Boggles my mind why anyone who has lived through the last few
    years would ever consider that corrupt evil woman and her lying running mate.
    I choose to vote for freedom, peace, strength, and prosperity for the sake of
    my children's future!"

    by one, and sometimes people with this mindset don''t want to listen. Maybe start
    by asking what Trump policy benefitted them or the country and see if you can
    establish how Trump didn''t do anything for the economy except ruin it in 2020.
    I think that''s a good area to start in because economy is #1 this election as
    always.'

  content: hey so i currently have over 1K for my watch party monday night, and more
    as the day goes on, and I've been trying to get ahold of my local democratic party
    but after talking with the lgbtqia+ causcus liaison to south jersey, i was belittled
    and demeaned in a way that i no longer wanted to be part of the lgbtqia+ causcus.
    No one else from the party has contacted me, regardless of emails, phone calls,
    text, or comments in the NJ channel. I really feel like im being ghosted by my
    party and I'm just trying to get nj canidates infront of my audience. any suggestions?

    talk to my audience about how to get involved at a local level, the different
    types of caucuses, how to set those up, the importance of primiaries. Plus like
    the canidates policies, why we should vote for them, things like that. Just a
    regular interview and hangout session  where people can get to know and trust
    people. Or i wanted to stream the grand opening of a new HQ but thats tomorrow
    and I still havent heard anything

    reaching out and how i can help, she told me people only wanted a social club
    and until the youth show up we have no idea what they can offer. So i really didnt
    want to contune talking to someone that thought so little of younger voters. They
    also then told me I was judging them, making fun of them, and said it was because
    shes a "boomer" her words not mine. I can upload the emails but i just dont know
    what to do anymore.

  content: also, this isnt a judgement on anyone, but like, i wish i knew about these
    things before now. I only found out about the discord because someone on tumblr
    mentioned it because i talked about my problem on there. The liaison even expressed
    that we dont probably vote for the same reasons as she's a senior citizen. And
    i did express that I talk about better nursing home and end of life care facility
    regulations. More funding and science for Alzhiemers. Reducing the deffense budget
    to help veterans. these are things i activily use my platform for and to be told
    I dont care about the same things as her was just frankly insulting. She mentioned
    that they would like me to help get more volunteers to join, but then started
    talking about how no one wants to show up because its not a social club or a bar.
    I recommened that maybe a gay night at a local club hosted by the caucus might
    be a really good idea. Especially if the canidate was there. Like in parks and
    rec. people love that level of connection.

    a majority of my life, so i watch and heard about a lot of people dying while
    i sat there and did my home work either at the house with the patient or home.
    The elderly is something i VERY MUCH care about, because im very aware i will
    end up there with most likely a diagonoses for alzheimers. so it was just a massive
    slap in the face to hear her say i dont care.

  content: "1. **Clarification of Trump\u2019s Involvement**\n   - Many comments insist\
    \ that Project 2025 is not Trump's project and emphasize that he has publicly\
    \ disavowed it.\n   - **Examples:**\n     - \"Trump denounced having anything\
    \ to do with it.\"\n     - \"Trump said he didn't agree with some of the stuff\
    \ in Project 2025. It's not his project.\"\n\n2. **Attribution to Heritage Foundation**\n\
    \   - Comments frequently point out that Project 2025 is an initiative of the\
    \ Heritage Foundation, not something authored or endorsed by Trump.\n   - **Examples:**\n\
    \     - \"Project 2025 is a transition plan from the Heritage Foundation, not\
    \ Trump.\"\n     - \"Project 2025 was from a think tank.\"\n\n3. **Accusations\
    \ of Spreading Misinformation**\n   - Several comments accuse the original post\
    \ of spreading false information or deliberately misleading readers about Trump\u2019\
    s connection to Project 2025.\n   - **Examples:**\n     - \"Why do you lie?\"\n\
    \     - \"Stop spreading misinformation.\"\n\n4. **Suggestions for Fact-Checking\
    \ and Reliable Sources**\n   - Comments advise others to seek information from\
    \ more credible or authoritative sources, highlighting the importance of critical\
    \ evaluation of information.\n   - **Examples:**\n     - \"Do we remember the\
    \ difference between .com .net .org and .edu?\"\n     - \"Always consider that\
    \ when viewing anything.\"\n\n5. **Claims of Political Fear-Mongering**\n   -\

    \ elsewhere, bot.\"\n     - \"Don\u2019t fall for political fear-mongering.\"\n\
    \n6. **Dismissal and Ridicule**\n   - Some comments dismiss the concerns about\
    \ Project 2025 as overreactions or mock the premise of the original post.\n  \
    \ - **Examples:**\n     - \"Project 2025 is heritage foundation fanfic.\""

    \ \nI would check with various levels within your local party. You should have\
    \ precinct leaders, a county party, a congressional chair, a state party, and\
    \ the local campaign or another candidate. Find a down ballot candidate that wants\
    \ the captive audience. You could invite someone from your local board of elections.\

  content: Hi Charlie- I'm just another human but are you saying you want a candidate
    to come online with you DURING the DNC? That doesn't seem like a realistic ask.
    They are going to have stuff going on and if you are Watching the DNC- then how
    could you be interviewing someone? I'm not really seeing what you are envisioning.
    Maybe save that for AFTER the DNC?

  content: sorry for the delay, im streaming right now. but i wasnt trying to get
    them on camera the week of the DNC, i am WELL aware that is very hard to do with
    how busy everyone is. With streaming, I can have people come on at any time. I
    can stream all day before the speeches start and chat with people then, like a
    regular live stream. ^-^ I just like hanging out and chatting and all the people
    who signed up for the watch party know this. The volunteer sign up person who
    called me wanted to talk to the superdelegate at the local HQ opening tomorrow
    before he leaves for the weekend. The local chair was in the email exhange and
    other than that one Mod that reached out to me today, i havent heard anything
    other then the volunteer person telling me good luck and bye.

  content: like I know there arent going to be speeches going on 24-7 at the DNC next
    week, so I'll have time to kill between stuff so i dont end the stream to keep
    retention up. Its like a usual thing streamers do. If someone could sit with me
    and talk in my studio, cool, but i was only trying to first meet the super delegate
    at the HQ opening tomorrow. That was literalyy the entire point of the call/volunteer/
    sign up everything

    being locals to me, and a lot of people from texas for some reason (lmao) but
    its really fun and having something to yap about would be nice. My tangents about
    WWII are getting old XD

    I like to extend the concept to pages (or subreddits) that fall into this general\
    \ follower/subscriber size as well.\n\nSo for instance, you could sub to local\
    \ or niche communities on reddit and be ready as a resource to discuss Harris/Walz\
    \ plans that are relevant to that community, or the destructive impacts of Trump\
    \ and Project 2025.\n\nA hiking  or trail-running subreddit wouldn\u2019t like\
    \ the impacts to public spaces and parks, for instance. Neither would a local\
    \ subreddit like Project 2025\u2019s negative impacts on cherished local parks\
    \ and community spaces.\n\nOf course on reddit, this is complicated by some subs\
    \ that are hostile to/don\u2019t allow political posts. But you can still be a\
    \ resource in these micro-communities if the topic comes up in the comments."

    \ phrase. It's more accurate to say that Project 2025 was created for the next\
    \ conservative President, which is what the Heritage Foundation says.   It does\
    \ seem obvious that most of the people working on  P2025 would have major roles\
    \ in a Trump administration. The Foundation is also vetting loyalists who would\
    \ take over on Day One - also the day Trump says he'll be \"a dictator for a day.\"\

  content: First, the campaign uses "Trump's Project 2025" to refer to Agenda 47 because
    Trump keeps trying to disavow P2025 in favor of the latter.  Second, both Heritage
    Foundation and Vance describes Heritage's current mission as "'institutionalizing
    Trumpism" (which is why Project 2025's contributors employs over 200 people from
    Trump's administration, including at cabinet-level).  By the way, did you create
    the comparison table between P2025 and Agenda 47?

  content: Hi Roots Music - Good point about emphasizing that P2025 is meant to "institutionalize
    Trumpism." It's too late for this, but it might have been better if Agenda 47
    had been the main target. I got the chart on the similarities between Agenda 47
    & Project 2025 from one of the many twitter posts that used it in late July.  Did
    a little checking just now and could not find its origins.

    \ Trump being too old. I hear what others are saying about age discrimination\
    \ - it ain't about age.  Also, it ain't about memory. I found a great article\

    \ being much more important than their memories. Also found a health reporter\
    \ video on why Trump's lifestyle puts him at risk for cognitive decline. Would\

    \ post I put together:         Cognitive Psychologist: Biden and Trump may forget\
    \ names or personal details, but what counts is that \u201C Biden regularly displays\
    \ the deliberative dispositions that characterize good decision-making . . . [He]\
    \ has extensive knowledge & experience . . . & thoroughly investigates & discusses\
    \ diverse viewpoints with his advisers before reaching a decision. . . Trump has\
    \ considerably less experience in politics. He claims that he can make intuitive\
    \ decisions in a field where he lacks knowledge by using \u201Ccommon sense.\u201D\
    . This claim contradicts the research showing that extensive job-specific experience\
    \ and knowledge are necessary for intuitive decisions to be consistently effective.\u201D\
    \ https://bit.ly/3Xl4jKD A health reporter compares Biden\u2019s & Trump\u2019\
    s lifestyles that could affect brain health, describing Trump\u2019s heightened\

  content: Favorite moment in history? I have been privileged in my life to have seen
    many amazing moments. But the one that gave me chills and thrills was Nov 2008.
    I was on staff at the National Hq of the United Church of Christ. The entire staff
    of over 200 gathered in the meeting room with the giant TV screen to see the replay
    of the video from election night. We were simply proud that the country could
    elect him, but we were also proud because he was one of ours. He had belonged
    to a UCC church for a long time. Many of us were crying such happy tears. And
    here we are, again poised to elect a leader we can respect and admire. Let's do
    this!

    the late spring of 2004. Alan Keys (r) was running for the IL senate seat, and

    upset by his lecture that they went on to make his opponent, state sen. Barack
    Obama, President of the United States.

  content: This is a great idea. I recommend reaching out to your county Dems office.
    Most counties have precinct captains who are supposed to keep in touch with residents
    in their precincts. Doesn't always work that way in practice, but... Anyway, reaching
    out to your local Dems is helpful because it avoids duplicating efforts. Plus
    they can help with promotion, etc.  Good luck!

  content: 'todays icebreaker: whats the bes thing I''ve read recently-


    I recently found out through a sciencific study that mushrooms are being used
    to clean up industrial waste sites in california with a 98% success rate. Once
    the mushrooms suck out most of the toxins the life begins to flood back into the
    area at an extremely incredible rate. Items broken down and obsorbed into the
    mushroom include: Lead, Arsenic, and a canvas bag full of lubed soaked rages from
    a bicycle repair shop. Once the mushrooms are full or behing to dye they are scooped
    up and taken to a toxic waste incenerator, turned to ask, and taken to an special
    landfil for just that reason.


    Oh! and its being done by the person who started the "grow your own mushroom kits"'

    https://www.salon.com/2024/08/14/can-my-husband-find-out-i-am-voting-for-the-big-question-touching-a-nerve-this/


    Someone brought up that this could be a great opportunity for the campaign to
    have some messaging around ''your vote is your vote'' to give women who have partners
    who are for the opposition the reassurance they may need to vote their conscience.
    Just wanted to pass the info along!'

  content: I keep seeing the videos of MVP talking to girls (about 4-5 of them now)
    where she is so affirming and telling them they can do anything. She is also telling
    them to hold their heads up, look in her eyes, and shaking hands. It's so beautiful.
    Is there a video that pulls several of these clips together anywhere or a site
    to find them together. I would like to share with my groups online but I can't
    share 5 different links. Thank you!

  content: My favorite movie is "Under the Tuscan Sun".  It's about a woman who takes
    a chance. At the beginning of the movie dhe says all the things she wants. At
    the end of the movie another character points out she has everything she asked
    for - just not the way she thought it would be. Happiness is in your perspective.

    will i hear back from anyone regarding being ghosted by the DNC after reaching
    out to help? Like i was streaming this on my own for my job as a content creator,
    only went to the website to volunteer my time, effort, and audience to help. It's
    been nothing but stress since i reached out and frankly im so dishearted that
    i dont even want to host it anymore.

    is an all time favorite (and yes, I''m excited about the possibility of a sequel)
    and I love The Jerk because to me Steve Martin is a LEGEND (big Only Murders fan
    here). I also love Good Time but right now I''ve been watching Beetlejuice a lot
    because I really want to see the sequel.'

    Randy, too much ideology, not enough policy and realism.

    What is important for economic efficiency is not capitalism, but the price system.

    Interference with the price system by government OR BY PRICE-FIXING MONOPOLIES
    OR CARTELS are problems.

    Just now realtors who loved free market rents; just had their own price-fixing
    outlawed.

    The economic problem is not that Kamala''s father might have been a marxist; it
    is that Kamala is a lawyer involved the court system. The court system operates
    by commands of a judge (according to law and legal precedent) as such is a command
    economy. The command model is the wrong model for the economy at large at least
    with respect to prices, quantities and styles generally. Long term price freezes
    below the price clearing level destroys supply (cartels raising prices above market
    clearing also causes an efficiency loss through over investment).  Price freezes
    are only a short term emergency fix, the long term fix is breaking up the price
    fixing cartels through anti-trust enforcement or artificially increasing supply
    through subsidies.'

    \ How?\nHere are the main points of the summary:\nThe total number of unauthorized\

    \ million, a far cry from the approximately two and a half million reported encounters!\
    \ The number of visitors overstaying their authorized entry to the US is significantly\
    \ higher at about one million.\n\nEncounters include apprehensions, inadmissibles,\
    \ and expulsions. Nationwide encounters are, as of July 2024, about 170 thousand\
    \ a month, their lowest post-pandemic level. Border encounters are often confused\
    \ with \u201Cborder crossings,\u201D \u201Cborder arrests,\u201D \u201Cillegal\
    \ entries,\u201D or a myriad of other terms.\n\nThe number of undocumented aliens\
    \ living in the United States has hovered around 11 million for the last several\
    \ years.\n\nThe estimated legally resident population is about 30 million or nearly\
    \ three foreign-born legal residents in the US for each undocumented foreigner.\n\
    \nAbout one million migrants become US residents legally (half through family\
    \ ties) each year.\nEnjoy!\nJRM"

  content: Last time I looked into the issue - because I read that interview with
    Lankford where he asserted the 2.5 million number - it looked to be a willful
    misrepresentation. As far as I could tell it was a combination of 600,000 (which
    is the number of 'gotaways' that Sec. of Homeland Security Mayorkas cited in a
    hearing) + 1.9m encounters so far in 2024 OR 2.5m encounters for 2023. But encounters,
    of course, are not the same as the number of undocumented migrants making their
    way into the US and residing there permanently.

    To be honest, there are a lot who get it with the whole argument who are Republican
    and I always suggest people look at their arguments before trying to talk to the
    ones who are on the fence. A good one I always look for for this is Reed Galen
    who is one of the guys behind the Lincoln Project and he currently is the one
    behind its spin-off, Join The Union. I''ve been on Zoom calls with this man and
    he really knows his stuff. He also has a really great Substack if anyone''s interested.

    \ comparisons of Trump v Biden on the economy https://nyti.ms/3yq37LR .  You can\
    \ see him on MSNBC with explanations of his charts https://youtu.be/HKrcTQ6JA04\
    \  and charts on his twitter site https://x.com/SteveRattner Elon Musk has pushed\
    \ the idea that inflation comes from Fed spending, rather than corporate greed\
    \ and high gas prices [not in control of Pres.]  etc. Here is tweet I've sent:\
    \ \u201CBiden has delivered an impressive recovery.\u201D Biden was better than\
    \ Trump on economic growth, manufacturing, home prices, new businesses, health\
    \ insurance, child poverty & federal debt. Jobs increased more under Biden, even\
    \ adjusting for pandemic effects.  https://wapo.st/4cZ7QTT https://nyti.ms/3yq37LR\
    \  Trump backers who got him elected believed his falsehood that tariffs would\
    \ bring jobs back from overseas. They still don't know that tariffs cost each\
    \ family thousands. Trump plans high tariffs again & Moody's & Nobel economists\
    \ show how that would raise inflation & cost jobs,"

    work? Will people have the ability to live chat in the room they are in while
    watching? Will the link stream the DNC right in the watch party website, or does
    everyone have to use a different tab like YouTube to actually watch the DNC content?
    Also what specific days and times are most important to watch? I am organizing
    for a group of friends/community that are leftist leaning and considering not
    voting for anyone as a political statement. They are persuadable but it would
    help to have some suggested specific phrasings of talking points

  content: "Thanks Roby! Great job putting this immigration info together! Here is\
    \ an article that makes some of the same points https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/fact-checker-trump-harris-ads/\
    \  . I've worked on messaging about Kamala's role in reducing the underlying causes\
    \ of migration from El Salvador, Honduras & Guatemala.  I relied on two articles\
    \  https://wapo.st/3ABKjtI   https://ampr.gs/3WNFHIt    & the White House report\
    \ of the plan she worked on https://bit.ly/46SZmeA Here is my summary that can\
    \ be used for messaging [comments & suggestions welcome]:  Contrary to reports\
    \ that Kamala Harris was in charge of border enforcement, she was assigned to\
    \ work with 3 Central American countries, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras,\
    \ to reduce the underlying causes of migration to the U.S.  Migrants make the\
    \ tough choice to leave their homes & homeland  & head to the U.S. in order to\
    \ escape extreme poverty, gang violence & corruption. \nShe helped send more $4\
    \ billion in U.S. aid to those countries, including COVID vaccines. She obtained\
    \ the involvement of over 50 companies that have invested  $5.2 billion & created\
    \ more than 70,000 jobs. Columbia Sportswear, Nespresso, auto-parts manufacturer\
    \ Yazaki North America Inc., & others created thousands of factory & farming jobs.\n\
    Her efforts were stymied by entrenched gang violence & corruption. Nonetheless,\
    \ migration from the 3 countries during the Biden administration has fallen 35\
    \ percent, to a level lower than it was in 2019 under Trump. While encouraging,\
    \ it\u2019s hard to know for sure if her work on these long-term solutions helped\
    \ cause this decline. \u2013 Dan S"

    \ as CA AG: \"Kamala Harris learned a lesson about the border early in her career.\
    \ It\u2019s paying off now - As California attorney general, Harris found common\
    \ cause with law enforcement in cracking down on transnational gangs\" - Blake\
    \ Jones, 08/17/2024 https://politi.co/4fM4TIb   I learned a lot! e.g., she had\
    \ Republican DA's support and police support.  Attached are a few paragraphs of\
    \ article excerpts. Also Kamala is blasted for supporting \"sanctuary\" cities\
    \ when in CA. Attached is some messaging with scientific references."

  content: I'm a convention junkie. Have been since I watched my first, when Eisenhower
    was nominated. It was more fun back then because we weren't sure who would be
    the nominee until the roll was called. My favorite parts now are the young speakers
    and others who are not in politics, like the Khans.

  content: "Thank you Dan for your detailed reply. The clarification of the \"border\
    \ czar\" monicker is necessary. Working on countering the disinformation on border\
    \ crossings is paramount. ProPublica confused \"border encounters\" with \"arrests\"\
    \ in a report from last June. Even President Biden,\n in his speech last night\
    \ said, \u201CAs a result of the executive action I took, border encounters have\
    \ dropped over 50%. In fact, there are fewer border crossings today than when\
    \ Donald Trump left office.\u201D Not necessarily misinformation, but confounding\
    \ \u201Cborder encounters\u201D with \u201Cborder crossings.\u201D I have added\
    \ these examples to the pdf, as well as the following \"emotional summary:\" It\
    \ is straightforward. The yearly unauthorized entries at the border are about\
    \ 1/2 a million. Meanwhile, about a million people overstay their authorized entry\
    \ into the US. Another 1/2 a million people become legal residents in the US because\
    \ of family ties. The number of \u201Cencounters\u201D last year was 2 and a half\
    \ million, but encounters are not unauthorized entries into the country! No one\
    \ talks about Spanish tourists being a problem, one of the worst groups overstaying\
    \ their visas, or the many US citizens' family members who become legal residents\
    \ too easily. But there is an outcry about the inflated number of poor brown people\
    \ risking their lives to cross the desert to sustain the American economy. Why?\
    \ Because disinformation about a border invasion creates fear and uncertainty\
    \ and ultimately votes for anyone promising to fix the non-existing problem. Thanks\
    \ again. Hope we can counter the disinformation on the issue!"

    the speeches.  The Reproductive Rights segment was so powerful.  And when Joe

  content: Senator Warnock's speech last night was an important statement of where
    we should all stand. Not voting isn't a political statement, a third of the eligible
    population did not vote in 2016 - how did that help our country? Politicians listen
    to voters.

  content: I agree there were so many uplifting just plain wonderful moments. Hillary's
    speech, especially the part about telling her grandchildren "I was here!" AOC,
    of course! I loved the union support, cried at the abortion horror stories and
    really liked the mayors, so many smart, eloquent and strong women. But, for me,
    the moments that touched my heart profoundly were when the camera went to Kamala
    and we could see on her face the emotions she was feeling.  She is so real, beautiful  outside
    and inside. And then there was the final moment when she and Joe touched each
    other and looked at each other and had a private conversation. Whatever the words
    were we didn't need to hear. It was all again on their faces, the love, the respect,
    the shared sadness at his going and the joy of her starting.

  content: All of the speakers were amazing!  Biden's really got to me. When they
    were chanting 'We love Joe' they really showed him the love. I bet he's never
    had that happen in 50 years but now people are paying closer attention to our
    politics and representatives because we can't have a democracy on autopilot anymore.
    When he teared up I felt that. Very genuine.

  content: "I think a recurring theme/objection we will hear about Harris, is Inflation.\
    \ I think it is important to put Inflation into perspective. In late 2021, 2022,\
    \ everyone was expecting a recession. Flash foward to where we are today, it seems\
    \ the recession has been avoided, and inflation is closer to being in check. \n\
    \nHere is a timeline of related events.\n\n**2021:**\nStrong post-pandemic recovery\
    \ but supply chain disruptions arise.\nInflation begins rising, initially seen\
    \ as \"transitory.\"\nFed signals tapering of bond-buying as inflation persists.\n\
    \n**2022:**\nRussia-Ukraine war escalates inflation due to energy and food supply\
    \ disruptions.\nFed and other central banks begin aggressive interest rate hikes.\n\
    Recession fears grow as yield curve inverts, signaling potential economic slowdown.\n\
    Mixed economic signals with slowing growth but resilient labor market.\n\n**2023:**\n\
    Recession predictions emerge, but data is mixed; strong labor market persists.\n\
    Hopes for a \"soft landing\" increase as inflation eases slightly.\nFed moderates\
    \ rate hikes to avoid a severe recession.\nGlobal economic risks continue, but\
    \ severe recession seems less likely.\n\n**2024:**\nDebate over mild recession\
    \ vs. economic slowdown continues.\nCentral banks consider pausing rate hikes\
    \ to balance inflation control and economic stability.\n\nCurrently seems like\
    \ we're on track for a \"soft landing\"\nBiden: We're going to have a soft landing\
    \ on inflation\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=468840376115161"

    Published by \nRaynor de Best\n, Aug 1, 2024\nThe US dollar index of the summer\
    \ of 2023 was lower than that of the second half of 2022, although it was still\
    \ relatively high compared to previous years. The index \u2013 often referred\
    \ to with the code DXY, or USDX \u2013 measures the value of the U.S. dollars\
    \ compared to six other foreign currencies at the same time. These include the\
    \ euro, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, the British pound,\
    \ and the Swedish kr\xF3na. It originated in 1973, with the arrival of the petrodollar\
    \ and the dissolution of the Bretton Woods Agreement. As the index has only been\
    \ updated once \u2013 when the euro arrived in 1999 \u2013 some argue this composition\

    people to sign up for reach and discord. The only thing I didn't already have

    the ACA instead of understanding that the ACA was meant to protect us from insurance
    companies. It actually succeeds at doing so in a big way for women, as well as
    people in poverty and people with disabilities and preexisting conditions like
    diabetes and asthma!

    accept that the person you''re talking to is too far gone. A decent percentage

    They''ve stopped believing the things they do because of logic. And you can''t

  content: 'Hi Jim - Several reports are like this one from Newsweek: "Netanyahu''s
    office denied that the call took place. In a statement quoted by The Times of
    Israel, a spokesperson said: "Contrary to media reports, Prime Minister Benjamin
    Netanyahu did not speak yesterday with former President Trump"". Reports are contradictory
    on what Trump said, if anything. Some say he supported the ceasefire and some
    say the opposite  "Axios cited one source as saying that Trump''s alleged call
    was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the ceasefire deal that was on the
    table. However, the unnamed source told the outlet that they did not know what
    the actual conversation was." People might be referring to what Trump said to
    Prime Min. in July in FL: end the war fast [but did not mention of the ceasefire]

  content: "A couple things here (just in general - hopefully this is ok) \n\n1) Try\
    \ as best you can not to become jaded by the encounters you may have that are\
    \ negative or even frustrating. There are a lot of bots and spammers out there\
    \ and the accounts blend pretty well so it may not really even be a US Voter.\
    \ I've been an online moderator for almost 20 years and in that time you get an\
    \ eye for bots etc as you will see trends in the \"talking points\" that get repeated\
    \ almost verbatim. Also, sometimes its not about that specific person but the\
    \ potential thousands that may read their comments and never say a word. You may\
    \ not reach that person, but you could reach someone else that is undecided or\
    \ reading and sees your well reasoned points or appreciates the tone of your answers.\n\
    \n2) People are influenced quite often by online traffic/trends. So if things\
    \ seem to flow online in one direction, then people assume that must be right\
    \ and DJT has managed to control the narrative and direct it where he wants it\
    \ to go well and to full effect. If you read something enough times, you assume\
    \ its true and I think he relies on people having zero time to look all this up\
    \ and trusting on faith. IMHO he is abusing their trust. \n\n3) I find that sometimes\
    \ asking questions is the best way to go in cases like that. Ask why they feel\
    \ as they do or for more information on their views. If its a bot, they tend to\
    \ stop replying or engaging and if its a person then you tend to show interest\
    \ and the convo may go different and worst case scenario, anyone reading sees\
    \ you are showing interest/care.\n\nThat said, always good to know when to say\
    \ when (I sometimes admit to failing miserably on this so definitely easier said\
    \ than done) but do the best you can. (PS Also feel free to completely ignore\
    \ me too. I've never volunteered ever so not an expert on this by any means -\
    \ just talking from my general work experience.) No matter what, only ever engage\
    \ anyone as much as you feel comfortable. Its best for your own mental health.\
    \ (Just as a general rule of online)"

  content: Again, speakers last night gave speeches of a lifetime! Loved them! I am
    focused right now on the Israel-Hamas war & what's happening at DNC. In Michigan,
    100,000 voted uncommitted in Feb & many have not committed to vote in Nov.  Here
    is the DNC speech by the parents of hostage Hersh Polin https://x.com/martinlieberman/status/1826411913741226016
    In interview today on MSNBC [clip not posted yet], they said the hostage return
    now depends on the Hamas leader & Bibi. [Kamala was on the call this wk between
    Biden & Bibi - have not looked at read out] The parents expected  a neutral or
    hostile response from DNC but the love they got moved them to tears. I'll send
    later my doc on Kamala's positions, & progressives & resisters' responses & some
    talking points. Here is how the MI Demcast leader responded to DNC sit-in https://x.com/WhitchMI/status/1826456122355585128
    Many still affected by AOC's April interview https://www.thewrap.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-biden-gaza-war/

    especially Jaime Raskin, AOC, Hilary Clinton and Bill did well too. Of course
    Michelle and Barak Obama. They''re always good speech makers. Biden''s was ok
    and Tim Walz''s was very similar to his stump speech so I wished he''d said a
    few different things but all the same, his was short and sweet.

  content: Interesting ... I grew up 9 miles from the largest Muslim community (Dearborn,
    MI) in the USA and most of them understand the difference to their issues between
    Trump and Harris.  They overwhelming support the latter.  To the others I would
    reinforce that under Trump there was a Muslim ban and he unequivacally supports

  content: 'Here is an excerpt from an August 7 PBS interview with the Mayor of Dearborn,
    MI


    Amna Nawaz:


    Mr. Mayor, as you have seen, amid all the discontent, the frustration with the
    Biden administration''s policy in Israel and towards Gaza, we have seen the Trump
    team conducting a lot of outreach in Michigan.


    We know his former Cabinet official Richard Grenell, for example, has been on
    the ground and others. Is any of that outreach working? Is there an opportunity
    there for the Trump/Vance ticket?


    Abdullah Hammoud: (mayor of Dearborn MI)


    There is no opportunity whatsoever.


    They have certainly reached out to some members, but the individuals they have
    spoken with don''t represent or speak on behalf of the community in any regard.
    I can tell you that nobody who I have spoken with, even some of the conservative
    constituents that I represent, have also expressed great disdain for the Trump/Vance
    ticket, because they understand what a Trump presidency represents.


    This is an individual who is vocal about wanting to bring back a Muslim ban in
    new fashion and new order. This is the president who moved the embassy to Jerusalem,
    who eliminated all humanitarian aid relief toward Palestinians in the budget that
    he passed during his time.


    This is somebody that recognized the annexation of the Golan Heights and the annexation
    of illegal settlements. This is somebody that armed Saudi Arabia that killed 30,000
    people in Yemen. And so we very much understand what Trump represents as a president
    and that is not something anybody wants to see this November.'

  content: "Some of the protestors are not and will likely never be democrats, and\
    \ are instead part of the \u2018far left\u2019 (for lack of a better term). Though\
    \ it is a very small and splintered segment of people, there are people who identify\
    \ as various kinds of socialists and communists and who cluster in various overlapping\
    \ ways around political parties like the Worker\u2019s World Party, but also the\
    \ Democratic Socialists of America. These groups are extremely rigid, and to remain\
    \ in them one has to adhere to certain positions. AOC, for example, was backed\
    \ by the DSA, who have now washed their hands of her (in a dumb move on their\
    \ part) because she wouldn\u2019t refer to the situation in Gaza as \u2018genocide\u2019\
    .\n\nI\u2019ll only comment now specifically to the WWP and that mentality because\
    \ I used to affiliate with them in 2002-2003 when I lived in DC. The WWP uses\
    \ hot-button issues like Gaza to recruit activists and then proceeds to radicalize\
    \ the activists around a revolutionary socialist agenda. In my day they used the\
    \ War in Iraq and those huge rallies we had to try and prevent the war were organized\
    \ in part by the activist front groups of the WWP. Not that a large percentage\
    \ of the people protesting knew that or would have cared. We were all sincerely\
    \ against the war. Just\u2026 the difference between liberal democratic resistance\
    \ and the far left resistance to the War in Iraq was one of persuading people\
    \ to start voting democratic and support anti-war democratic candidates in primaries\
    \ and generals. In the far left circles I used to move in, we saw both political\
    \ parties as faces of capitalism and the main goal was to work to overthrow capitalism\
    \ and use anti-war sentiment to radicalize people for that purpose. \n\nIt sounds\
    \ way out there. But it\u2019s true. We had public activist meetings where leaders\
    \ from the WWP regularly spoke and over time slowly amped up the anti-capitalist\
    \ rhetoric. Meanwhile, behind the scenes for folks like me who were already essentially\
    \ old school communists, we had reading groups and read things like *The State\
    \ and Revolution* by Lenin, or stuff from Trotsky, and we\u2019d strategize around\
    \ the longer term goal of anti-capitalism.\n\nThe WWP is still around and one\
    \ can go to their website. They are doing the same thing with Gaza that they did\
    \ with the Iraq War. \n\nMany protesters, I assume, are not \u2018hard left\u2019\
    \ like this, and those who aren\u2019t will, I strongly suspect, will come home.\
    \ Those who are hard left kinda need to be dealt with the same one would engage\
    \ MAGAists\u2026\n\nFor me\u2026 I \u2018left\u2019 the Democratic party in the\
    \ late 90s, but then I came back in 2008, then truly came back (changed my registration\
    \ from I to D) in 2016. Obama, then Bernie + the Clinton general election campaign\
    \ brought me back.\n\nIn short. Don\u2019t sweat the pro-palestinian protestors.\
    \ I hope Harris/Walz address it, but I trust their judgment."

    the short response I gave to CarolC.  Michigan has come a long way -- so proud!  We
    have to stay postive and emphasize the common sense, decency, and dignity route
    to solving our problems.  I feel so good about our future if Harris and Walz wins.  We
    can accomplish anything if we do it together.  Unfortunely there will always be
    those we can't reach, but they are getting fewer and fewer with Harris/Walz!

  content: "Hi Caroline - Thanks for the full interview! A part of it shows how empathy\
    \ & support for resisters helps to bring them on board, as the mayor said: \"\
    it was the first time in a long time that me and the community felt an individual\
    \ such as the vice president humanized Palestinians, recognized the suffering\
    \ and even brought forth that Palestinians deserve the right to self-determination.\
    \  And then, most recently, as we have also seen with her V.P. pick with . . .\
    \ this is a governor who may be the only governor in the country who when the\
    \ uncommitted vote sprung up in his state as well, he congratulated the uncommitted\
    \ voters.  . . .And he recognized the situation in Gaza is intolerable, that the\
    \ party should be listening & . . . that we should course-correct  . . \"  Your\
    \ message to activists is very positive & reassuring --  I want to keep reaching\
    \ out. Am concerned that if  20,000 of the 100,000 stay home, which is progress,\
    \ it could still make Trump president. So I start with deep empathy & our common\
    \ ground with resisters -- 'My heart breaks also at the deaths of Palestinians\
    \ & the destruction of Gaza. I fear every day I'll see more bodies, men, women\
    \ and babies. I have deep, deep anger & sadness that I also sense in you. I hope\
    \ every day our demands for a ceasefire & humanitarian aid are met - NOW.  War\
    \ crimes have been committed by Israel from the start.   I want to keep my power\
    \ with a president I can influence so I'll vote for Kamala - with her, we will\
    \ live in democracy, not dictatorship\"  I know people who've gone from not voting\
    \ to a vote for Harris by listening to AOC : \u201CI would rather, even in places\
    \ of stark disagreement, I would rather be organizing under the conditions of\
    \ Biden as an opponent on an issue than Trump, who is not\u2026 he seeks to dismantle\

  content: Hi Malik - First, it's difficult for any president to influence inflation,
    and a major underlying factor - gas prices.  [this is not effective message],
    second Biden/Harris have done a LOT to control inflation-- and the rate of inflation
    is down last few month & wages have grown at a higher rate for a while. In the
    attached see how investment in child & elder care reduce inflation.  Third, Kamala
    will go a step further than Biden for example to fight corporate greed that is
    a major inflation driver.   See the summary of her recent speech -- she will have
    more detailed plans soon  https://www.epi.org/blog/debunking-5-top-inflation-myths/

  content: My state's channel was unaware there was even a FB Group, which is why
    we went ahead and created one without knowing there was already a group made.
    But I guess what I had in mind was having a big IN group, separate chats for counties,
    and then the party or precinct people could coordinate with nearby towns or counties
    in those chats or the big group overall in case they wanted to do joint events
    for something. Or gather students to volunteer on college campuses. Do you know
    if they do similar things for your state's FB group(s)?

  content: Hi - I check with YouTube to see if speeches are there. If I want clips
    I use Realplayer or other software. If the speech is on C-Span they have a clipping
    feature. For rural voters there is none better than Tim Walz --  the coach who
    worked on grandparents farm in summer. Go beyond his speeches to include photos
    like the one in tee shirt holding a pig & the video of him with daughter at state
    fair.  Short policy statements can be added. I found Gov Shapiro''s full speech
    in seconds and guess others will be there too May your work be filled with joy
    & laughter .https://youtu.be/HZRXjOBeJIA

    this year and I currently run a Twitter account with 16m impressions. I spend
    most of my day on Twitter while I work my full time job and go to school full
    time as well for Sociology. I attempt to use compassion and tact to pacify the
    verbal violence I encounter and my ultimate goal is to decrease the toxicity from
    the gaming community that led me down this path. MAGA abuse is my focus currently.

    going down. For instance, I saw a report on the local news here that said that
    homiacides in Philadelphia have decreased in the last year. What was that thing
    four years ago about "bad things happening" in Philadelphia that Trump said about?

  content: "Hi DJ - \"illegal human being\" --yes,  not your grandfather & not anyone\
    \ else! Amen! Sad to hear yuou had a Trumper go ballistic on you [and congratulations\
    \ on going 20 minutes \U0001F60E ] Glad to see this discussion on migrants. Have\
    \ been learning that autocrats -- Mussolini, Hitler, Orban, Trump -- use fear\
    \ of migrants as winning message -- and now even many democrats are turning against\
    \ immigrants. MAGA also bash \"sanctuary cities\".  Here is one way I have posted\
    \ on them: \"SANCTUARY CITIES ARE SAFE Trump continues to rail against \u201C\
    sanctuary cities.\u201D His Agenda 47 will block federal grants to them. Yet,\
    \ \u201Csanctuary communities\u201D are as safe as other communities, with no\
    \ difference in rates of violent crime, rape, or property crime. They are likely\
    \ to decrease crime because immigrant victims are much more willing to call the\
    \ police. They do NOT shield immigrants from deportation. Murders by undocumented\
    \ immigrants are heartbreaking tragedies but, fortunately, are rare. Such murders\
    \ in Houston, Athens, GA, Grand Rapids MI & Poweshiek County IA, were not in \u2018\

    \ \"Contrary to reports that Kamala Harris was in charge of border enforcement,\
    \ she was assigned to work with 3 Central American countries, El Salvador, Guatemala\
    \ and Honduras, to reduce the underlying causes of migration to the U.S.  She\
    \ built on her experience as a DA and Attorney General in California, where she\
    \ worked closely with CA police & prosecutors & their Mexican counterparts to\
    \ bring drug smugglers & human traffickers to justice.\nMigrants make the tough\
    \ choice to leave their homes & homeland to make the arduous & dangerous journey\
    \ to the U.S. in order to escape extreme poverty, gang violence & corruption.\
    \ \nHarris helped send more $4 billion in U.S. aid to those countries, including\
    \ COVID vaccines. She obtained the involvement of over 50 companies that have\
    \ invested $5.2 billion & created more than 70,000 jobs. Columbia Sportswear,\
    \ Nespresso, auto-parts manufacturer Yazaki North America & others created thousands\
    \ of factory & farming jobs.\nHer efforts were stymied by entrenched gang violence\
    \ & corruption. Nonetheless, migration from the 3 countries during the Biden-Harris\
    \ administration has fallen 35 percent, to a level lower than it was in 2019 under\
    \ Trump. While encouraging, it\u2019s hard to know if her work on these long-term\

    how his Agenda 47 has a lot of what Project 2025 does. Also this photo is proof
    that Trump may claim to back down but he still has his fingerprints all over it.
    He''s in this photo with the president of The Heritage Foundation which are the

    It started as a joke, but when one post got 33K hits, stuff got serious. I post
    a few times a day, giving them tools to take action. Today I reminded them to
    plan to vote early so they could be available on election day to either volunteer
    or work the polls.

  content: 'dont know if you''ve solved this but its also good to point out that trump
    is a habitual liar, and willing to continually do so if it gets him an electoral
    victory. he lied about stormy daniels, he lied about his father being arrested
    at a kkk rally, etc. he will do whatever it takes to get back into office. CNN
    has identified at least 140 former advisers from the Trump administration who
    are involved with Project 2025, including six of his former cabinet secretaries,
    4 appointed ambassadors, and his chief of staff. these are the people trump has
    worked with and is working with for his presidency. what he says has little value
    over what he does. "talk is cheap", as the saying goes

    whole family votes Democrat but this year they are so angry at Biden for supporting
    Israel that they will vote Republican. I pointed out that US military aid was
    only about 1/8 of the Israeli defense budget and that stopping that aid would
    make no difference. I also agreed with him that Netanyahu has to go but I fear
    that we have lost this family.

    to more chaos. But a lot of people will not recognize that.

  content: There is ONE thing she can do, if President herself. Call off arms shipment.
    I... do not think she can announce that now, even if she plans on doing it. (Even
    if it's good idea overall what with Israeli enemies in the region like Iran/Egypt/Saudi
    Arabia who want Israel gone for longstanding reasons).

    my palestinian friends and wish for the best of the region. There will be some
    folks who sit this election out. Maybe even in key areas, but remember - basically
    1/3rd of America didn't vote last election. Many many millions of those are in
    the center. To go to the left, we lose them completely. And for... sadly, sadly,
    a .05% of our population.

  content: "I'm super late to the the Palestine conversation. I just wanted to throw\
    \ in a vaguely educated response to why things are the way they are. Hi. I'm Evren.\
    \ I have a master's degree in international affairs (foreign policy) from Pitt.\
    \ I am NOT a middle east expert by any stretch, but I do know a few relevant things\
    \ that people need to keep in mind. \n\n1. Foreign relationships are very complicated\
    \ (as someone else said). We have treaties, agreements, and obligations that we\
    \ have to honor unless we meet very VERY strict guidelines for doing otherwise.\
    \ \n\n2. We have military bases in Israel. We will not just abandon them. This\
    \ is a strategic ally when dealing with the Middle East. Be aware: Caliphates\
    \ are not prone to human rights. At all. It is not a bad thing to keep an eye\
    \ on things. Look up the Ottoman Empire. Muslims have overrun Europe before. DO\
    \ NOT assume they are all keen to just keep to themselves. \n\n3. Mind you, they\
    \ also kill LGBT folk in their own countries and even young adults that marry\
    \ against their parents' wishes (honor killings). Muslims here are not the same\
    \ as Muslims there in all cases (not trying to vilify \"all\" anyone, just this\
    \ liberal bias towards Muslim protection will not be afforded to you necessarily).\
    \ \n\n4. Civilian damage should absolutely be minimized in any war. There is no\
    \ excuse for what BeBe has done here. He saw this as the perfect opportunity to\
    \ wipe Palestinians out. He's a garbage extremist and so is some of his cabinet.\
    \ We have to try to get a ceasefire deal. Period.\n\n5. We are not able to \"\
    remove him\" or take over. That is not however the world works. We cannot declare\
    \ war or any such nonsense. Whether or not anyone thinks Israel should exist,\
    \ it does (I am not a zionist, but I accept that this is where we are). We have\
    \ to deal with it now as it is."

  content: 'Well put Thomas! I tried making that point a couple days ago [8-22 3:09
    PM] - As you probably know, messaging gurus, such as those who teach deep canvassing,
    say we need to start with empathy & a search for common ground - there''s a great
    video of David Hogg going to a gun range & how he built a relationship with a
    gun owner. Here is part of what I wrote: I want to keep reaching out. Am concerned
    that if  20,000 of the 100,000 stay home [in MI], which is progress, it could
    still make Trump president. So I start with deep empathy & our common ground with
    resisters -- ''My heart breaks also at the deaths of Palestinians & the destruction
    of Gaza. I fear every day I''ll see more bodies, men, women and babies. I have
    deep, deep anger & sadness that I also sense in you. I hope every day our demands
    for a ceasefire & humanitarian aid are met - NOW.  War crimes have been committed
    by Israel from the start.   I want to keep my power with a president I can influence
    so I''ll vote for Kamala - with her, we will live in democracy, not dictatorship"'

  content: in this case though (e.g. online engagement and scapegoating Black voters),
    this is a longstanding issue of vote-suppression. Trying to get Black voters -in
    particular- to sit out a vote or shame us into not voting, etc. has a very long
    history in the US. Some of our precints STILL have to deal with 8-hour lines and
    violent conservative vigilantes patrolling polling places.

    not know why she was not allowed to speak. The speech did not call for an arms
    embargo & did not use the term "genocide". It included an endorsement of Harris.
    From what I know so far, really too bad she could not give the speech. https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/palestinian-american-lawmaker-denied-opportunity-to-speak-at-dnc-shares-what-she-would-ve-said-217900101846

  content: That's funny!  I will ask that too.  But I am also asking what will their
    life look like when Cheeto Jesus(I say Trump while talking to voters) makes drastic
    cuts to social security and takes away their healthcare and eliminates the ability
    to get overtime pay.  The impact to their quaity of life will be massive.  That
    is waking a lot of people up out of the trance.  I'll never forget the teacher
    in Wisconsin who was intererviewed after Scott Walker took away the right to collective
    bargaining for public workers.  She was a religious fundamentalist who had voted
    on only one issue - abortion.  She did not consider that she would lose the only
    pathway for wage increases and wage equality and her bottom line was, in the end,
    the most important issue to her.  Many people will be poorer if Trump wins.

    that was well-used in the St. Louis area where I spent a good part of my career.  I
    use social media to set up personal contact to do solid ASKS for the campaign.  I'm
    also enjoying checking in with old friends.  I like relational organizing in the
    digital space and face-to-face because we can move people into this campaign.  It's
    ALL HANDS ON DECK.  No time for policy discussions leading no where.  Now, it's
    finding our PEEPS and getting them into action for Kamala, Tim and other dems.

  content: At first, this may sound far fetched, but how about consulting primary
    sources? You don't have to believe what someone wrote about Kamala's speech--go
    listen to the speech yourself on YouTube. Want to know what Congress is up to?
    Look at current legislative activities at congress.gov  . Election results are
    published online by each Town Clerk (or at least they are in MA). Etc. Etc. I
    realize this isn't always a practical strategy, but if there's an issue you care
    about, you can usually find a primary source.

    to find like-mindeds on Twitter because you can search by hashtag etc. but IG
    I basically find myself clicking on the comments and following accounts that seem
    Dem-leaning. It's so much easier to do this on Twitter IMO but I feel IG may be
    more important! Idk. Anyone have any tips?

  content: "I hope when Kamala Harris gives her first sit down interview it isn't\
    \ with someone like Dana Bash, Jake Tapper, Jim Acosta, Lester Holt, George Stephanopolous.\
    \ \nThese people all participated in attacking President Biden CONSTANTLY for\
    \ weeks. While they gave Dumpty Trumpty a total pass for all his lies & complete\
    \ insanity! They give him free media, just like they did in 2016, to rant. Whatever\
    \ these things are they ARE NOT press conferences or interviews!\nIf Trump gets\
    \ back in it's going to be because our mainstream media treated him as if he's\
    \ just a normal candidate when they KNOW he is not!\nI would like to recommend\
    \ that she do her first sit down interview with Ben Meisalas of the MeidasTouch\
    \ Network. Almost 3 million people now subscribe to that channel & that's where\
    \ we get our news. It is NOT a Democrat or Republican or left or right wing outlet.\
    \ MeidasTouch is THE PRO-DEMOCRACY NETWORK! \nI'm quite sure Ben would do a fair,\
    \ respectful interview.  He has interviewed President Biden in the recent past.\n\
    Our media needs to learn that until they start being fair & reporting the ABSOLUTE\
    \ TRUTH (which includes NOT allowing other to use their platform to spread lies\
    \ & propaganda) they certainly don't DESERVE to be rewarded with interviews or\
    \ press conferences that they DEMAND! \nI know she doesn't need my advice but\
    \ I think when she sits down to talk it should be with someone who actually cares\
    \ about the truth & being fair. MeidasTouch doesn't say they are \"fair & balanced\"\
    \ lol, they simply say \"MeidasTouch because the TRUTH is GOLDEN!\"\nI hope someone\
    \ on her campaign sees this.\nThanks."

  content: I agree that mainstream media does not call out lies and outright crap
    spewed by Agent Orange; however, pissing them off doesn't improve the situation,  Kamala
    and her team will decide what to do.  She's one clever politician.  In the meantime,
    forget about that and get to your peeps to engage this campaign and to vote.  We
    win with our vote and we don't have time wasting energy on the opposition and
    their stupidity.

    and Joe have worked together on the ceasefire, hostage release & humanitarian
    aid. She has some daylight from but not much - she callled for ceasefire a little
    earlier for example & she's had more dialogue with resisters. Resisters liked
    her call for Palestinian self-determination in  DNC speech but understandably
    did not like her referencing sexual assault of Israelis but not Gazans. She gives
    MUCH more policy detail in her 8-25 statement -- I posted on this channel.  Most
    resisters are long-time Democrats who know very well the threat of Trump & reminders
    may not help & may be insulting [see CNN focus gp with uncommitted]. I will not
    create words to point out the down side of 1 issue voting but use the words of
    AOC [see my earlier post of her video], Bernie Sanders & others.  Dialogue obviously
    works. A prime example -  Kamala's conversion with the Dearborn mayor won him
    over. The refusal to have a vetted Palestinian speaker at the DNC who would have
    endorsed Kamala, may have cost Kamala tens of thousands of votes or more, e.g.
    Muslim Women for Kamala disbanded & will no longer back her. I suggest Kamala
    try hard to repair the damage- perhaps a major national event with Ruwa Romman
    giving her speech, hearing from the Dearborn mayor etc. -- basically for her to
    say what she did to protesters in AZ - I hear you and I see you.

    If you guys haven't taken the two part training yet, I really suggest it!! We
    covered how to approach an audience, with examples, along with how to use Reach
    to inform others, and how to recognize when an invitation to volunteer may be
    welcomed! So helpful and covered many of my questions!

  content: 'This is happening on YouTube as well. Some of it seems to be actual MAGA
    and some of it is almost certainly bots (just judging from account history/timelines/etc.,
    some common grammar mistakes, no profile pic, etc.)


    So I''d guess there is some kind of hybrid campaign going on (especially with
    the Ukraine offensive happening) by Russian assets to both provoke people into
    stating specific misinformation and stoke leftist infighting.


    On YouTube they are targeting anything that comes up in the "In the News" section,
    so I''d be curious as to the contours of the targets on TT and reddit, if you
    have any sense of it.


    I''ve been reporting accounts a lot but other than that the only thing I could
    think to do is apply some kind of counter resources. Kind of difficult to do,
    though.


    Report, amplify the people fighting back, respond quickly if you can, note where
    it was, a general sense of what was said, and how much there was.


    We might be able to get some investigative journalist on it as election interference
    stuff but I''m not sure how that would go trying to get Google to cooperate (a
    nonstarter with TT and reddit, I would imagine)'

  content: It's extremely similar to what I experienced in 2016, but with even more
    of a focus on leftist infighting than pro MAGA. "Vote third party" "democrats
    bad!! Jill Stein 4 President" type of rhetoric. I see it across every state subreddit
    I checked, especially when those subreddits allow for partisan conversation. I
    also see this infighting promotion a lot in comment sections of people who I follow
    who talk a lot about American politics, particularly women and gender non conforming
    people along with men of color. I see more pro MAGA stuff in comment sections
    on white men's posts. It's also quite noticeable when you come across someone
    who's an uncommitted voter. It's about 85% trolls when I start clicking on profiles,
    a really low number of profiles that seem genuine. Many don't have bios, or they
    have some weird profile picture and name, along with some other distinctive tells.

  content: When it comes to someone who is arguing in bad faith, or being aggressive,
    it's best to just tell them to have a nice day, or ghost them. We only have so
    much energy as individuals and it's better to spend our energy on people who want
    to be persuaded or informed than people who don't want it. I know it's not always
    easy to tell right up front, but when you feel like you're not getting anywhere,
    it's best to move on to someone who wants to hear the message. Best of luck to
    you friend!

  content: I had an unusual experience on Facebook. When I told folks there that I
    would be volunteering for Harris, my brother-in-law gave me some pushback that
    ended with him abruptly refusing to discuss anything. In the last two days his
    wife has begun to post pro Harris-Walz memes. what a surprise!

  content: I was wondering if there was a video archive or playlist of Trump and Kamala
    videos that show their stance on important issues. For example, if I am speaking
    with a Trump supporter that is not aware of what Trump has said about the constitution,
    I could share a video of that. Is there something like that? I think it would
    be a really helpful resource to help get clarity and facts around important issues.

    \ society, that I would never, and could never, amount to anything. \n\nI almost\
    \ believed it, but not quite. While still a teenager, I created a plan of escape.\
    \ I started spending time with people who lived stable lives full of purpose.\
    \ I earned my GED. I went to community college, where I became Student Senate\
    \ President. I worked tirelessly to improve conditions for the 40,000 students\
    \ I served. I did this while also a full-time mama, a full-time honors student\

    \ student, I graduated with a bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and Ph.D. For the\

    \ they do with their own bodies. The Democratic Party is the party of hope, because\

  content: I was wondering if anyone has good replies or discussion points to try
    and dispel the notion that because grocery prices are high that the economy is
    doing bad and its Biden / Harris's fault. I understand clearly our economy is
    doing great if you look at all the other factors but a lot of people only wanna
    focus on grocery prices because that is the thing right in front of them affecting
    them the most.  Any tips on would be much appreciated for helping to talk to neighbors
    as well as people online. I see it a lot in my FB groups and such.

    \ group. I posed a question and started a firestorm. I asked about Ss and Medicare\
    \ I had  over 180 replies and still getting them. What happen is 1 it was an uncensored\
    \ group with a rule that stated if you don\u2019t like it by pass it, well  apparently\
    \ they are censored and are voting to ban all political posts. As national elections\
    \ have no place in a community and only local and Trump and magna  post don\u2019\
    t count. I learned a valuable lesson here choose wisely what u post. There was\
    \ no political propaganda if you call links to the democratic agenda or even to\
    \ the republican agenda that is now considered propaganda. I have chosen to leave\
    \ the group along since it after discovering it manly trumpers. So I switched\

  content: I would also point out that bodegas and the like charge cost+. When Tyson
    hikes the price of chicken without paying farmers or packers more (gouging) that
    filters into the local store because it paid more for the product. A ban on gouging
    (if written properly) would hit Tyson, not the bodega. Similarly, big chains can
    negotiate for lower prices from suppliers in ways small grocery stores cannot.
    Failing to pass those savings onto the consumer or laborer (in the form of wages
    and benefits) is also a form of gouging.

  content: Right-leaning people are picturing a  gouging bill that exclusively targets
    retailers rather than suppliers and caps the overall cost rather than the margin.
    Corporate chains can absorb such a rule and small grocers cannot. (Such a bill
    would further solidify the corporate monopolies.)

  content: It seems the RWM (Right Wing Media) has resurrected an old story about
    Joey Piscitelli and DA Harris and how she refused to cooperate with sexual abuse
    victims of priests in the Catholic Church. My friend was incensed. I found several
    RWM stories about it and only 2 that explained her position. Sometimes I feel
    like I'm playing whack-a-mole.  I sent him the links to the 2 stories, pointed
    out her history with prosecuting child abuse cases for 3 years and asked him if
    he's read anything about Project 2025. I told him that Project 2025 was what I
    was afraid of, not something that happened decades ago. I haven't heard back from
    him.

  content: I have so many favorite songs depending on my mood.  Recently I had the
    pleasure of seeing Lucie Arnaz in a cabaret setting. She is in her 70's but still
    gorgeous and much more talented than I ever thought. She sings a song called "The
    Music in Your Heart" that I can't get out of my head.

    s worth noting that Harris has been working to curb it since before her run. As\
    \ of August 14, 2024, the inflation rate in the United States was 2.9% for the\
    \ 12 months ending July 2024. This is the smallest 12-month increase since March\
    \ 2021, when prices rose 2.6%. Also, keep in mind that it\u2019s in the best interest\

  content: Kamala's Handling of Priest Child Sexual Abuse Cases. Thanks for raising
    this Barb.  I've read several articles [can't find all of them now]. I believe
    her stance was that she could not legally release records in civil cases when
    informal requests were made by victims & she could not criminally prosecute.    You
    probably found these articles from this month - one on her toughness with cases
    generally & one totally trashing her. If you're up for it, would love to have

    \ It's in keeping with then DA Harris, and now VP Harris' respect and integrity\
    \ for the law.  She has never interpreted the law according to her desire for\
    \ what it should be. She works with what it is. But she has also been concerned\
    \ for victims and the accused. Her supporters call her pragmatic.  Corey Cook,\
    \ a political scientist and provost at St. Mary's College, and a longtime observer\
    \ of San Francisco politics said, \"She's [Harris} not an ideologue,, she tends\
    \ to focus on specific problems. \n\"The idea that she would have consistent positions\
    \ on issues informed by ideology isn't who she is,\" said Cook.  And   ... Harris'\
    \ focus on the victims of abuse and exploitation continued after she was elected\
    \ as San Francisco's District Attorney. \"I don't know what the term 'teenage\
    \ prostitute' means. I have never met a 'teenage prostitute.' I have met exploited\
    \ kids.\"  Harris then ordered her prosecutors not to use the term in court. A\
    \ year later, Harris sponsored a bill putting the crime of human trafficking into\
    \ the state criminal code.  For me, I see her position in the Catholic priest\
    \ issue as very consistent with her ability to make hard decisions and do unpopular\

  content: 'Additionally, some energy and pricing bullet points to consider:

    - Energy is a global market and POTUS has limited impact/influence in global pricing

    - Fuel prices were down in 2020 because countries world-wide were locking down/shutting
    down and thus decreased demand; OPEC cut oil production.

    - Once countries began to "return to normal", demand returned to roughly what
    it was BUT OPEC kept oil production roughly the same

    - The US has never been energy-independent; we have more permits/leases and are
    pumping more but we are still running at an energy-deficit'

    minutes [starting at min. 4:10) as a separate video clip for posting.  Some great
    quotes on hope & persistence could also be extracted.

  content: I have filled out my online engagement map. My engagements range from 4
    in my family to 12,300 followers on Twitter. I have to figure out how to do this
    on Twitter b/c my followers expect programming comments, not political. But this
    is too important not to leverage that audience. Can't wait for Part 2.

    Consider where your flavor and sector of programming might touch or overlap policy

    Examples might be:

    - Section 230

    - Cybersecurity

    - Consumer & Data Privacyl (e.g. GDPR and CCPA)

    - Quants and trading

    and the Conman."  Do you think such a video is effective in changing people's
    minds? I posted the link in a thread of NextDoor.com called "Local Liberals."  I
    got positive response from folks on that thread, but what really surpised me was
    that I received a congratulatory message from NextDoor.com administrators two
    days later telling me that my post had been viewed by 640 people. I was astonished.

  content: "Keep in mind a few things:\n\n1. inflation: The FED targets 2% inflation.\
    \ The expectation in a growth economy is that \"normal\" price increases are always\
    \ going to be 2%-3%. Too low, is bad for economic growth. Too high, is bad for\
    \ all of us consumers. Different sectors of the economy have different historical\
    \ inflation rates (housing vs medical vs college vs food/groceries).\n2. Vice\
    \ President isn't really capable of controlling inflation. President has more\
    \ control over that, but it's largely a function of Federal Reserve policy. I\
    \ also like to speak to friends about U.S. inflation versus other advanced economic\
    \ countries - U.S. brought down inflation much faster than every other country\
    \ in the world. \n3. Tariffs passed during 2016-2020 also drove inflation for\
    \ years to come on numerous products. A bike I bought my son at REI in 2017 was\
    \ about 30% more expensive just 9 months later after Trump instittuted tarrifs\
    \ targeted at China. We can agree or disagree with the purpose of tariffs - but\
    \ they absolutely get passed on to the consumer. Trump wants even higher tariffs\
    \ if he's elected in 2024. \n4. Harris is campaigning on combating price gouging\
    \ - this is not the same as price controls. \n\nThese talk points are only used\
    \ with my social media community - i don't get into this while phone or text banking,\
    \ and keep it much higher level. But, if you're trying to engage people who are\
    \ listening in good faith -  you can google some of what I said above and find\
    \ plenty of stories and data to reference. The bike story for me is really personal\
    \ because i couldn't believe how much more it was when I went to buy another one\
    \ for my younger child. The impact was quite swift."

    you do not have to be a policy expert. None of us do. Heck, half the time, even

    \ article I posted a few days ago that covers everything Taylor has said about\
    \ Trump. What do you think of this -\nTaylor is pretty quiet when it comes to\
    \ politics. But did you know she\u2019s had some things to say about Donald Trump?\
    \  In response to a comment Trump made during the George Floyd protests in 2020,\
    \ she posted: \"After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire\
    \ presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening\
    \ violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? We will vote you\

    for other discord servers. Plus, the Content Brigade has an application process
    so I'm sure they don't want their server shared until they accept the applicant.

    have their minds made up. I heard this clip earlier and thought yes!!  She is

    will try and work with the problem as it is today and find a solution is what
    we need. I, too, just left a positive message.

  content: So far, I've reported almost each individual contact and post online to
    the campaign via REACH.  I am proud to say that I was the July leader and am certainly
    in the lead in August.  I will leave that alone at this point.  I will now submit
    reports only to share effective ways of creating conversations and moving people
    into action.  This will double my real outreach (won't need to do so much reporting
    on REACH) and produce more effective connections/conversations with my friends
    and family.  I have a real self-interest.  Not only am I pushing important information
    about the campaign to friends/family, I'm actually re-connecting with a lot of
    people.  As a retired person, I have the time for this and it's f*ing awesome.

  content: 'RE Trump Paying for IVF -- one commentator said he''s tied to RNC platform
    that opposes IVF, BUT the opposite is true: "4. Republicans Will Protect and Defend
    a Vote of the People, from within the States, on the Issue of Life

    "We proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to
    the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied
    Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free
    to pass Laws protecting those Rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power
    has been given to the States and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late
    Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care,
    access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments)."        You can see how
    they have moderated. Best tact perhaps is to show him being proud of getting judges
    who overturned Roe that then allowed AL Supreme Court to ban IVF'

  content: "Hey y'all - I'm going to look into this a bit more at a more reasonable\
    \ hour, but I just got back from seeing some old friends I haven't seen in years\
    \ - center to right politics\n\nNo one tried to be rude or \"catch\" me in anything,\
    \ it was all respectful, just at the end of the night we wound up having like\
    \ an hour long parking lot conversation about politics\n\nClaims that I tried\
    \ my best to wade through while very tired:\n - Biden is currently mentally unfit\
    \ for office if Harris is stepping in, and the whole thing is shady\n - It's ironic\
    \ that Harris is supporting a \"border wall\" (I'd never heard of this and just\
    \ said she supports the bipartisan bill)\n - Protections against price gouging\
    \ and fixing \"did not go well in some other countries\" ie it's communist and\
    \ will ruin the country - I do not know enough about the policies or economics\
    \ to speak to this, though of course it's not what I think\n - There's nothing\
    \ to stop people buying and selling homes to raise the price of homes another\
    \ 25k if they know someone is going to be getting it\n - Something about the child\
    \ tax credit being $6000 one year, then half of that the next, then half the year\
    \ after or gone?\n\nMy friend said that his source for some of this is campaign\
    \ materials. There isn't a policy page on the website. May I ask where I can go\
    \ for policy resources? May I ask if anyone knows about any of these things or\
    \ has a good way to respond?\n\nThank you!"

    to mark these types of occasions? If I, the daughter of veterans, were responding,
    I might also add that T is a rapist, fraudster, traitor and convicted felon and
    that he is despicably using our fallen heroes for his own political gain.

  content: What are we doing about Pennsylvania?  I'm hearing there are no yard signs
    for Harris/Walz, but tons for trump/vance.  Polls are showing she's still struggling
    there. What can we do to help? I think she needs more time there. Besides the
    suburbs of Philly, where else can she eke out votes. Pittsburgh, Allentown, Reading,
    Scranton...none of these towns are growing. Her middle class/labor message might
    resonate if we can find a way to reach them.

  content: Right. The polls are basically all within the margin of error. But PA is
    pretty critical, and there are other signs that it's going slowly. I prefer to
    call it concern, not panic. And I'd rather be concerned now instead of after the
    election.

  content: <@&1252689433208291358> -  I am in the REACH Action Feed trying to download
    the video about Kamala being for working people (for my Facebook timeline), but
    when I try to download the video on my MacBook Pro, it tries to download it in
    my Windows Parallels virtual machine and says it fails. But, when I look in my
    Mac download folder, the video file  DOES show up. When I upload the video to
    my Facebook timeline, Facebook tells me it will take a while to upload because
    it is a 17MB file.  Why not simply provide a Youtube link instead of a uploading
    large video files at each social media platform? Is there a Youtube repository
    with all the links. It would be a lot faster. Please advise.

    sort of True Believer.


    Take heart. The first two are far, far more common and they''re trying to bait
    you into some sort of emotional reaction. As for the rare last person, be cautious,
    don''t let them take over the conversation with their rhetoric, and find a way
    to end the contact. Sometimes, people are just not ready to hear anything that

    As for the rhetoric itself, I''ve been hearing/reading similar for twenty (and

  content: Get your friend connected with PA Dems. They have phonebanks and more.
    Also while signs don't vote, local field offices are the best place to look. I'll
    tell you right now, there wasn't a bunch of signs in very purple Bucks County
    where I live in 2022 but it didn't matter. Also, don't look at those polls. 2016
    is a great example on why.

  content: I can understand the need to worry about Pennsylvania. Democrats are struggling
    not just in the polls, but also in the ground game as Scott Presler's team has
    been narrowing the voter registration gap between our side and the Republicans.
    Nonetheless, I do hold hope that Kamala will be able to reverse the tide once
    she and Walz return to the state and rally their voters there.

  content: <@1199911282623664181>  So based on Snopes and Barbara's excellent info
    there is no proof for them to say Harris didn't work there. She said she did and
    so theirs is just a baseless accusation.  Obviously this hits a nerve and they
    want it not to be true. As far as them taking notes, what are they planning on
    doing with them? I am hoping not, but sounding like Stazi in East Germany  getting
    people to report on others. Sounds scary, but it would be good to question the
    intent, if possible.

  content: I used to work for McDonalds. They do not keep the records long, but yes
    the owners may remember her, her parents, her friends, a photo, her word. it is
    from the mouth of the man himself, so I assume it is a lie and projection of some
    sorts, just another distraction for keeping me from doing my own work and helping
    us flip blue. They are afraid of me.

  content: So., we need a resource that just provides direct responses to the common
    b.s.,  like "McDonald's doesn't have a record of her".  It's ridiculous to have
    every individual Democrat have to generate a brand new response every time someone
    sees that (or others) old trope.  Would save millions of man hours to just have
    a template to work from, on these  common ones.

  content: This essentially has to be dealt with by journalists . Unless someone comes
    up with a bot campaign to fight disinfo on youtube, it's too much effort for volunteers
    to fight a couple of computers working arounf the clock to disseminate garbage.
    I've been working on a guide for collecting data to hand over to them as evidence
    of a coordinated disinfo campaign so they have less work to do to write an effective
    story.

  content: 'For YouTube, you want:

    - how you navigated to the page including what dection it was under if it was
    labeled. (This is for how they are targeting)

    - how long the video has been up

    - how many views it has

    - how many likes

    - how many comments (just the number, you don''t need to count the bot ones manually
    that''s too much work)

    - screenshots of the comments


    As you''re doing this you can report everything if you''d like. Again, the point
    is to collect data, not fight the fire yourself, but it always makes me feel better
    to do some reporting. xD


    I''m putting a guide together with examples but I don''t yet have a place to put
    it.


    Last note: important to remember they have to do this because they don''t actually
    have people naturally commenting on these videos, so it''s a sign of electoral
    weakness.'

  content: <@&1250537336639586325> I was on both (parts 1 and 2) training calls for
    Online Engagement over a week ago and I never received the slides and all the
    links that were dropped in the chat. I ALWAYS check spam and junk folders as well
    as Apple Mail blocked addresses and phone numbers. Why am I not getting the post-training
    e-mails? My guess is that the campaign itself blocked my e-mail ( joecarrtexas@comcast.net
    ) sometime in the past...maybe in response to me trying to limit dozens of e-mails
    each day from past Biden Harris e-mails. Can somebody go unblock my e-mail so
    that I can get the slides and links that are promised to me after I attend a training
    session? Thanks!

  content: I've been in technology for the majority of my life (I'm 57 and have been
    involved with tech since I was 10, so that should give you an idea). When Obama
    ran for President, I told people he was going to win, and win big, because not
    only did he have a better message, but because he recognized early on how to use
    social media to his advantage. I think that in 2016, Trump won because he figured
    it out and utilized it better than Hillary did. This year, I am BLOWN AWAY at
    how the Harris campaign is taking it to new heights by getting all of us involved.
    Trump is a social media organization of one (two if you count Elon). For fun,
    I went to the volunteer sites for both campaigns. The difference, like everything
    else, is stark and, like Obama, beyond having a better message, we are kicking
    *ss when it comes to social media engagement - and that's what's going to give
    us our first female President! This campaign is definitely where joy comes to
    live.

    requires using a my Google/gmail account, my Facebook account or a magic link
    sent to my e-mail, BUT... 1) The magic link never appears in my joecarrtexas@comcast.net
    inbox or spam folder, 2) using the Facebook account does NOT work, and 3) my main
    e-mail is my Comcast e-mail, not my Google gmail. My Discord account is my Comcast
    e-mail. Do I have to somehow create a whole new Mobilize account using my Comcast
    e-mail? Maybe my Mobilize acct was set up years ago with my Google gmail.

  content: 'Collecting this data could also be used once Harris & Walz are in office
    to inform policy in re: Data Privacy, Cyber Security, and the refinement of Section
    230. Kinda need to know the topography/landscape beyond corporations handwaving
    and asking to regulate themselves.


    To get a feel for the disconnect between where we are vs. what these companies
    are telling us vs. policy, I invite anyone to read Ch. 7 of P2025 (the section
    on Cyber and Intelligence) and download the text of the TikTok Ban bills, which
    didn''t pass.


    Anyone in tech and with a grasp of the basics, both are like badly written Bond
    Novels with consolidation of power under Trump.'

  content: 'For YT:

    1) I have no evidence this does anything. (If someone else does lmk)

    2) Yes, this is effective on your own videos. For other people''s videos, you
    want to thumbs down and report any comments on their vids (ideally after collecting
    data). For disinfo videos you want to make sure you don''t watch more than 20
    seconds of the video, report. But don''t thumbs down the video (that''s engagement)

    3) Leaving it alone is a solid option if you don''t have time or are exhausted.
    Collecting the url of the video would be helpful.'

  content: 'Hi Skye - Thanks for the suggestion about trying to subscribe to Mobilize,
    but Mobilize does not show me a "subscribe" option. Here is what I did: I first
    opened Mobilize in my browser and it already had me logged in on my gmail account.
    I then logged out of Mobilize so I could look for a subscribe button or option
    so I could set up an account using my Comcast e-mail account, BUT there was no
    subscribe button or option. Somehow when I take a training session in Mobilize,
    I never get an e-mail in either e-mail account... not even in my gmail-based Mobilize
    account which has settings set for me to receive e-mails via gmail after events.
    This has been really frustrating. Also for some reason, when I sign up for a Mobilize
    event, I only get the links by text and NEVER by e-mail.'

    PBS as it turns comments off. But for local events it varies, and I like to post
    Likes on duplicates, mostly for the optics.

  content: Those long posts are long intentionally. The length usually fills up the
    whole chat window  or a cell phone screen and are usually used to intentionally
    derail a conversation.  You can't win by arguing with those head on, so I suggest
    either responding with a meme mocking the poster -or- posting something that's
    either more "shocking" or funnier to derail that post.

  content: 'What gets lost in the shuffle is there was heavy defense investment during
    The Space Race of the 1960s + the Cold War, specifically with launching things

    This thing we''re using to organize was an old DARPA/ARPA answer to those questions.'

  content: "BIG OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE MODERATES\nI could use help engaging with people\
    \ on Lex Fridman\u2019s Youtube podcasts page to politely push back on Lex\u2019\
    s interview with Donald Trump. Lex has 4.17 MILLION subscribers, 1.64 MILLION\
    \ views of his interview with Trump and over 34,000 comments on this episode on\
    \ Youtube since the interview was posted 9 hours ago. Lex's audience has MANY\
    \ moderates, although most of the comments so far are supportive of the Trump\
    \ interview. The moderate viewers who regularly watch or listen to Lex are probably\
    \ a bit shy to comment against the Trump interview, so I think it would be helpful\
    \ if volunteers from our online engagement team chime in on the Youtube page for\
    \ this episode to politely criticize Lex for failing to push back on some of Trump\u2019\
    s major lies and to educate people commenting on the interview.\n\nHere is the\
    \ link: https://youtu.be/qCbfTN-caFI\n\nTo see my comments, look for my @joec143\
    \ Google handle. I politely criticized Lex for his failure to push back more aggressively\
    \ on these topics:\n\n- Trump suggestion that Hillary Clinton should have been\
    \ sent to prison.\n\n- Trump calling the investigation into Russian interference\
    \ in the 2016 election a \u201Choax\u201D.\n\n- No push back on Trump saying he\
    \ knew nothing about Project 2025.\n\n- No push back on Trump blaming Biden for\
    \ the messed up withdrawal from Afghanistan, ignoring Trump\u2019s role in that\
    \ mess.\n\n- No push back on Trump killing the bipartisan immigration bill because\
    \ he needed to use the wedge issue to get votes.\n\n- No probing on Trump\u2019\
    s Dec 2020-Jan 2021 conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n Lex also wants\
    \ to interview Kamala Harris, which I think would be good."

    if she watched anything about Kamala, she said no and she won't because both parties
    are liars. It's this attitude that worries me the most.

  content: Actually I listened to her and found out that much of their former support
    for Trump and I fear still, even though she says she won't vote for either, is
    that my son is a 50 yo white male who has worked for DOD for 0ver 30 years after
    spending 10 years in the Navy. She said, in tears, that he has been passed over
    for promotions 5-6 times in the last 6 years and the jobs went to unqualified
    DEI candidates. She said he feels totally void of all value. Her pain was real
    .We love each other very much and have agreed that politics will not change that.
    She and I have always validated each other's feelings.  Feelings aren't right
    or wrong, they just are. There's nothing I can do to convince her. It's just that
    I wonder how many others there are like her. And because she is the only one in
    the family who supports Trump that is willing to talk to me genuinely, I now have
    a better understanding of some of the Trump folks.

    she won't even give Kamala a chance. However, their entire group of friends are
    Trumpers. I posted a meme about all the things Trump did before the Afghanistan
    withdrawal with 2 backup sources and said these were the facts. Their best friend
    came back with "Not facts!!"  What can I do? Move on to someone that might have
    an open mind.

    w a positive emotional appeal and avoid proving them wrong. I think they're right
    about that. There's something called the backfire effect when you prove someone
    wrong.  They recommend we give up on Trumpers. We can't help them.

    I believe it was with CNN that she explained her current plan , allowing us to
    keep private insurance as well, where is a good place to look to learn more about
    that?

  content: Just wanted to share a tactic that I've seen work and had work with the
    whole Walz family endorsing trump thing.  You respond by saying how this just
    shows how Walz is even more like the rest of us in America.  Many have lost friends
    and family and have been divided because of a man who tries to overthrow our government
    once and will do it again in a heartbeat.   Then share your story about friends
    or family you've lost due to Trump.  It's really impactful and flips the script.

    existence of fellow Americans against each other because of who they are and the
    impact it has had on you and your family really seems to hit home.

  content: Here's why relational organizing in the digital sphere is important.  We
    need to counter the false narrative of the opposition and we do so with our trusted
    voice with the folks in our networks.  I'm from Western PA.  If we vote, we win.  Our
    people hold the key and we need to be engaged and ready to get out the vote.  That
    means constant contact for the next 60 days.  I've had friends say that I'm posting
    too much political stuff, and ten times as many friends have countered this claim
    with encouragement to do even more posting.  We also need to engage our friends
    in conversation and get them engaged.  I've now had over 500 conversations with
    people in my network confirming their vote and encouraging them to download REACH
    and get to work.  So far, over 30 of my friends have downloaded the app and are
    doing organizing for the campaign.  I am reaching out in my neighborhood, in my
    faith groups, in my social groups, and in my political groups.  I will leave no
    stone unturned in my networks.  We are the ones we've been waiting for.  If we
    don't want Agent Orange in the White House destroying democracy and threatening
    our children's future and our present, the time for engagement is NOW.  Let's
    get our friends and family on REACH and help them to use their voice in the digital
    sphere and in face-to-face conversations with their friends.

    County is it Steve Cohen or Mayor Strickland and I wonder if Steve Cohen ever
    supported Donald Trump as well for things to go so sour and for our physical beings
    to feel like after a affliction or trauma that we are to continue to struggle
    and suffer and to withhold necessary benefits and information for the personal
    individual to move to move forward...it's open because for him to donate 300,000
    towards victims but for the withheld information to not be considered for the
    individual victims to have the perpetrator apprehended and the material such as
    police cameras to not be considered or even looked upon and then have a timeline
    to were nothing can be identified is a inside job...

    win this November, but it won't do any good unless it gets read!  I don't write

    all this information and compiled it in a way that I thought people would find

  content: Thanks so much for your willingness to jump in.  There are some fb groups
    like Faithful American Pennsylvania Cohort whose posts can be shared.  There are
    probably other groups on various social media platforms whose posts can be shared
    or liked.

  content: I need some help. I took the training where we talked about acknowledge,
    bridge and counter. I need suggestions on how. I posted about Trump and Project
    2025 and got a response "Trump is NOT supporting Project 2025." Just that. I started
    with saying to her I understand there are millions who agree with you. And I know
    that all of us are concerned  about the future of our country. Now I'm stuck on
    what to say next to do the bridge part. Any ideas?

  content: When I post stuff to facebook or linkedin or x or my email groups, I'm
    looking for friends to have a conversation with.  Sometimes, its a message conversation
    on fb or linkedin or an email where a person confirms their support.  When I confirm
    their support, I want to encourage them to do online organizing using REACH and
    DISCORD, really mostly REACH.  As I assess my networks, I'm especially looking
    for people who have extensive personal networks, and are active on the platform.  These
    are folks who can amplify messages and encourage others to get engaged.  My goal
    is to get folks to participate.  As Michelle Obama said, "DO SOMETHING."  We have
    to do this NOW as there is no time to waste.  The opposition has a strong foothold
    in PA (where I'm doing my organizing) and we need to find those people and networks
    in our strongholds of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and especially surrounding suburbs
    in these two urban areas.  We're told that those suburbs hold the key to victory.  Let's
    find our peeps there and move them into action.

  content: 'I''m a whiskey drinker and tonight, we will have a Whiskey Sip ''n Share
    Fundraiser for Kamala and Tim.  We have $5K in and counting.  Those who show up
    will have their pick of 22 beautiful whiskies from around the world:  bourbons
    from Kentucky, Whiskies from the center of the Whisky Universe - Islay, exquisite
    Japanese and Irish Whiskies, and specially crafted stuff from Australia.  This
    event was a part of my "relational organizing" process.  I needed to have something
    folks could rally around in my community and my emails/contacts of this group
    (especially those who stepped up to be hosts at higher giving levels) are now
    my targets for more engagement online.  Many have downloaded REACH.  I will get
    more to do so tonight.'

  content: YouTube has a playlist of [Reach tutorials](https://www.reach.vote/knowledge-base/category/guides/video-guides/).  People
    who have completed a Reach training are familiar with the first two parts of the
    playlist.  Part 5 is relational organizing, which is what you're doing.  If your
    contacts do the same relational organizing, then Reach's user base will expand
    to your contacts' networks.

  content: Exactly.  I have not yet organized a personal REACH training but I've been
    thinking about doing so for my immediate friends, neighbors and contacts in Pittsburgh.  I
    also have groups of folks who might be interested.  Sometimes, it's hard to get
    folks motivated to attend the campaign's trainings.  I might be able to make it
    a bit easier for them to get on board.

    of being stiffed by Trump in the building of Trump''s short lived Taj Mahal in
    Atlantic City. He is a blue dot in an extremely red area. HIs neighbors, including
    many seniors, are very anti-government and for that reason, even against their
    own self interest, support Trump. HIS MESSAGING SUGGESTION: We need to address
    this anti-government sentiment if we ever want to break through to these people.
    Those who benefit/depend on Social Security, Medicare if they are older or approaching
    retirement. Those that used the GI Bill for service members to go to college,
    like Coach Walz and JD Vance. Those that receive food assistance. FEMA and the
    National Guard to help recover from disasters and rebiuld communities, etc.'

  content: I have a pretty small network (introvert, what can I say?) but I've been
    posting snippets here and there from whatever campaign volunteering I'm doing
    and have had three different people reach out to me privately asking for more
    info on how they can get involved too. Every little bit helps and you don't know
    when you're going to reach someone at the right moment.

  content: Looking forward to the Online Lead Interest Meeting later this afternoon.
    Not sure if I can post the Zoom link here, so I will just include the email for
    now. If you have any questions, you can email digitalorganizing@dnc.org. Hopefully,
    there will be multiple sessions. I think this is my first post in this channel,
    so by way of introduction, I post content in an official group FB Harris for Texas
    as mod, and in LGBT for Harris, an unofficial group, as a member.

    sources. Just saying Trump did something similar won't help (imo) because people
    are already overloaded with hearing about all the awful things he has done, is
    doing, and will do if he can.

    wouldn't help, somebody went out and dug up a bunch of highly relevant information.
    I stand corrected! Trump has let all kinds of crazed criminals back into society,
    only to have them commit more crimes! Here is the article - hopefully this information
    can be shared far and wide! https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/9/8/2268629/-Let-s-Turn-the-Tables-on-Trump-s-Willie-Horton-Style-Attacks-on-Kamala?pm_campaign=front_page&pm_source=trending&pm_medium=web

  content: 'RE: Covering daily rants: "Fox News" used to cover his events full coverage,
    since they started cutting away someone (on, I think it was MSNBC) wondered if
    their news network should start covering them, and let people hear.  I think those
    are probably more deserving of coverage , than the shouting into the void he has
    been doing on Twitter for over a dozen years. I did not think we think we should
    platform him then, when he said he teased he would shortly have an important announcement;
    and what was then revealed regarding the whole birth certificate thing did not
    seem like enough of a major announcement.  They do read his rants occasionly on
    Morning Joe on MSNBC . Who still watches network news, (aside from retired persons,
    some who may not even know there is an election), with CBS benching Nora O''Donnell,
    according to Katie Couric? I don''t know about local news. I''d be surprised if
    they showed him in context, changing the subject to tarrifs and inanity such as
    "Child care is child care ."  However CNN, and MSNBC devoted time to this & the
    "weave", the same week as the Harrisburg Town Hall on Hannity.'

    Carter; which he feels is the better way to deal with his crazy.

  content: <@188697047153508353> They have a contact us section on their official
    website, with a category listed as "feedback." I think for us as something we
    can do, we can send a message to them asking to keep their advertisement team
    ontop of ads such as this one, and how critical it was to Bush's victory back
    in the year 200. Al Gore was just 500 votes short of winning Florida, and his
    failure in this was likely due to ads like the one mentioned above.

  content: I haven't seen anything that saucy from the official Harris-Walz resources.
    Demcast is independent. And While it's not a great joke,  I think the joke is
    meant to make people feel seen rather than called out.

    to somebody who challenged me online and I did receive one citation for hate speech
    immediately after and I assure you I never use hate speech; and I once reposted
    a liberal creators content and received another warning for violation of content
    which I now think might have been a bot also. So there may be some truth to this
    and we should all be aware. We cannot afford to lose our online presence this
    close to the election. Please be careful!

    It''s not just you. Some of the more popular lives and progressive-leaning creators
    are being mass reported. For example, The Meidas Touch Network''s official TT
    page was just restored via community outreach and behind-the-scenes legal scuffling.


    The Good News: Should you receive a CGV, you can appeal and, more often than not,
    the content will be restored.


    The Meh News: Even the best of us might forget to use softer/alternate language
    for "adult" themes or subjects in the heat of the moment. Examples of alternative
    language can include: Unaliving, the skull emoji, the water gun emoji or pew-pew,
    self-deletion, pig latin, and/or smooshing syllables.


    Lastly, take heart! The candidate campaign has had at least 18-months to prepare
    for the run so it may seem overwhelming or more organized (SPOILER: They''re not);
    compare that with what we''ve cobbled together in a handful of weeks.


    We got this! We keep going.'

    there was a time he was a jovial, happy child. now he seems hollow, like a puppet

    down to what we see now, which is a man that struggles to connect to the world
    around him and fixates on what he knows -- an old 50's image of a 'traditional
    nuclear family' that doesn't really exist.

  content: How are we responding to Trump saying it is "CHEATING" to use podium steps/lifts?
    This obviously seems like an attempt by Trump to control a narrative that Kamala
    is a cheater so if they appear to be the same height from the outset of the debate
    his followers will already be engaged in a lie with him. This seems like an appropriate
    thing to call out and get ahead of. Is there any place to find the oofficial campaign
    messaging on this topic? I also cannot see it mentioned anywhere on the ABC website
    so I am assuming this was not an agreed upon rule.

  content: 'Hi CMoney!


    This is a good opportunity to ask some follow up questions and figure out what
    is important to the responder.


    For example: Ask them in what ways their life has been more difficult under the
    Biden/Harris administration. Don''t be afraid to ask them to get specific about
    policy.


    Sometimes, they''ll list off a bunch of things right off the bat (or try to steam
    roll you). Another technique is to ask them which is the most important or to
    take the points one at a time.


    From there, apply the ABCs (Acknowledge their concern, Bridge with facts, Connect
    with a story of your own).


    Lastly, you may find that folks are a little fuzzy on how our government works
    and what the VP is consitutionally empowered to do.


    Good Luck!'

  content: 'NGL: It can be exhausting having these conversations and witnessing the
    disconnect in (or near) real time. It can feel like a broken record or running
    on a treadmill (and not getting anywhere).


    More often than not, these are teachable moments to those who are reading along
    or watching silently in the background. If nothing else, the exchange provides
    a counter-example of a behavior no one wants.


    What helps me is to remember I am speaking to someone who is scared and when we''re
    scared, it''s really tough to take a beat and think things through.


    Depending upon who it is, I have had some success getting really granular and
    breadcrumbing those steps away from fear to something a little more balanced.


    It''s a dance between outreach and protecting your peace.


    I get by with frequent breaks and lots of snacks'

    a lot of shouting doesn''t really teach anyone anything, but being calm when someone

    but every once in a while you find someone who''s wanting to listen, but might
    be too afraid to ask. or might be politically illiterate (as is most people i''d
    imagine). i found my best success with those who had a specific concern/minority
    and addressing that to get them interested.'

  content: Hey, not to go all California hippie woo woo on everyone, but can I suggest
    that we all here try today to reflect and refract positive energy and put that
    out as what VP Harris has as the psychic force to counter the (yes exhausting)
    negging of the other side? Or you could call it a prayer if that's more your thing.
    But maybe just until the debate is over we could have conversations about joy
    and loving our country? From a physics perspective, you want to amplify a message
    by adding sound waves tovether. So we want her to have positive messages that
    she's amplifying to the rest of the country. We know who he is. Maybe they don't
    know who she is. We can talk about difficulty after the debate (I don't want to
    minimize reality). But for now, she can preach to the choir, we amplify her message.
    We can sing, she can amplify our voice. Maybe people could add a prayer or a joyous
    positive message?

  content: I definitely want to leave the floor open to other volunteers who I know
    are navigating similar conversations to share their tips and experiences, but
    I can offer a few thoughts! In general, keep in mind that our goal is to engage
    people who are unsure, need more information, or lean towards supporting Kamala
    and Democrats. It's okay to not engage here if you don't feel like the conversation
    will be productive. If you do choose to engage, I'd focus on sharing your personal
    reasons for supporting Kamala and emphasizing her dedication to moving our country
    forward -- opening up the opportunity for dialogue across international and domestic
    issues in a way that Trump has made clear will not happen if he's elected to a
    second term.

  content: This is something that I thought maybe I should talk to you guys about
    since we are the ones that are working a lot with getting information out there
    online. But has anybody ever notice how it seems that people don't have this damn
    about how a bill becomes law? Reason why I'm saying this is because if you notice
    during the debate when Trump said to Harris about going down the Washington and
    getting joe to sign a thing to shut the border and what not which theoretically
    he could do with an executive order people think that that's all it takes to solve
    anything it's just for the president to sign a piece of paper when we all know
    that a large majority of the time you can't do anything without Congress. I was
    thinking about this because I just finished the phone bank for about an outreach
    group that I'm on the board of and a lady brought up about how a lot of people
    don't realize that with a lot of these laws and a lot of these bills and whatnot
    it takes Congress to approve them before the president signs off on them.

  content: 'I don''t know any explicit messaging from the campaign on that, but he
    did have 4 years to pull out of Afghanistan and left it for Biden... and then
    used it as a political cudgel.


    Harris said something during the debate yesterday: "And as of today, there is
    not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat
    zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century."


    The fact that he lifted the Obama era restrictions on civilian casualties basically
    in every single case and almost started a hot war with Iran seem like good points
    to form a message around. Not sure how to form that beyond the mere facts. Data
    on additional civilian deaths I guess?


    This Vox article might be helpful for anyone interested in crafting a message.

    take a partial screenshot with the snip it tool than it is to download the photo

  content: 'Penzey''s Spices is a great place to buy spices in bulk and they have
    trial sizes if trying something new.


    Cooking is something I enjoy and I''ve been purchasing from them for years. Good
    quality. Fun recipes. Gift ideas for any holiday.


    This is also a reminder to me to order their cocoa and cider packs now that the
    weather is starting to turn.

  content: 'Hi Eric!


    I am sorry there are people in your comment sections being disingenuous and worse.


    My suggestion is to resubmit and to take a screenshot of the comment. Be sure
    to include the date(s) and time(s). Same goes for your initial report.


    Try resubmitting the report again with the screenshots.


    After taking the screenshots and resubmitting, delete the comment to protect your
    peace.


    While my personal preference is to keep such things/not to dirty delete, I understand
    that deleting and moving on is sometimes the better option in the long run.


    Good Luck!'

  content: Has everyone seen the song that I only saw today about taking our flag
    back by M R C H E E T O S? They have a YouTube channel full of great anti-MAGA
    songs. I can't figure out who's behind it and some posts say it's all AI. The
    titles and lyrics are all great - whether or not they're AI.

  content: I posted a meme in FB that I got from Pantsuit Nation that has gotten some
    good conversation going. It's about how tariffs are paid by the American consumer.
    Someone refuted that, because technically, yes, they are not directly paid by
    the American consumer, but then several people pointed out how small, private
    businesses may have the option to not raise prices on foreign goods, publicly
    traded ones don't ever use that option. **70% of people believe tariffs are paid
    by the foreign companies/countries.** That means there are Democrats out there
    who believe this. Let's get out some information on tariffs for the people who
    think his orangeness has better economic policy than Kamala.

  content: <@225877156247502850> Maybe this team could brainstorm some less work-intensive,
    quick online content campaigns around the economy that we could scale outward...and
    maybe we could apply lo-fi "game" tactics like quiz questions etc. Keep it simple,
    you know? A few campaign-endorsed key points we wanna really hammer home, a few
    key myths to debunk. I'd be totally up for joining an ideation session on this,
    if the team leads here think the general idea makes sense/is appropriate.

    and post them outside. Simple messages such as 'Choose Country' or "Choose Democracy".
    I need to have a strong link to the Harris-Walz campaign on the banners. i.e.
    Pictures of Kamela Harris and Tim Walz. The pictures need to be high resolution
    (the banners will be big) and with transparent background. I am sure the campaign
    media / graphic design office has material like that. Can anyone here connect

  content: It's mixed IMO. He says she "nailed it," but also undercuts that with comments
    about "the puppet master running the strings." He can't give her full credit for
    her accomplishments, can't bring himself to say that she, on her own, is a winner.
    But maybe this is the best we can ever hope for, from someone like him.

  content: Took a closer look and have drafted about a dozen social media messages
    focused on inflation stats and facts, including some that quote your blog post
    + link. Do you want to take a look? <@353287477601107988> could share the link
    to our G-Doc with you. As I think I noted in the news channel, we will also draft
    messaging on tax cuts, business climate, tariffs, and national debt. The idea
    is to have a ready-made place of copy-and-paste-able messaging folks can tweak
    and share. Would you be interested in helping with that?

  content: Trump's Health/science Record - Thanks much for the article links to Trump's
    record on reproductive health and healthcare generally. There are articles in
    professional journals I like to cite - they are rated as more objective/credible
    than media sources so that helps when posting community notes on twitter. Amazingly,
    two of the most prestigious journals are so scared about a possible Trump return
    that they have recently published editorials. Several journal articles in past
    few years give concrete evidence of Trump costing lives due to pandemic mismanagement
    - just one example here. Dr Francis Collins was just on msnbc saying number of
    lives lost needlessly was over 200,000 [clips available later]. His new book is
    'The Road to Wisdom --- how to combat disinformation.'  https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2024.307737

    jab at Harris for not having biological children, which is just the latest comment
    like that from MAGA leaders. These infuriate me. My son is not biologically mine,
    but it is the honor of my life to raise him on behalf of my friend who died in
    childbirth. Women and men who step up to be parents deserve respect and support,
    not insults. There are so many people like me who have welcomed children into
    their hearts and are working every day to raise them to be the best people possible.
    I would love to make that part of my outreach.

  content: 'In re: Energy & Fuel Prices


    I have found this site useful in terms of accurate data and visuals:

    https://www.eia.gov/


    Public misunderstandings of the energy markets I have encountered in the wild
    include:

    - Energy is a global market. Not all countries/continents have similar levels
    of resources and thus we trade.

    - Who/what OPEC is and how that affects crude oil pricing

    - Our refining capacity

    - That our country operates at an energy deficit and while we have made strides
    toward energy independence, we still have room to explore and grow

    - The transportation and supply demands during 2020-2021 and Trump''s 2-year OPEC+
    deal...

    - Which in turn had disastrous effects on small-to-midsize energy companies here

    - We continue to be the leading exporter of Liquid Nitrogen Gas (LNG); but fracking
    has negative impacts on the environment

    - Under Biden/Harris, we have more leases and are pumping more crude, but we lack
    the capacity to refine it

    - Once the pandemic was declared over, supply demands increased, but the OPEC+
    deal continues to keep the global supply low


    And Two pipelines: Keystone & Keystone XL

    - Keystone XL was a project by TransCanada Corp/TC Energy started in 2008

    - Keystone is still operating; Keystone XL was shelved in 2021 because it violated
    the Clean Water Act, didn''t meet NEPA requirements, and crossed tribal lands
    (remember the protests?)

    - Tar sands/tar sand oil is dirtier and more difficult to refine than crude'

    do  that before posing such questions. Turns out that questions like that can

    fact-checking, which I use a lot  on  twitter. take care, Dan

  content: On this point, using the state and congress levers might be an option.
    State govts have a lot of influence upward on the federal govt (look at where
    we are right now with secs of state, election process, etc.). And as skadreamer
    notes, the congress counts for a lot.

    because it was a bit off-point so I''ll repeat my original comment here: I know
    friends who vote mainly because of the judiciary -- they don''t want to see extremist,
    right-wing judges installed. To add to that: a lot of our rights are caught up
    and getting trashed in the courts. We all know about SCOTUS, but some of the circuits
    (especially 5th, TX/MS/LA) are being used by folks like "Leon" Musk to judge-shop
    and get their way.'

    the VP, not the P. And she's part of a team she didn't pick. But people act otherwise.
    Biden has been strongly pro-Israel for decades, regardless of the details (their
    govt, etc.). She cannot undermine him, especially now. I wish people were more
    understanding of this.

  content: It is a very complicated topic with no simple solution. Combine that with
    how personal people feel about it, makes it a landmine either way. Not a fun place

  content: The logic that people should realize is that Palestinians tend to support
    a two-state solution, Kamala supports the option that is most popular to Palestinians.
    Our choices, as far as Palestine goes, are two State solution, where Palestine
    gets their sovereignty but Israel also is allowed to continue to exist, or one
    state solution where Israel completely annexes Palestine because Donald Trump
    gives them the green light. People argue Non-Stop that a Harris presidency would
    be just as bad for Palestine as a trump presidency, those people do not understand
    what they are talking about at all.

    things that they can do something about since black women have the least access

  content: I disagree, I think in terms of left-wing third parties in the US, the
    green party is not a good option because they are single-issue in nature. At this
    point in US Politics, third parties are basically just activist groups (with the
    exception of the Libertarians) and as activist groups go, CPUSA and DSA are way
    better than greens because they are anti-Russia and anticapitalist as well as
    being pro-environment. Of course, I say this as a socialist so I fully understand
    if liberals here disagree with that but I think that my perspective as a socialist
    is relevant in the discussion of left-wing third parties

    charge for their goods. which is why despite the economy "getting better" and
    companies are making more money, we''re still paying more."


    it''s an extremely crude explanation and not 100% accurate or detailed but it''s
    enough for the average person to understand.'

  content: 'Hi Claudia:


    What I have discovered out here in these Social Media Streets is folks are misinformed
    about the difference between an asylum seeker, a refugee, migrant workers/day
    laborers, and folks whose visas have expired. Some of these people have documents,
    some don''t, and some are in the process of completing their immigration.


    Asylum is a legal process and I would encourage you to look up 8 USC 1158--and
    have that handy.

    (Once someone sets foot on US soil, they can claim asylum. You don''t have to
    go through a port of entry.)


    The percentage of asylum seekers who are granted asylum in the U.S. varies depending
    on the specific time frame and the type of asylum case. Here are the key points:


    - Overall Grant Rate: Historically, about 30-40% of asylum seekers who go through
    the U.S. immigration system are granted asylum. This includes both affirmative
    cases (where the seeker is not in removal proceedings) and defensive cases (where
    asylum is sought as a defense against deportation)

    - Recent Trends: In recent years, the grant rate has fluctuated. For example,
    in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, around 46% of asylum seekers were granted asylum. Defensive
    asylum cases, which make up a larger portion of total cases, typically see a slightly
    lower grant rate, closer to 39%.

    - Comparison to Total Applications: While about 70% of asylum seekers may initially
    pass the "credible fear" screening, which allows them to stay in the U.S. while
    their case is processed, only about 20-30% ultimately qualify for asylum through
    the full legal process.


    These numbers highlight the challenges faced by asylum seekers in navigating the
    U.S. immigration system, where a significant portion of applicants are ultimately
    not granted asylum despite being allowed to stay in the country temporarily during
    the process.'

    There was a bill which passed the CA state house, which would have allowed qualified
    people to have home loans, but our governor killed the bill at the start of this
    month.

    In some states/counties/cities, undocumented people are allowed to vote in those
    elections, which makes sense because they are living/working/paying taxes there
    and should have a say about what affects them day to day.'

  content: 'In re: "Open Borders! Trump Closed It!"

    1) We are and have been under 8 USC for 60 years and that included during Trump''s
    term.


    2) In 2020, Trump had the power under Title 42 to declare a public health emergency.
    Biden wanted to extend it in anticipation of the processing backlog, but SCOTUS
    ruled the request unconstitutional since the pandemic was over.


    3) The comprehensive border bill authored by R-Langford was shot down in the house
    because Trump wanted to run on it. Harris wants that bill back on the floor and
    has stated she will sign it.'

    other than that, as long as you have it somewhere clear on the profile that you''re
    not actually affiliated with her campaign as an official staffer, i think all
    is good!'

  content: not a problem! it's been a while since i did anything like that for tumblr.
    and it's understandable, i'm only recalling that when i saw the drone show they

    (it's just my family and friends and by now we all know where we stand), but I
    used the idea from here and posted this morning "What is the first presidential
    election about which you have even the faintest memory? What was the first presidential
    election you voted in?" and I am getting some dialogues going! Thanks for the
    ideas here! Election or not, it is nice to see something more than likes to my
    posts.

  content: The general advice is to block trolls and negative posters and not try
    to engage with them. You might encourage the person who posted the video to block
    trolls. Interacting with them boosts their numbers and invites more of them.

  content: "Key Research Findings on Immigration & Crime - I will try to find a place\
    \ to post a version with citations. I'll also summarize refutations to specific\
    \ attacks on Kamala regarding immigration.\n\u2022    Many studies conducted over\
    \ the past 150 years are quite consistent: Contrary to popular belief, both authorized\
    \ and unauthorized immigrants have crime rates equal to or lower than those born\
    \ in the U.S. \n\u2022    Some studies focus on homicides. Immigrants, whether\
    \ authorized or unauthorized, have lower homicide rates than people born in the\
    \ U.S. \n\u2022    In a study of all 50 states, increased unauthorized immigration\
    \ over 14 years was not related to terrorist attacks, radicalization, or terrorism\
    \ prosecutions. \n\u2022    \u201CSanctuary communities\u201D are as safe as other\
    \ communities. They are likely to decrease crime because immigrant victims are\
    \ much more willing to call the police. \n\u2022    Although there is no connection\
    \ between crime and unauthorized immigration, the media almost always depicts\
    \ immigrants as criminals. \n\u2022    Despite calls to close \u201Copen borders,\u201D\
    \ the U.S. has not had open borders since the 1920s.  Reports indicate that the\
    \ border is well fortified.\n\u2022    Policies during the Trump administration\
    \ led to long-lasting trauma for children separated from their parents.  The Trump\
    \ administration\u2019s \u201Creturn to Mexico policy\u201D forced asylum-seekers\
    \ back to Mexico to await their hearings. That placed them in extreme danger.\
    \ At least one in 70 people forced to return reported being victims of rape, kidnapping,\
    \ assault, and other crimes in Mexico.\n\u2022    Policy-makers can help prevent\
    \ homicides by immigrants by supporting social service and law enforcement practices\
    \ that welcome immigrants. These homicides will not be prevented through deportations,\
    \ further criminalizing immigrants or banning sanctuary communities. Research\
    \ studies do nothing to comfort the loved ones of those brutally murdered, but\
    \ they can be used to create policies that will help keep everyone safe."

  content: 'Hi Ray!


    If it is any consolation, I am hearing similar arguments from adults and I suspect
    younger voters/interested youth may be repeating what they hear at home.


    On the one hand: We had the pandemic which caused global inflation and supply/consumer
    goods shortages, and had many schools and parents/guardians learning and working
    remotely.


    On the other hand: Biden & Harris worked with congress to pass the American Rescue
    Plan (which put a little more money into our pockets), the Inflation Reduction
    Act, the bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS and sciences act (which
    is bringing manufacturing back and creating more jobs). Of the G7, our economic
    recovery was the fastest.


    From here, ask each other questions and encourage their media literacy learning
    (which may coincide with How to Cite Your Sources lessons in school).


    Good Luck!'

  content: Your best rule of thumb is to either find a free source with the same info
    or if you have a subscription, you can do a "Gift" link which means that whomever
    has that link will be able to view it without the worry of a paywall. Just a tip
    from someone who has done this for years. Also one of my friends in Hawaii does
    the "Gift" link a lot when he wants to share articles that he has access to but
    others might not.

    \ I notice they don't include any video of her saying this.  If she had been repeating\

  content: 'Only one problem with the screenshot thing: Unless you use alt text (ie
    a description of what the photo says), it will prevent some from seeing it as
    they have vision issues and some devices those visually impared people use don''t
    always show photos/graphics that well. This is why a lot of people when posting
    graphics will either post a descriptive text with them or will inculde a short
    summary that will help the VI person with getting an idea of what is being shown.
    Learned that from a college friend who is legally blind.'

  content: I've also watched nearly all of her speeches and do not recall her ever
    saying anything like that, either. Not even close. Weinstein is part of the Thiel/Musk/etc.
    axis of VC-vil. Those guys and their candidates have already shown that they're
    willing to make up stuff out of thin air.

  content: Hi Ray - re Economy TikTok -- Seems comprehensive and good charts. I don't
    repost anything that uses the F word. Seems very long -- I bet there are better
    ones. Also citing stats on the good economy won't reach people unless they first
    hear empathy about the pain they feel. Kamala does this well e,g, NC speech on
    the economy where she first acknowledges  gas and grocerry prices are to high
    and then pivots to how she'll fix that with concrete plans

  content: 100%. <@1082643965167288360> , one strategy I've seen suggested by others
    many times in these cases is to ask questions seeking to understand *why* they
    think the way they do. And from there you can unearth contradictions, gaps, assumptions.
    I've tried it myself with good results.

    a recent example) that plagues MAGA (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/opinion/mark-robinson-maga-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Mk4.gBT8.lyx9t_6pK9T5&smid=url-share)'

  content: I've tried Canva which works pretty well. Also, if your computer has a
    video editor already installed (like iMovie or Clipchamp), don't underestimate
    them. I used iMovie to edit video for YouTube for years. I'm actually wanting
    to learn how to use Clipchamp since I bought a PC recently but I think I need
    to upgrade the laptop slightly since I don't have that big of a hard drive and
    the memory isn't that much.

  content: 'I had a friend in high school who always had something like this at her
    house. Theirs was cucumbers with tomatoes and a vinegarette and the crazy part
    is the only one in the house that really ate it was her dad and when I was over
    there, he always split it with me because he knew I liked it.


    Also one of my favorite go-tos was always this pasta dish my sister used to make
    where she took any kind of pasta and combined it with olive oil, a little garlic
    and Italian herbs, and a lot of cheese. I still make it from time to time since
    it reminds me so much of my sister (she passed away four years ago).'

    about NAFTA. Perot was like a visitor from the future.

    Sadly, no one listened to me because I still remember arguing so much with my

  content: <@941196169852366859> , you're a whippersnapper -- my first was Carter
    v. Reagan in 1980.  _wry_ I've survived a lot of bad presidents, but djt scares
    me. Kamala isn't perfect -- nobody is!! -- but she's pretty damned good and I'm
    ecstatic she's a candidate!

  content: Here are my thoughts and I could be dead wrong. Harris is part of an administration
    right now and doesn't set foreign policy. I personally believe her approach will
    be different than Biden's. Her words have been nuanced and she has said she supports
    Israel's right to defend itself. I think she is holding back for the sake of continuity
    and because it's her role as VP. I know this doesn't really help but, she's a
    woman of color, she's a moderate progressive.

  content: I also think it's critically important we elect a democratic Senate and
    House. Harris could be The Perfect Candidate, but -- despite djt's delusions!
    -- the president is not a dictator. She's got to have support from Congress to
    make the changes we all hope for happen.

    all we have to do is get them out to the polls to vote for her.

  content: I turned 18 in 1985. I don't think I voted in 88. In either 1992 or 1996
    I protest voted for Ross Perot because I did not like Tipper Gore, Al Gore's wife.
    I just knew that Tipper. meddled in music and I did not like her parenting me.
    Also, I didn't have a television and information wasn't as easy to come by as
    it is now. I finally started paying more attention and voted for Kerry in 2004
    and then Obama in 2008 and 2012. Voting became extremely important in 2016 when
    I voted for Clinton. Even moreso in 2020 when I voted for Biden. I guess I had
    a rough start but I feel like this is the most important election of my life.

    following...at least in South Jersey. I also know a few people who have worked
    on his campaign and they have told me how well received he is there.  PA has a

    those signs for McCormick, I get nervous.

  content: 'I would love some advice on how to find possibly undecided voters or potentially
    persuadable Trumpy voters on Threads and X. My algorithms are feeding me all blue
    voters for the most part. X is filled with so many trolls in the comments of any
    posts from right-wing news accounts that it''s hard to know where to bother engaging.
    Do we have any data on the value of engaging on X at all?


    That said, I''ve had some good conversations with a couple of blue voters who
    were posting cynical takes. I point out the need for encouraging engagement through
    positivity and a spirit of unity. I''ve also been wearing down a couple of intelligent
    evangelical friends on FB who don''t like Trump but have been lied to about Kamala.
    It''s amazing how effective one can be when acknowledging people''s concerns rather
    than judging and arguing!


    Sincerely pro-life people are worried about the "unintended consequences" of the
    harsher abortion restrictions, and it''s easy to change people''s minds about
    economics if they''re not completely absorbed into the cult.'

  content: Yes, I've been through both parts. They didn't go into much detail about
    how to target engagement if most of your relationships and group affiliations
    are already pretty liberal. I feel like I'm good at these conversations and just
    need to get better at zeroing in on best opportunities.

    with the colors that we can use. I wish that they would upload meme content on
    Reach. I make memes the campaign which has to go through an officia review process
    which are separate than ones that I  make for the meme channel but the are in
    the supporter content channel but not in Reach.

    and i started tracking how many clicks the links in our sub get so i can better
    gauge the effectiveness of our automod messages and stuff like that. For just
    the US IP addresses we have about 200 clicks for the last 2 weeks for links on
    how to register, vote reminders, volunteering for the Harris campaign and donating
    to various efforts as well as donating to a food bank in Springfield Ohio. Obviously
    not all of those clicks equal a a new voter, volunteer or a donation but i am
    sure some do.

  content: I wanted to share this with you all since I think a few of you may have
    requested a community note on X/Twitter regarding this. There was a post going
    around saying that Harris used a teleprompter during the Oprah interview. I put
    a comment saying, "Teleprompters are often used in video production and they're
    usually to keep things running smooth for the host in situations where guests
    are 'ad-libbing' their answers." Seems today I found this in my notifications

    of classes in video/TV production and digtal media. Of course it wasn't anything
    like it is today when I was at Rider, that's for sure.

  content: "For replying to news & social media about Kamala in AZ today...\n\nHOW\
    \ BIDEN & HARRIS HAVE FOUGHT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\nCALIFORNIA. As California\
    \ AG, Kamala Harris went after drug gangs, human traffickers and cartels that\
    \ smuggled guns, drugs, and human beings across the US-Mexico border.\n\nCENTRAL\
    \ AMERICA ROOT CUASES. In 2021, VP Harris led the effort to address root causes\
    \ of illegal immigration to the US from Central America, negotiating $4B in direct\
    \ assistance and over $5.2B in US private-public investment. With economic recovery\
    \ 2022-23, encounters at the Southern border from all countries increased, but\
    \ the share of encounters from Mexico & Central America decreased by 30% points.\n\
    \nBIPARTISAN BILL KILLED BY TRUMP. In Feb 2024, Trump urged Republicans to REJECT\
    \ the bipartisan immigration bill that included permanent restrictions on asylum\
    \ while significantly increasing border agents, asylum adjudicators and immigration\
    \ judges. The bipartisan bill (supported by ~20 Rep Senators) was DEMANDED and\
    \ NEGOTIATED by Republicans who tied the bill to a Ukraine aid package, but Trump\
    \ killed the deal for his own political gain.\n\nBIDEN-HARRIS ASYLUM RESTRICTIONS.\
    \ Between Feb and Jun 2024, the Biden-Harris administration developed and executed\
    \ a plan for DHS and DOJ to suspend the entry of most migrants crossing the US-Mexico\
    \ border illegally, virtually shutting down asylum processing. The Biden-Harris\
    \ plan differs from Trump\u2019s plan by providing exemptions for humanitarian\
    \ reasons such as victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those\
    \ with severe medical emergencies.The result was ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS FELL\
    \ TO A 4-YEAR LOW. More recently, Biden has secured additional funding for the\
    \ most significant increase in border agents in ten years. \n\nCOMPREHENSIVE REFORM.\
    \ As President, Harris will bring back the bipartisan bill and sign it into law.\
    \ And she will push for  comprehensive reform that includes strong border security\
    \ and an earned pathway to citizenship."

  content: I need some advice to help my 74-year-old housemate. Her friend from the
    1970s seems to be only aware of information from Fox News. They haven't seen each
    other since the 1990s. My housemate thinks her friend is intelligent, and they
    both used to work for the NSA. It's difficult for my housemate to have open conversations
    with her friend. Do you have any advice for dealing with this kind of situation?
    She is worried her friend is a Trumper and is trying to talk to her. She seems
    upset her friend has changed. I think being of service has some to do with it,
    too.

    Border Czar\u201D, she was assigned to work with 3 Central American countries,\
    \ El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, to reduce the underlying causes of migration\
    \ to the U.S.  She built on her experience as a DA and Attorney General in California,\
    \ where she worked closely with CA police & prosecutors & their Mexican counterparts\
    \ to bring drug smugglers & human traffickers to justice.\nMigrants make the tough\
    \ choice to leave their homes & homeland to make the arduous & dangerous journey\
    \ to the U.S. in order to escape extreme poverty, gang violence & corruption.\
    \ \nShe helped send more $4 billion in U.S. aid to those countries, including\
    \ COVID vaccines. She obtained the involvement of over 50 companies that have\
    \ invested $5.2 billion & created more than 70,000 jobs. Columbia Sportswear,\
    \ Nespresso, auto-parts manufacturer Yazaki North America Inc., & others created\
    \ thousands of factory & farming jobs.\nHer efforts were stymied by entrenched\
    \ gang violence & corruption. Nonetheless, migration from the 3 countries during\

    \ it was in 2019 under Trump. While encouraging, it\u2019s hard to know if her\

  content: 'Are we sending any volunteers to engage on Reddit?  It seems like a largely
    untapped social media platform for us, and it''s a goldmine.  It''s largely already
    liberal, so we can focus on getting out the vote, recruiting volunteers, and getting
    donations.  Even better, it''s easy to target people.  For example, in the Georgia
    subreddit we can reach out to people in Georgia and make sure they know the deadline
    for registering to vote is coming up.  I''ve already had some success getting
    hundreds of likes and comments on some posts, some in subreddits that are probably
    low engagement voters or non-voters.  Since most people are not going to like
    or comment, that means many times more are viewing these.


    Most of the comments on Reddit today are liberal but not helpful.  We should be
    providing actionable information, especially in local subreddits.  Links to information
    about voting, registration, etc.  We should jump in when anyone makes a complaint
    about Trump and provide information for people to do something about it!  I''m
    already doing this as much as I can, but the more people we get involved, especially
    in local subreddits (every city has one), the better.  I can''t cover all the
    small subreddits.'

  content: I loved when she did the interview with Oprah because of the way she responded
    to that bombshell that she's a gun owner. As someone who is a Democrat and can
    legally carry in PA, I love when you see someone on our side say about that because
    it chips away at that stereotype that all we want to do is take away all guns
    when we just want sensible laws like we had in the 90s under Clinton.

  content: Favorite moment of the campaign so far? I have watched many political conventions,
    way before I was deemed old enough to vote... Her acceptance speech of the nomination
    <:YES:1252806140081737780>  However, I did enjoy watching her perform well at
    the debate, as she finally had an opportunity to explain policy to those of us
    who aren't involved in the campaigns or watch 24/7 cable news.  VP Harris exposed
    that Trump had no replacement, if the Republican party repealed well, you know.

  content: I have been posting the Reach content a lot! I notice I am getting more
    followers and engagement, but finally today, I got both a quote tweet, and a comment.
    Both positive . Thank you to whomever it is who diligently gets so much content
    in the Reach app and very timely! By the election, I might be having a relatively
    interactive social media experience instead of just sending things into the void.
    I dp have some loyal followers who retweet my tweets fairly regularly, so I like
    that since it gets the Harris/Walz reach content out in front of ever more viewers.
    Anyway, just kudos to the reach content creators!

  content: 'My only suggestion here is to reach out to Meta and ask them to be specific
    with regard to what they need to get your account(s) across the platform reinstated
    anyway.


    I also suspect that while you may have been removed from the groups, those that
    you have created and which meet a membership threshold will still be there.


    If worse comes to worse and Meta won''t restore access (even after asking nicely),
    you may need to create a new set of accounts and ask group members/friends to
    approve your rejoining.'

  content: I don't think it matters what Trump says anymore,  I think the people who
    are voting Harris  will and KNOW He's Dangerous and the Trump voters are already
    ready to vote for him. I think  the best we could do is make sure the undecided
    voters know as much about Harris  as possible.  People  need  to understand  her
    stance on  foreign affairs , the middle east is a hot bed for fear of 3rd WW,
    the economy ( she's done that) but needs to message  more in interviews,  and
    immigration policy  talk about  it more. I don't think  we should keep  advertising  for
    Trump. We don't  need people  thinking he's a Tough guy, foe some reason the US
    is in love with them. I think Harris  should talk about  Relief and sustainable  living
    for the victims of all States devastated by Helene.

    ranting about childless women who pursue careers and "punishing" childless people.
    There are two such posts since the weekend. You might do same, to reach more apathetic
    women or undecideds. Coincidentally, Russia is considering legislation to ban
    "childfree ideology." JD Vance belongs in the Kremlin, not the White House.

  content: as a person who has learning differences, he's a real POS. and as I like
    to refer to him as, King of Projection. He's calling her that because ppl can
    tell HE, HIMSELF, has some kind of cognitive decline occurring, along with his
    horrible personality & damgeous ideas. HE & GOP PROJECT EVERYTHING THEY ARE &
    ARE DOING so sick! he made fun of a reporter with disabilities too.

  content: Infiltration isn't a great idea at this stage of the game if you don't
    already have sock puppets embedded their mod teams will sniff you out. And they
    all communicate with each other so if your account gets burned (for instance if
    they check mutual servers and see your main is here) then you'll lose access to
    all the servers you've gotten verified patriot status to that point will be for
    nothing.

  content: What struck me in particular was the prevalence of neurodivergence in the
    alt right. Lends itself to online chat rooms without social anxiety and the high
    IQs lead to superiority complex which when we collectively ignore the needs of
    the american people in favor of lower taxes leads to a sense of unfairness.  And
    so we see how small govt gop morphed into maga into maga communism. They're begging
    for populism to redistribute wealth to the middle class.

  content: The wild bit of this I found interesting is that Trump would like to serve
    as head of state and let JD act as PM making policy decisions which the big guy
    doesn't actually ideologically care about. He might really have a hard time understanding
    the perspective of the youths is why he makes such frequent gaffs and seemingly
    can't decide how he feels about things until he takes the pulse online or through
    polls then decides what to do

  content: Hey, you never know. This person puts themselves out as an expert on a
    particular topic and does have a related business, but yeah! My hunch is that
    they're just one of these "burn it all down" contrarians from the left side of
    the spectrum, who likes to feel like a rebel.

  content: I have consistently maintained that an individual's character is their
    most vital attribute. Character serves as a reflection of one's true nature and
    inner essence. When we support individuals who demonstrably contravene the principles
    and values embodied by character, it necessitates introspection and self-reflection.
    Character-driven individuals exhibit compassion, honesty, fairness, self-discipline,
    sound judgment, respect for others, courage in upholding convictions, a strong
    sense of responsibility, civic-mindedness, and self-awareness.

  content: Absolutely look into it with FB; push through the FB support options until
    you get what you think is a clear answer (when you know why and are happy with
    your next steps). There are too many reasons why this and related account/content
    issues cause problems. Their filters and AI-powered evaluations can't not make
    assumptions. There is nuance. I just had the "pleasure" of reactivating a half
    dozen or so accounts and apps for my next steps in here. FB banned me from posting
    b/c I hadn't posted in a long.  X sent me through a labyrinth of validations for
    pretty much the same reason. Persevere and Google!

  content: 'Short Answer: Yes


    Longer Answer: Progressive Social Media Influencers and Content Creators have
    experienced an increase in time outs and account bans this election season; these
    are increasing as we approach Early Voting and Election Day proper.


    What we can do is keep going. By this I mean, keep on doing what we are doing;
    posting content from Reach, focusing our (re)posts in coordination with HQ, requesting
    CNs to correct mis/disinformation, and working within our spheres of influence
    to spread the message--and the hope and joy.


    I expect the increase in account reporting to continue, so be prepared and do
    what you can to protect your peace.'

    \ our best strategy is to have authentic conversations with people in our digital\

    \ right is that you have a greater impact to energy expended ratio talking to\

    \ plan to vote, than trying to convince hardcore Trump supporters. At the end\
    \ of the day though, we know every single vote counts and that's why it's crucial\
    \ that we all do what we can to fight and win this <:blueheart:1252803082849488956>\
    \  \n\nI wouldn't recommend intentionally going into MAGA-heavy spaces to try\
    \ to convince voters, because you're not going to get as much \"bang for your\
    \ buck\" there. It's also harder to keep up the momentum of joy in those spaces,\
    \ and we know that's a big part of why this campaign is resonating with so many\
    \ -- because it focuses on joy and the future! If you're interested intentional\

  content: I'm doing work in campaign social. I've decided to post on Twitter (won't
    call it the other name) and have gone into "magaland" and posted memes that show
    the difference between VP Kamala's plans and "project 2025". The reason I'm writing
    this is to let you know the resistance is STRONG on twitter and the magas aren't
    getting a lot of reposting. I take it as a good sign.

  content: "I'm sorry that I couldn't share this in time for the VP debate because\
    \ Pete missed something. The psychologists missed it too. Yes, JD has sociopathic\
    \ traits; yes, he wants power, but that's not the whole story. He has a reason.\
    \ I've met someone like him before.\n\nJD has always been a systemic thinker.\
    \ That's why he had a problem with Trump in the first place. There is a popular\
    \ idea in higher education ethics that promotes calculated risks and meaningful\
    \ sacrifices. This is the same thinking that drives doctors not to treat miscarrying\
    \ women - because *they can save more lives by not getting arrested.* \n\nI think\
    \ JD behaves in an inhuman way **by choice**, to serve a specific goal. I think\
    \ he removes his own basic human compassion for the US population as a \"necessary\
    \ evil,\" in his head, at least. He believes he is the good guy protagonist on\
    \ a crusade against evil, and I think Trump was only ever a pawn to him.\n\nI\
    \ heard him say in an interview (I wish I could remember where) that he thinks\
    \ the world will become more compassionate if more people have children. I think\
    \ he meant it. This is his own internal narrative, and he wants others to have\
    \ the same profound experience because he believes people ONLY learn true compassion\
    \ when they have kids. I think his plan is to put himself in power and force as\
    \ many births as possible through legislation. I think he genuinely believes that\
    \ this will promote peace and security for the future of all mankind.\n\nIs he\
    \ wrong? OF COURSE HE IS. People learn compassion in early childhood, not in the\
    \ moment they reproduce. That's why its so easy for him to ignore the needs of\
    \ a nation to serve his good-guy-protagonist agenda. His mother couldn't give\
    \ him the compassion he needed when he was young.\n\nThis is his *reason* for\
    \ wanting power, his psychological Achilles' heel. The more he is confronted with\
    \ the reality of childless compassion, the more it will destabilize him."

  content: I agree with one small difference. It not his personal idea. He's representing
    the online communities trump has tried to piggy back off of. That's why he was
    chosen as the true ideological heir apparent when it was biden harris they thought
    it wouldn't matter that much to choose the sincere successor.

    Reach has away to add them to the app depending on whether they need to register
    or are already registered. https://www.reach.vote/knowledge-base/adding-people/
    if you can tell me more about what the form for inquiries is I might be able to
    help you find that too.

    Not sure where to post this, so let me know if this isn''t the place. Just saw
    several tweets about this story and wonder if we have a "rapid-response" from
    the campaign when this kind of thing comes up. It''s gathering steam on twitter...

  content: Hi, I do not have the rapid response message, but the GOP is playing its
    dirty trick. The presidents of the three universities do not admit any wrongdoing,
    and there is no criminal investigation. In addition, the mobile phone numbers
    of college students are available from the student clubs and organizations. If
    the student club leaders were Democrats supporters, they might submit the mobile
    phone numbers of their club members to the local Democrats office.

    In re: Rapid Response

    We do have a channel managed by the campaign and party and when they want us to
    take immediate action and/or help them capture a moment, they will push any instructions
    to us via the <#1250551973053468672>  channel.


    From reading the article, it looks like the campaign is aware of the issue and
    it seems that certain information about students is a matter of public record
    in that state.'

  content: Let's not get complacient though. I'm dead serious here, people! DON'T
    GET COMPLACIENT! We made that mistake in 2016 when the polls got this good and
    that's how we got into this mess! So with that said, keep the course and keep
    working to make these poll results translate into actual votes!

  content: 'TRUMP COMMUNICATED WITH PUTIN AFTER LEAVING OFFICE


    - In 2016, Trump''s campaign manager shared swing state polling data with Russian
    intelligence operative Kilimnik.

    - In Helsinki in 2018, Trump publicly sided with Putin instead of US Intelligence
    experts.

    - When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Trump described Putin as "very savvy" and
    a "genius".

    - Since leaving office, Trump sought to undermine US foreign policy toward Russia
    with at least seven secret communications with Putin while urging Congress to
    block military aid to Ukraine.

    - How can any American patriot vote for Russian agent Donald J. Trump?????

    \ out to undecided voters. While wandering around the city looking for Democrats\
    \ stuff, I bumped onto someone. When I asked them for directions for the Democrats,\
    \ they told me they are voting for Trump. I asked why and they told me their reasons:\
    \ 1. Trump will be more effective at dealing with bad faith actors on the global\
    \ stage like Iran. 2. Kamala Harris' economic policies will turn the US into Communist\
    \ China and the people that will suffer the most will be the middle-class. I think\
    \ hearing such things even if we have strong feelings about them is  important.\
    \ Because it shows that there are other reasons people will vote for the other\
    \ side or simply one reason. So, the thing to ponder here is how can we persuade\
    \ people regarding points 1. and 2. as to why Harris is the better option. \U0001F642"

  content: This is what I do on TikTok--I wait a few minutes before posting again
    (posting what I created to other sites in the meantime). I also made sure I blocked
    anyone who said crappy things about Kamala. If they are just reporting you without
    saying anything there's not a lot you can do. I've also found TikTok doesn't seem
    to like certain videos--for quality purposes. So I use pictures and make videos
    from that.

  content: Right. But there is without a doubt that China is linked to communism aka
    very bad, and some people out there clearly believe Harris is a Marxist like a
    Red Scare 2.0 moment or someone even said she could be a Castro 2.0. Misinformation
    is part of the issue, and facts/figures helps for sure. But it is a talking point
    I have noticed on online forums.

  content: 'Hey Jorge!


    I have been seeing similar on TikTok/on the Lives of progressive TikTok content
    creators for several weeks at this point.


    The Good News: This can be redirected fairly quickly by asking the person to define
    Communism/Marxism, followed by asking them if they own their own home/property.
    A step further is to ask them what type of economy we have (spoiler: a mixed one.)


    The Meh News: The person responding may have a negative reaction when responding
    so do what you can to protect your peace.'

    and that she won't do much in the next 4 years?

  content: 'Some key points, if I may?

    - "Border Czar" is not an official title of any government official; it is one
    coined by MSM

    - DHS is in charge of the border. It''s chief is Mayorkas

    - The duties of a VP are defined in Articles 1 & 2 of our Constitution; President
    of the Senate, a tie breaking vote there, and someone to take over for the President
    and/or extra duties as assigned

    - We have been under Title 8 (8 USC) for 60 years

    - Asylum is a legal process and covered under 8 USC 1158 (spoiler: no port of
    entry required)

    - During C19 and under the public health emergency, we were under Title 42 which
    restricted immigration. Once the emergency was declared over, we went back to
    Title 8

    - Harris brokered a deal with the Northern Triangle Countries to further economic
    growth in that region and to stem the tide of immigration (root causes strategy)'

    I've been lucky on twitter as well. Only a few but then they block me. Elon Musk
    liked a post of mine when I said something about them being insane--(before I
    started with DNC) and then I messaged him and told him I meant that for the maga
    crowd....He's certainly suppressed my account, but not banned me. I have reported
    hateful comments and Tiktok removed them. I'm sorry you are getting hate mail--it's
    really unnerving!

    \ Brigade, XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade, 82nd Airborne\
    \ Division left Fort Liberty on Oct. 3 for Asheville, the largest city in western\
    \ North Carolina and part of Buncombe County, one of the most damaged parts of\
    \ the country by Helene. They are conducting inspections of the roads in the region,\
    \ as well as clearing debris and transporting supplies. Several aircraft were\
    \ deployed with them for the mission. \nMore than 500 soldiers with the 101st\
    \ Airborne Division deployed to western North Carolina on Saturday, Oct. 5. They\
    \ brought at least 60 Infantry Squad Vehicles, and more than 15 helicopters to\
    \ the area as well, for troop transport and to move supplies. The soldiers with\
    \ Task Force Falcon will be focused on a variety of roles, including search and\
    \ rescue, traffic control and clearing roads of debris. The active-duty troops\
    \ will also prioritize the last step of getting aid to communities, transporting\
    \ it from staging areas to \u201Cthe point of need,\u201D according to the Department\
    \ of Defense. \nHelene made landfall on Sept. 26 as a Category 4 hurricane and\
    \ in the days that followed tore through the southeast, flooding communities,\

  content: "A message from a FL Dem via online engagement (note the last lines): \
    \ I live in Gulfport, FL. My husband and I evacuated to the nearest shelter after\
    \ our flight out was canceled. TPA announced  their closing on Monday. They closed\
    \ at 9:00 am on Tuesday and our flight was booked for 8:55 am. By the time we\
    \ learned that our flight was canceled, everything else was booked so we were\
    \ stranded. No rental cars are available as many cars had been damaged by Helene\
    \ and rentals were taken. The evacuation shelter is grossly overcrowded, inefficiently\
    \ staffed and dirty. If we survive the storm, we will probably get sick. \nA note:\
    \ please advise the campaigns to stop asking for donations now. It's a very serious\
    \ situation here and we don't want to waste our very limited phone power on them."

  content: This is just personal and, of course, I will follow the guidelines of the
    team, but I thought it was brave and possibly true. She and Joe had/have a real
    relationship. You could see at the convention how they felt. Loyalty can sometimes
    be misplaced, but in this case I admire her for that answer. She went on to say
    how she might do things differently as President. The three and a half years of
    their administration has produced some amazing accomplishments. Are there issues
    the other side will try and use to beat her? Yep. But it's our response that will
    affect our supporters.

    to continue sharing her proposed policies and the stark contrast between how a
    Harris-Walz presidency will benefit the people vs. how a Trump-Vance presidency
    would be disastrous for every single community except the top 5%. The goal is
    to not let our online communities get distracted by a few comments on an interview

  content: 'Hi Donna!


    Thank you for the heads up about the rally on Oct. 27 and it appears other news
    outlets are reporting on it also.


    I think this post and its associated media would be better placed in the <#1268690577960992878>
    channel.


    Otherwise, how does this content uplift the policies and messages of the campaign?
    Does this content help support both the campaign and its volunteers?'

  content: '<@1276367808778862624> It is safe to say that those of us who are volunteering
    are doing so because we are aware of the history, have gone through that checklist,
    and are heeding the warning.


    We *are* doing something. I also think it is safe to say the campaign, party,
    and current administration is also aware of and heeding the warning.


    I realize that it is rough for many on multiple fronts and thus, it can seem/be
    overwhelming. That may be by design. But I know that it is often the little things/gestures
    which shine brightest during tougher times.


    What small thing can you do to channel that discomfort and worry into action?'

  content: I volunteer with a national non-profit and they have a media kit that one
    can draw from to use in the profile or banners for different social media platforms
    - already cut to the size that is needed. I have a facebook banner for Harris
    that I copied and pasted from somewhere. The quality is just meh. If the campaign
    had a series of fb banners in a media kit that I can copy and paste from, especially
    with messaging that they want out at the moment - I'd prefer to do that. Because
    I'll change my banner weekly or even daily because then it also shows up on my
    newsfeed that I changed it.

  content: 'Hey <@1275254288238776421> thank you for flagging! It''s normal for people
    to feel anxious as we get closer to the election, especially with a race that''s
    so close. CNN isn''t wrong for posting an article that shares a common feeling
    across America at this point in time, but I agree with you that it''s not really
    encouraging and not really a vibe we want to perpetuate in these final days!


    I will say for myself, I started getting involved in campaign work in 2020 because
    I was *so anxious*! And volunteering for the campaign was a way to channel that
    anxious energy into productivity, talking to voters and helping increase turnout!
    I encourage you to put any anxious energy into volunteering (we appreciate you
    being here! <:blueheart:1252803082849488956> ) and encouraging those you encounter
    in real life and online to do the same -- we''re all on the same team and the
    only thing that matters is votes. Polls can vary so wildly and aren''t always
    accurate, so let''s put our energy into people over polls and make sure we''re
    contacting as many voters as possible! <:happysun1:1270566006590541896>'

  content: Are we supposed to put our icebreakers here? favorite moments from the
    campaign this week? The Detroit ad wrote itself, but I also really liked the event
    in Arizona with Tim Walz. It's not that hard to show respect for people. Unless
    you're that other guy, I guess. https://www.c-span.org/video/?539006-1/governor-tim-walz-meets-arizona-native-american-leaders

  content: I hear you, it can feel frustrating to consistently be the party taking
    the higher road when Trump and Project 2025 are blatantly disrespectful and a
    danger to our communities. At the same time, know that there's a diversity of
    voters supporting or getting closer to supporting the Vice President, so she is
    working to appeal to millions of voters, ensuring they all feel as seen and as
    heard as possible. We'd love to have you share content from [Reach on Project
    2025](<https://app.reach.vote/library/label/8fe7a281-3f02-4527-8cd4-e58ba27873ea?campaign=democrats>)

    \ in price overnight the money did not go to the chickens.  When gas jumps the\
    \ oil in the ground did not change.\n\nInflation money goes to the rich.\n\nExample:\
    \ Trump just raised the price of Mar-a-lago membership from $200,000 to $1,000,000.\
    \  Did his cost rise 400%, no.  Did Biden get part of that inflation increase,\
    \ no.  A rich guy, Trump, put it in his pocket.  Who paid?  Well other rich guys\
    \ paid, but they never really pay, they raised prices!  \n\nTrump, and his buddies,\
    \ are not the solution, they are the problem.\n\nNeed more, check out Trump buddy\
    \ Musk, Cyber truck, Musk said $40,000 price now it's $100,000 at cheapest that's\
    \ 150%.  And Musk got a $46 billion, that's $46,000,000,0000 pay package. So why\
    \ is the electronic car guy buddy buddy with President Fossil Fuel?  He doesn't\
    \ want it taxed.\n\nSo, who pays for the rich trying to stay rich?  American consumers\
    \ and taxpayers.\n\nTrying to explain using those simple examples to get the truth\

    will go smoother...I don't know if mankind is afraid to move forward about the
    revealing of God's judgements towards America but he intended for all to want
    to be at least commonly at a stand position of what's already in the making...you
    don't know that the judging isn't for you to have a want it's the position to
    uphold the truthfulness of what's to coming...he is very picky about the representation
    of our Americans and the Republicans need to really step back and allow the way
    of the American people..and address the common way of recovery before the coming
    of God..and Madam Kamala Harris thankyou because you are stepping up especially
    in our time when the life of the innocent had been slain and covered up...I humbly
    thankyou

  content: 'Some business leaders say they don''t like Trump, but they like his economic
    policies vs Harris''s policies. Nonsense. Those business leaders are either ignorant
    of the facts or they are not honest with themselves. Last night''s Rachel Maddow
    show was a brilliant summary of the insanity of business people who support Trump
    for President. Please communicate part or all of this episode in business-oriented
    social media such as LinkedIn. Everyone in the business world needs to understand
    the tremendous advantages of Kamala Harris''s plans and the Biden-Harris economy.

    but I promised to make a post discussing form of engagement here, so this is my
    attempt.  This does not tick all the boxes as it is not original content, nor
    is it particularly pro-Kamala, but it is cleverly anti Trump, and that I like.
    This is my personal Facebook (digital creator profile), but I also shared it to
    Harris for Texas (official space) where we limit Trump content deliberately. Too
    easy to get sucked into mocking him, commiserating etc. We need our energy for
    other things. However, I am pleased with the number of reactions and shares. That
    is rare. I shared the other meme responses, as I did not want to share any names
    here, as a point of privacy.'

  content: "Hi <@892601853873905697> \n\nThe beauty of sharing content from Reach\
    \ is you can also pull tag ideas from the suggested copy and/or the content category.\
    \ By doing so, you can improve any SEO organically and increase the chances your\
    \ post will get picked up by the platform's algorithm.\n\nYou can find suggested\
    \ copy and content categories by clicking share and scrolling down the popup tab.\n\
    \nLastly, I tend to use tags more often on Twitter, Instagram, Threads, Blue Sky,\
    \ and TikTok vs. Facebook, but that is more about how I use that platform vs.\
    \ the others.\n\nLMK if you have further questions!"

    all the wrong ways, and that's why i've been calling her "Mamala" all over the

  content: I'm not the most well informed in AI, but I definitely think it's important
    to highlight and call out misinformation! You might consider turning this into
    a TikTok video as well, or starting a series calling out the mis and disinformation
    from Trump's campaign throughout this election

    out a ballot and drop in the mail - the overwhelming amount of spam. Calls, emails,

  content: The sooner they vote, the sooner they will stop being contacted. In my
    personal opinion, that's a poor reason not to vote. A lot of people care about
    it to make those calls, emails, and texts, and it's easy to unsubscribe from each
    one

  content: I think this artist has been influencing her audience on the issues of
    rising food price, and farmers dignity. I added an expansion on her story and
    she liked it. I told her Kamala-Walz would be focusing on rising prices of essentials,
    foods, in-home healthcare, dignity for the farmers, workers alike. Which is vital
    for developing local economies. Trump is for the Billionaires and they don't care
    about the rise in food prices or any daily essentials which would profit his billionaires.
    This leads to broken families and eventually increases homelessness in the sociaty.
    I told her these things and she wants to, maybe consider writing further on this,
    it seems by her engagements with the idea. I don't like mocking Texans because
    they are all Trump and Elon Musk fans. Telling them the plans would help them,
    atleast understand that Kamala-Walz is a better option for them. I think so.

  content: Thanks for posting - this is from Nate Silver, who Rosenberg argues is
    biased (I'm don't know how strong the evidence for that is). Silver admits that
    Republican polls are biased, but argues they are not strongly biased. This actually
    fits with Rosenberg's argument - he is saying they are trying to be very incremental,
    so that the bias is not noticed, but there is a cumulative effect on the aggregated
    results. He argues they did the same thing in 2022 but on a shorter timescale
    (because they started later), so they had to increase the bias which made it more
    noticeable (and there was a large discrepancy between the predicted "red wave"
    and what actually happened that year). The other key factor (according to Silver)
    is whether the various modelers posting aggregated summaries are properly adjusting
    for bias. Silver claims they are, whereas Rosenberg thinks they are not. Silver
    argues that all the modelers adjust, but do so with different methods, yet come
    to similar conclusions. I don't have a paid subscription so I couldn't read the
    complete article and so cannot comment on how convincing Silver's arguments are
    concerning the adjustments made by the modelers.

  content: Lead Jared (Ky) suggested I forward my inquiry to this channel. I want
    to respond with to my friend (even though she is pro Trump, she is engaging in
    conversation with me on Facebook as well as direct messaging). Please provide
    some key points to respond to the video. Also, why would Facebook be taking the
    video down? Thx

  content: 'A quick personal story, if I may?

    My first career was law-adjacent. I was a discovery lead in civil/class-action
    lawsuits here in my home state of California. Often, this meant I was tracking
    down documents and/or people who didn''t want to be found and once I did, ensuring
    that evidence/testimony/affadavits were shared with all attorneys of record.


    Something I learned then that is applicable today: Follow the money. Follow the
    story (or metadata/digital footprints).


    Fortunately, and in this case, I didn''t have to dig that far. I looked into who
    produced the video and what any incentive might be. Unfortunately, I question
    its validity and its timing; this video you shared is the second in a week with
    a dubious provenance with the intent to cast doubt (or worse) on the character
    of our candidates. I am not going to link what I found because I do not want to
    drive traffic/eyeballs to those sites.


    Your friend isn''t ready. She may never be. At this point, you may consider what
    you want to do with this relationship and/or what is safe and reasonable for you
    both.


    FWIW: I''m sorry.'

  content: An in-depth look at the Polymarket betting market (a platform created by
    Peter Thiel). Right after Elon Musk claimed that betting markets are the best
    predictors of elections, four massive bets (totaling 30 million dollars, possibly
    from one person) were placed. This had a huge effect on the odds - this is blatant
    manipulation! Polymarket is being used as a vehicle for deception to bolster the
    Republican narrative on this election! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1INviKkv7-c

  content: <@853021260849479740> Bill Maher on RealTime New Rules did a good segment
    against the far left. Still the vast majority of Democrats support Israel. I think
    there's equivalents on the far right to our far left and maybe you could equate
    that. There are lots of extremists on the far right and you have some people who
    don't want a genocide on our far left. Maybe that's oversimplifying, but a Harris
    administration seems to me will be very centrist.

  content: 'Hey there <@875215876515823676> !


    I''m not sure if the below was posted here or in another channel, but it might
    be relevant:

    https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2024/09/30/upcoming-2024-restriction-period-for-us-ads/


    While we''re not in the restriction period yet, they could be using existing content
    as a training model for Meta AI. This could cause latency and/or throttle your
    content going out to your followers.


    If you haven''t already, save your post and redo it with one thing different--preferably
    less political. Then post both at roughly the same time and watch the performance.
    Doing so is a way to split test with the intention to rule out a shadow ban.'

    so, they can attempt to re-direct to Kamala positive stuff in the comments. Ideally,
    we would have small teams of dedicated engagers on each platform with others to
    review and coach. For now, those who want to engage can use Reach content and
    official socials content to attempt to re-direct. Thanks again.

    me with little hope of helping move anything forward and unwilling/unable to fight
    against the despair.

    in his handle and not with this attitude. He's expecting a fight. He WANTS me
    to be the arrogant vote scold because it validates his priors. I know how to handle
    him now.

  content: Its totally understandable to be burnt out with the world we're in right
    now... but things won't change unless people stand up and say ENOUGH. TX, for
    example, isn't a red state... it is a state with the majority not voting. If we
    could get them voting.... and with a view of a positive future filled with joy...
    imagine what that could change? Now imagine doing that in every state?! How great
    a world we could live in! We have to keep hope for the future and help others
    do the same.  If not, that person is right and things won't ever get better.

    CNN found out that Fox edited the video about Trump''s barbershop interview. Therefore,
    Trump''s no income tax was just a hoax. In addition, Trump''s rambling speech
    pattern raised questions about his mental decline.'

  content: That was my initial thought. Then I realized they were just dooming from
    Ohio. I encouraged them to find other ways of taking action and they said they
    were likely to still vote for Harris anyway. The big thing was to avoid vote scolding
    them as you're right they were kinda looking for a fight. Refusing to give it
    to them defused the situation.

    I''m an over achiever so I got 3 big ones I can share

    * I amplified Harris''s rally tonight sharing the link to the PBS feed of it

    * I shared an article by independent journalists talking about how and why the
    latest sexual assault accusations against Trump and his connections to Epstein
    matter

    * I highlighted the importance of abortion with a Reach app graphic along personal
    thread about how my mother''s choice to keep me when doctors were told she couldn''t
    even sustain a child until it would survive is the kind of thing that a different
    woman would''ve chosen to have an abortion about and they would''ve been right
    to and how my mother used the story about her decision to show me why someone
    else making a different one would''ve still been okay and equally as valid.'

    This has been debunked. Harris was responding to hecklers and as security was
    escorting them out, they continued shouting but a different set of phrases.


    Harris is a woman of faith and she has spoken about it throughout the campaign.

    I think that you are watching a misleading youtube video. Harris was responding
    to pro-life protesters, not the person who yelled Jesus is Lord.

    From the video of KTSM9 NEWS, you could find out that the crowds of people were
    very noisy, so Harris might not hear the word Jesus is Lord or Jesus is King.'

  content: If you listen carefully to the video you can hear someone in the crowd
    yelling "lies." (The White House transcript quoted "Lies. Lies. That's a lie.")
    It was then that Vice President Harris told them they were at the wrong rally.
    Their Jesus chanting occurred afterward.

  content: I wish we had more specific times for you. I think youre probably good
    with after 8pm. She's the headliner so I also wouldn't expect her on before then
    (especially based on what we've seen with her other events).

  content: 'Hey Guys, I work in digital marketing and I think the media generally
    doesn''t do a great job of being critical of Trump because they too often try
    to just focus on the latest crazy thing instead of putting everything into a broader
    exhaustive context, and doing that in a simple and visual way. It''s really difficult
    for people to hold all of the craziest bits of the last 8+ years in their short
    term memory. The New York Times has some decent visualizations but usually these
    projects are behind their paywall.


    So one of the thoughts I had was to create a site that shows conservative "reviews"
    of Trump in a visual way almost like looking at product reviews or something...I
    didn''t have time to do that, but I did put this together which could be posted
    as a single layout or as social posts. Any thoughts and would anyone happen to
    have decent social reach for something like this? A dedicated "Trump Job References"
    social timeline would be cool, but probably difficult to build followers for an
    account like that account in a short time.'

  content: The illegal crossings issue isn't as salient in my circles as countering
    the narrative that Harris is just as right wing on immigration as Trump is. We
    know it's a lie but the general consensus is that the border bill she's pledged
    to sign is still a bad bill. That said I've seen other commentary that the bad
    parts are all rhetoric and the actual bill INCREASES immigration overall. Anybody
    got a breakdown on that I can share?

  content: 'Hey There <@531166525160423425> !


    Good early catch! You''re not the only one who uploaded their videos to YT and
    then realized hashtags would help an audience find the video.


    There are a couple of ways to do this including having them appear next to your
    title or along with your video''s description. This can be done as you''re uploading
    or after the fact in YouTube Studio.


    I found this video helpful:

    https://youtu.be/Z4MQu3vOT0g?si=UO_NS_f6hsB66GUN


    As to which hashtags to use, ask yourself what your video is about and put yourself
    in someone else''s shoes and ask yourself what is it you''re looking for. You
    can also search various hashtags to see what is popular and/or what fits your
    video''s vibe.


    Good luck and have fun!'

    I''m going to echo what one of our server mods said in one of our general channels:
    All gas, no brakes for the next eight days and thus, no room for distractions.


    I''ve been impressed with your ability to find thought-provoking content to amplify
    and uplift throughout our online channels, and our efforts have yielded some small
    amount of public trust.


    Can I ask you to turn your insight into finding articles which might highlight
    perseverance, resilience, and voter turn out?'

    "America is for Americans and Americans Only". That is a very close translation

    and moving and it even gave me Goosebumps on my scalp but I want to share it with
    you first and you can decide if it can be posted here. It is a very talented singing
    group from England (4 kids and 2 adults) singing about Trump to Bohemian Rhapsody.
    It shows how our friends around the world fear for us and are trying to do their
    part. But it does have 2 mild swear words. I personally don't swear but the overall
    video is so magical and amazing. Can I somehow DM it to you?

  content: I just received a you tube video from  Mark Porter in NJ. He identifies
    himself as a retired newspaper editor, seemed genuine. The video is called "Admire"
    and I admit I am curious to see it, but, of course have not opened it. I have
    copied the url. Is there anyone I should pass it on to?
