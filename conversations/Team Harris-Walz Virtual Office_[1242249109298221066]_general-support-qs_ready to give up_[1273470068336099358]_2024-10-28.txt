Content: I cannot send messages. Each time I try I am told I am not connected to the server. Carolyn B responded and told me I am connected. She asked where I’m trying to post. But guess what? I COULDN’T RESPOND TO HER BECAUSE MY MESSAGES ARE REJECTED. I’m getting ready to give up.

Content: Jeff I also sent you a DM with a suggestion where you clear the storage for the app on your phone. The steps I gave are for Android but I'm sure that iOS has something similar.

Content: I had this happen with another app so I knew that aside from restarting, this trick works. The only thing is I only know how to do it on Android since I never used an iPhone.
