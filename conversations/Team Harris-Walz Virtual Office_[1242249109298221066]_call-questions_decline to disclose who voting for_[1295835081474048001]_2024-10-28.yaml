  content: 'I have had many people who do not want to share who they are voting for,
    FYI: virtually all women, and all in GA. This presents a problem when trying to
    move forward in the call to see if they want polling info. I suspect they are
    pro Harris, because they take the call and talk to me comfortably, and one said
    she would volunteer for the dems! I would liek to click lean-harris in these situations.
    Or can we add a "do not want to disclose" option so that we can move forward with
    data about polling places?'

  content: <@1294056635165184063>  I think "does not want to disclose"  sounds like
    a good idea -- make the suggestion in your debrief form.  "Undecided" would also
    be a good option.  If they are coded as undecided, they will likely get another
    call, but will not be counted in the "Harris" category for prediction purposes.  I
    will post the debrief form link in calls-team

  content: thanks for the note, undecided basically ends the call. I will add to my
    debrief, I might have already.
